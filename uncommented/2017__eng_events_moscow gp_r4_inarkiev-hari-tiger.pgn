1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 {This used to be the favoured move order of Modern Benoni
aficionados like De Firmian, Suba and Vugar Gashimov. The point is to wait for
White to play either Nf3 or g3, before going for a Benoni structure. In this
way Black avoids the Taimanov attack.} (2... c5 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6

I respect anyone who plays this quirky opening. What does the cards say?
Asymmetrical pawn structure, ehhh.} 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 g6 {The Modern Benoni
has a rather dodgy reputation. I sometimes find myself involved in discussion
on the topic: "Which is the more dubious opening; the King's Indian or the
Modern Benoni?" The answer fluctuates, but lately it seems the MBI has been
more under a cloud than the KID. However, I believe there are few GM:S who
would claim that the fianchetto is the most critical set-up against the MBI.
The reason why so many strong players play it has more to do with that it
suits their repertoire (early g3), or that it is less sensitive to theoretical
novelties (I'm guessing now). So, from a MBI perspective, Black is already
quite happy to have avoided the most challenging lines, while still being able
to play the benoni structure.} 6. Bg2 d6 ({Black can try to do without d6 for
a while longer:} 6... Bg7 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Nf3 (8. d6 Nc6 {is what Black is

engine will tell you that Black is only slightly worse, this is really not
good. If we are to give up the d4-square thus in the MBI, we must at least
have White play e2-e4 first, so that we have something to attack. Here White
is solid and Black's pawn structure is... awkward.}) 12. h3 {This is what

{This move is recommended in Avrukh's "1.d4 The Catalan" and that is more than
enough to qualify it as the current main line. White is making it harder for
Black to develop naturally with Nbd7, so Black has to come up with something
else:} Bf5 $5 {A novel development. Black has tried numerous alternatives.} (

tries to undermine it with b5, or f5,or just play around it on the dark
squares. The upside of the fianchetto, is that there is nothing obvious for
Black to aim the forces at. Here a6 is rather a must; a way to keep White's
knight out of b5.} 13. a4 Qe7 {Black prepares to develop with Nbd7.} 14. h3 (
