{Notes by Georg Meier -} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Bf4 {Last year in Berlin at
the World Rapid and Blitz Championships both Carlsen and Kramnik begun to
employ the London system (they had trained together before that event). Their
successes inspired many followers since then. Under Magnus´ reign there has
been a strong tendency to look for structures as White where preparation
matters less than strategic ideas and general understanding. Then the trick
becomes choosing the type of position that your opponent would be most
uncomfortable with, rather than trying to prove an advantage right from the
start.} c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. Nbd2 e6 ({After} 5... Qb6 $6 6. dxc5 Qxb2 7. Rb1 Qc3 {
an engine will tell you that Black is doing alright, but} 8. Bb5 e6 9. O-O Be7

exd4 Qxd4 15. Bd6 {is certainly no pleasure to handle as Black, who´s king
will not find safety.}) 6. c3 cxd4 $5 (6... Bd6 {A lot of top players have
chosen this line against the London system already, so Anish must have spent
most of his preparation coming up with an idea here. And of course he had one
more reason to expect his opponent to go down this road, since Wesley had just
won a beautiful game at the Olympiad:} 7. Bg3 O-O 8. Bd3 b6 9. Qe2 Bb7 10. Rd1

0-1 (34) Sedlak,N-So,W Baku 2016 This reminded me of a cunning strategy Alexei
Shirov likes to employ: He would look for lines where the opponent scored very
well (if he won brilliantly even better), and then see if he could dig up an
unpleasant surprise for them there, expecting that he could put it to use with
near certainty.}) 7. exd4 Nh5 {The tournament leader goes for an original
position, certainly not anticipated by Anish.} 8. Bg5 f6 9. Be3 Bd6 {White
would love to adjust his c-pawn to c4 and the knight to c3, but as it stands
there is no way to put pressure on Black.} 10. g3 O-O 11. Bg2 f5 {Justifying
the h5-knight.} 12. Ne5 $2 {Anish clearly lost the thread here, misevaluating
coming events.} (12. Ng5 Qe8 13. f4 {would keep a balanced position.}) 12... f4
$1 13. Qxh5 fxe3 14. fxe3 Nxe5 (14... Bxe5 $1 15. dxe5 Bd7 {was stronger still,
keeping the pace up. Qb6 and Rf5 are in the air. White faces a grim defence,
as trying to relieve the pressure by} 16. Qe2 Nxe5 17. Nf3 {falls short to}

ease the pressure.} Bxe3 17. Rxf8+ Qxf8 18. Qf3 Qxf3 19. Nxf3 {The worries
about the White king are gone, but certainly Wesley had liked the prospect of
this position as it could become quite passive for White if he were tied to
the defence of the Pe5 (say by a bishop from c7).} Bd7 20. Rd1 Rf8 (20... Bb6 {
may be very precise, since} 21. c4 {is strongly met by} Rc8 22. cxd5 Rc2) 21.
c4 $1 {Anish is correct in trying to liquidate the position as long as he
still can.} (21. Ke2 Bb6 22. c4 {leaves Black a lot of options, and I can
imagine how one could get irritated by something like} Rf7 $5 (22... Kf7 23.
Nd4 dxc4 24. Rf1+ Ke7 25. Rxf8 Kxf8 26. Ke3 Bc7 27. Bxb7 Bxe5 28. Ba6 {would
be quite a defense as well.}) 23. cxd5 Bb5+ 24. Ke1 exd5 25. Rxd5 Bc4 {but
White has a strong rejoinder:} 26. Nd2 $1 Bxa2 27. b3) 21... Bc6 22. Nd4 $2 {
But here} (22. Ke2 $1 Bb6 23. Nd4 {would simply be a better version of the
game:} Bxd4 24. Rxd4 Rf5 25. cxd5 Rxe5+ 26. Kd3 exd5 27. Rf4 $1 {shutting the
Black king out and safeguarding the 2nd rank next} Re1 28. Rf2 {and White´s
perfect coordination neutralizes the extra pawn.}) 22... Bxd4 23. Rxd4 Rf5 24.
g4 {This looks somewhat loose, on g4 the pawn may prove to be exposed.} (24.
Rf4 Rxe5+ 25. Kd2 g5 26. Rf2 {should have been considered, again trying to
lock the Black king out.}) 24... Rxe5+ 25. Kf2 Kf7 $17 26. b4 {White tries to
create some action on the queenside, hoping to liquidate as many pawns as
possible.} Ke7 27. b5 Bd7 28. b6 dxc4 29. Rxc4 axb6 30. Rc7 Rb5 31. Rxb7 Kd6 {
It looks like Black is establishing control, but with so few pawns left, there
are always chances for a succesful defense.} 32. Kg3 h6 33. Rb8 Rb2 {Natural,
but not best.} ({Nr.1 rule when converting a static advantage: Keep an eye on
counterplay at all times!} 33... Rb4 $1 {with the idea to play b5, then Ra4
and not letting the White a-pawn run amok, as in the game.} 34. Rg8 Ra4 35.

White.}) 34. Bf3 b5 $6 35. a4 $1 b4 36. a5 Rb3 37. Kg2 $1 {After this precise

Kxc6 39. a6 Ra3 40. Rxb4 Rxa6 41. h4 {This required no more effort from Anish.
On one side 3 vs 2 promises nothing.} e5 42. Kf3 Kd5 43. Rb5+ Ke6 44. Rb7 Kf6

refreshing display from Wesley in the opening, but Anish put up a defense and
used his last chance to escape.} 1/2-1/2
