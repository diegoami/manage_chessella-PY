1. e4 {(2s)  After two difficult games, in which Topalov needed to work hard to
survive, he wins this game against the ultra-solid Ding Liren in a dramatic game
in order to become sole leader in Sinquefield Cup.} e5 {(5s)} 2. Nf3 {(5s)} Nc6

chooses the fighting "Zaitsev Variation" in order to avoid the 'Spanish torture'.
This line earned respect and popularity thanks to legendary Anatoly Karpov.
The 12th world champion employed this fighting continuation against Kasparov
in their last clash in 1990.} 10. d4 {(16s)} (10. Ng5 {sometimes people repeat

ever annoying Ng5.} 13. Bc2 {( 174s)  Came after some thought. Topalov decides

his preparation or whetehr he just thought that he can save this position. Whatever the case

Black has pair of bishops, losing the a-pawn could lead to a drawish endgame.

the game.} (36. Qxa6 Bxa6 37. Re8 Rf6 (37... Kh7 38. Re6 Bc4 39. Rb6 Rxb6 40.
