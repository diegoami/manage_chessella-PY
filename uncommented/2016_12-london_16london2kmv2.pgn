{Notes by Krikor Mekhitarian -} 1. e4 $1 {By far Anand's #1 choice} c5 2. Nf3
d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {It is always exciting seeing such a
confrontation - Anand, known for his extremely deep and ambitious opening
preparation, continuously finding new ideas and putting problems to his
opponents. In the other side, we have one of the world's top specialist in the
Najdorf variation (as white and black) - current number 4 in the world, having
an amazing 2016 year, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave or simply MVL. Both players have
drawn their first round games, meaning a higher chance they would both seek a
very tense battle.} 6. h3 $5 {[%cal Gg2g4] The Adams attack has become a
fashionable idea against the Najdorf, leading to extremely complicated
positions. I always found it weird to have it called after Michael Adams, who
is such a positional genius (he indeed played it 5 times), but I have just
come to realize it is named after the american master Weaver Adams, who
started playing it back in the 1940s! Black has some options here, e5 being
the most common.} e5 (6... Qc7 {was tried in the very first game of this
variation against Mr. Weaver in 1948} 7. g4 e6 8. Bg2 Nc6 9. Be3 Na5 10. Qe2
Bd7 11. Rd1 h6 12. Bc1 $1 Be7 13. f4 O-O-O 14. O-O $36 {a very odd situation
to have white to castle K-side and black to castle Q-side in an open sicilian.
White went on to win it in 29 moves!: 1-0 (29) Adams,W-Pavey,M Baltimore 1948})
7. Nb3 {Anand has played this 7.Nb3 only once before (in 2014, against
Nepomniachtchi). White's idea is to play something like an english attack 
(with Be3, f4 ideas, or even f4 right away, normally connected with castling
on the Q-side).} (7. Nde2 {[%cal Gg2g4,Ge2g3] is the most common move, aiming
for g4-Ng3} h5 {black normally stops white's K-side expansion with this move,
and white develops with either g3 or Bg5 now, and even the creative Ng1
followed by Nf3 and Ng5 is possible.}) 7... Be6 8. f4 Nbd7 9. g4 $5 {A very
interesting move, preparing f5 under better conditions. Now g5 is a threat.
There are two important games that have similarities to this one:} (9. Qf3 Rc8
10. f5 Bxb3 11. axb3 d5 $5 {is a typical pawn sacrifice that probably led MVL
to an important decision later in this game, as you will see.} 12. exd5 e4 $5 (
12... Bb4 $5) 13. Qg3 Nh5 $13 {with an unclear position: 0-1 (57) Gormally,D 
(2488)-Vachier Lagrave,M (2757) Douglas 2014}) (9. f5 Bxb3 10. axb3 d5 $1 {
right away!} 11. exd5 Bb4 12. Bd2 (12. g4 $2 {now fails drastically} Ne4 $1 $17
) 12... O-O 13. Qe2 Bxc3 14. bxc3 e4 $44 {1-0 (34) Sutovsky,E (2635)-Shirov,A 
(2712) Poikovsky 2015} (14... Nxd5 $5)) 9... Rc8 $146 (9... b5 {has been
played in 2014} 10. Bg2 (10. g5 $6 b4 $1 $132) 10... Nb6 11. g5 Nfd7 12. f5 Bc4
13. Na5 Rc8 $13 {with complex play. 0-1 (32) Khismatullin,D (2714)-Duda,J 
(2563) Yerevan 2014}) 10. f5 (10. g5 $2 {would be a very bad mistake} Rxc3 $1
11. bxc3 (11. gxf6 Rc8 $17 {since white can not take on g7 because of Qh4+})
11... Nxe4 $17 {[%csl Rb3,Rc3,Re1][%cal Gh7h6]}) 10... Bxb3 (10... Bc4 $6 11.
Bxc4 Rxc4 12. Qd3 $16 {[%csl Rd5] the light-squared B exchange is positionally
good for white}) 11. axb3 {[%csl Re1][%cal Gg4g5] It is clear that white's
position is threatening, g5 looks very annoying and Vachier-Lagrave has to do
something, and here he follows a very important advice - meet a flank attack
with a center counterattack!} d5 $5 {Black decided to go for a pawn sacrifice,
to open up the position while white wants to create a wing attack (with g5).
It goes to reinforce the idea that MVL is a very brave player, that doesn't
shy away from complications, even when it is clear that his opponent is in his
preparation.} (11... Rxc3 $5 {was a critical moment - the typical exchange
sacrifice also follows the golden counterattack rule and looks very attractive,
specially because black creates a devastating threat of Qh4+ now:} 12. bxc3
Nxe4 {[%cal Rd8h4]} 13. h4 Qb6 (13... Be7 $5 {is a similar version} 14. g5 Qb6
15. Qf3 d5 $44 {now black has a strong h6! threat, trying to open up even more
lines against the white king.}) 14. Qf3 d5 $44 {as MVL himself mentioned after
the game, was something he was seriously considering and has to be at least
very interesting.}) 12. exd5 Bb4 13. Bg2 Qb6 $2 {natural, but from now on
black faces a difficult position because of this move.} (13... Rxc3 $1 {
would get the pawn back and achieve a complex middlegame position after:} 14.
bxc3 Bxc3+ 15. Bd2 Bxa1 16. Qxa1 O-O {white has the pure bishop pair, but in
the other hand he also has many weaknesses around his king and after:} 17. O-O
Qb6+ $132 {followed by either e4 or Rc8 shows that black's activity could
become very dangerous.}) 14. Bd2 e4 15. Qe2 O-O 16. O-O-O Nc5 17. Kb1 Rfd8 {
The last moves were kind of expected and now the game surrounds about the
moment when black will release the pressure to get the d5-P back, and for many
moves, white's g5 move will need to be analysed.} 18. Rhe1 {a strong move,
bringing the last piece into play, but it was already possible to think about
clearing the dust with the aforementioned g5.} (18. g5 $5 Bxc3 19. Bxc3 Nxd5
20. Bd4 $1 (20. Bxe4 $2 Nxc3+ 21. bxc3 Rxd1+ 22. Rxd1 Na4 $1 $19 {[%csl Rc3]
and suddenly white loses!}) 20... Nf4 21. Qf2 Nxg2 22. Bxc5 Qc6 23. Qxg2 Qxc5
24. Qxe4 $16 {with a promising endgame}) 18... a5 {[%csl Ge1]} (18... Bxc3 $2 {
is simply a worse version compared to the last move analysis.} 19. Bxc3 Nxd5
20. Bd4 $18 {with an additional Rhe1 already played, black has to be in deep
trouble.}) 19. Qf2 $6 {[%csl Rb6,Rc5]} (19. d6 $1 {a very counterintuitive and
difficult move, worsening the black's R position before inserting g5.} Rxd6 20.
g5 $1 {is much stronger now:} Bxc3 21. Bxc3 Nd5 22. Be5 $1 {this is the key,
white wins a very important tempo.} Rdd8 23. Bxe4 Nxe4 24. Qxe4 $18 {with a
winning position.}) 19... Qc7 (19... Bxc3 $1 20. Bxc3 Nxd5 21. Bd4 a4 $1 {
probably underestimated by both players, since apparently black doesn't have
time for such a move. A sample line could go like this:} 22. bxa4 Qb4 $1 {
threatening Nxa4} 23. Qg3 (23. Bxc5 $2 Nc3+ $1 24. Kc1 Nxd1 $1 25. Bxb4 Nxf2
$17) 23... Qxa4 {[%cal Gd5b4] now Nb4 is a serious threat} 24. Qa3 Qxa3 25.
bxa3 $11 {and black has every reason to feel relieved winning the pawn back,
and ruining white's structure on the Q-side.}) 20. Bf4 (20. g5 $5 {it was the
last chance to play this move, but the complications were too scary.} Nxd5 (
20... Bxc3 21. Bxc3 Nxd5 22. Bd4 $16) 21. Nxe4 Nd3 $1 {[%csl Gf2][%cal Gc7c2]}
22. cxd3 Qc2+ 23. Ka1 Qxb3 {threatening Rc2} 24. Rc1 Bxd2 25. Qxd2 (25. Nxd2 $2
Qa4+ 26. Kb1 Nb4 27. Bd5 Nxd5 $17) 25... Nb4 26. Nc3 {All of this was
amazingly mentioned by Anand in the post-game interview (and I'm sure MVL had
similar calculations), showing how good these guys are. He said he wasn't sure
of the evaluation, which is totally understandable, since it involves a
serious risk against your own king! And he is correct, after a4! the position
remains totally unclear.} a4 $1 $40 (26... Rxd3 $2 27. Qe2 $1 $18 {threatening
mate and following with Be4-Bc2})) 20... Qb6 21. Be5 a4 $1 22. bxa4 Bxc3 23.
Bxc3 Nxd5 24. Rxd5 $1 {a good practical decision, maintaining excellent
chances on the following position with the strong bishop pair and many strong
pawns on the Q-side} (24. Bd4 Qb4 $1 $132 {-- 19...Bxc3}) 24... Rxd5 25. Bxe4
Rd6 26. a5 Qb5 {[%cal Gc5a4]} 27. Qe2 $1 Qxe2 28. Rxe2 {now it was urgent for
black to eliminate one of white's strong bishops.} Rd1+ (28... Nxe4 $1 29. Rxe4
Rdc6 30. Ka2 $13 {[%csl Ra5,Rb2,Rb7,Rc2] the pawn majority on the Q-side may
be decisive, and white should have the better prospects, but there is a lot to
be played, it is not too easy to advance those pawns.}) 29. Ka2 Re8 $2 {
a huge mistake, not only because of the way the game continued, but because
black will not be able to deal with these strong bishops} (29... Nxe4 {was
again forced, achieving a similar version of the last move, but having lost an
important tempo.}) 30. Bf3 $1 Rxe2 31. Bxe2 Rc1 32. Bf3 Rxc2 33. Bxb7 $1 {
Maxime resigned since the a-P is unstoppable. A brilliant presentation from
the legendary world champion Vishy Anand, showing hard work with a deep
opening preparation, strong dynamic play and impressive calculations.
Vachier-Lagrave put up a strong resistance after being surprised in the
opening, and could have defended the endgame, if it wasn't fo the final
mistake on move 29. Now Anand joins the 2nd place with three other players at
1,5/2, but for now the man to watch for is Wesley So, with a perfect 2/2 score
and a newly acquired ticket into the 2800 club!} (33. Bxb7 $1 Nxb7 34. a6 {
[%csl Rb7,Gc2][%cal Ga5a6] followed by a7, if the N leaves.} Re2 {the rook is
also not in time:} 35. axb7 Re8 36. Be5 $1 $18 {[%cal Gb7b8]}) 1-0
