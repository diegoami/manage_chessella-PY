Bg5 {Everyone is happy to see this! The players go into the deep jungle, but
to get out unscathed a formidable map is undispensable. One round earlier
Hikaru ran right into quicksand as Black, so he decided to ask Maxime about
the right path.} e6 7. f4 h6 ({To my mind} 7... Qb6 8. Qd2 (8. a3 Nc6) 8...
Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. e5 h6 11. Bh4 dxe5 12. fxe5 Nfd7 13. Ne4 Qxa2 14. Rd1 Qd5

Bd6 f5 22. Bxf8 Nxf8 23. Nd6 Nbd7 {is the latest development. Both Giri and
Vachier-Lagrave showed that Black is fine.}) 8. Bh4 Qb6 9. a3 (9. Qd2 Qxb2 10.
Rb1 Qa3 {could transpose back to 7...Qb6.}) 9... Be7 10. Bf2 {That's the
difference with the move order starting with 7...h6. I like this redeployment
of the bishop, as Black has to relieve pressure on b2, while White gets ready
for a pawn-storm on the kingside against the juicy target created by h6.} Qc7 {
Now White can develop quite harmoniously.} 11. Qf3 Nbd7 12. O-O-O b5 13. g4 {
Things start to heat up! White also seems to have created a target with a2-a3,
but it is much harder to exploit, since Black cannot open up lines on the
queenside.} Bb7 ({The round before we probably witnessed the end of} 13... g5
$6 14. h4 gxf4 15. Be2 b4 $146 {Hikaru's novelty, which led him straight into
a lost position.} ({Maxime had been succesful with} 15... Rg8 16. Rdg1 $2 ({but
} 16. g5 hxg5 17. hxg5 Ne5 18. Qxf4 Nfd7 19. Nxe6 fxe6 20. Rh7 {would have
been big trouble} Bxg5 $2 21. Bh5+ Kd8 22. Bh4) 16... d5 17. exd5 Ne5 18. Qh3
exd5 {0-1 (28) Giri, A-Vachier Lagrave,M Stavanger 2016}) 16. axb4 Ne5 17. Qxf4
Nexg4 18. Bxg4 e5 19. Qxf6 $3 Bxf6 20. Nd5 Qd8 21. Nf5 $1 Rb8 (21... Bxf5 22.
Bxf5 $18 {Picturesque! White is completely dominating. A queen needs targets,
and there is not a single one in White's position. Black cannot get his king
to any safety and unable to open up new lines, he has to await execution
making aimless moves with the heavy pieces.}) 22. Nxf6+ Qxf6 23. Rxd6 {1-0 (32)
Caruana,F-Nakamura,H London 2016}) 14. Bg2 Rc8 15. Kb1 g5 {Again, Black is
fighting for the dark squares on the kingside. But of course this sharp
attempt better be well-prepared at home...} 16. Qh3 Nc5 $2 {Maxime had already
sunk into deep thought and it turns out that he already lost his way.} ({
There are a number of correspondence games with} 16... Nh7 17. e5 (17. f5 $2 e5
18. Nb3 Nhf6 {would allow Black to stabilize}) 17... Bxg2 18. Qxg2 gxf4 19.
exd6 Bxd6 20. Rhe1 Be5 {And here I begun analysing quite a bit out of genuine
curiosity. The move the computer wants to play probably wouldn't enter any
player's head in London: Na2} 21. h3 $5 {This is very abstract too, but I like
this move claiming there is some sort of Zugzwang!} (21. Nf5 exf5 22. gxf5 Ng5
23. h4 Qc6 24. Rd5 f6 25. hxg5 hxg5 {and Black holds}) (21. Na2 O-O 22. Nb4 a5
(22... Bxd4 23. Bxd4 a5 24. Nd3 f3 25. Qf2 b4 26. axb4 axb4 27. Nxb4 Qb7 {
Was seen in the correspondence games, but without a computer's help Black
should have very little chances to survive.}) 23. Na6 Qc4 24. b3 Qc3 25. Rd3
Bxd4 26. Rxc3 Bxc3 27. Rh1 a4 $13) (21. h4 {Looks logical, to get ready for
Black castling, but then he doesn't} Rg8 {and finds a target on g4}) 21... O-O
$6 (21... Rg8 $142 22. Rd3 Kf8 {appears playable for Black though}) 22. g5 $1
hxg5 23. Ne4 $36) 17. Rhe1 {All white's pieces joined the game, next is
blowing up the center.} h5 (17... gxf4 {leads to a long forced sequence:} 18.
g5 Nfd7 19. g6 fxg6 20. Nxe6 Nxe6 21. Qxe6 Ne5 22. Bd4 Qc4 23. Nd5 Bxd5 24.
exd5 Qxc2+ 25. Ka1 Qf5 26. Qxf5 gxf5 27. Bxe5 dxe5 28. d6 Kf7 29. Rxe5 $16 {
The d-pawn will tie Black down.}) 18. Nf5 $1 {...and that's how you do it in
the Najdorf!} Ncxe4 {Keeping control requires precision from White, but his
superior coordination should inspire full confidence that there is always
gonna be a solution.} (18... exf5 19. exf5 Bxg2 20. Qxg2 {Now Black has to try
and stop a breaktrough on the kingside, so:} Rg8 21. fxg5 Rxg5 {does not look
bad at first sight, but} 22. h3 $1 {followed by Bh4 is breaking the blockade
with devastating effect. Black's pieces are in a way shattered, living
separate lives on each side and unable to work together.}) 19. Bxe4 Nxe4 20.
Bd4 $1 {Not exposing c2 and assuming control over the Black kingside.} Rg8 21.
Nxe7 Kxe7 22. gxh5 {White has transformed his initiative into one major asset:
the h-pawn supported by queen and bishop. Of course the Black king's location
in the center makes it impossible to form a succesful defence against its
advance.} gxf4 23. Qh4+ Kf8 (23... f6 {would also expose the 7th rank, adding
more problems.}) 24. Ka1 {Elegant and good enough, since Black cannot repair
his position.} (24. h6 $1 e5 25. h7 Rh8 26. Ka1 $1 {is the computer's
beautiful solution to win the game. Stepping away from c2 takes away any last
trick Black may have.}) 24... b4 {desperation obviously} 25. Nxe4 Bxe4 26. Rxe4
Qxc2 27. Ree1 bxa3 28. Qxf4 axb2+ 29. Bxb2 Rg5 {For the first time all Black's
pieces seem to be working together, he is aiming for an irritating rook swing,
but Hikaru has it all under control.} 30. Qxd6+ Kg8 31. Rg1 $1 {The last
precise move, Black is about to get mated.} Qa4+ 32. Ba3 Rxg1 33. Rxg1+ Kh7 34.
Qd3+ Kh6 35. Rg6+ Kxh5 36. Rg1 f5 37. Qf3+ {So what can we say? Clearly, there
are some real problems in the line Maxime chose, which may require Black to go
back to the trodden paths of 7...Qb6. Otherwise black has to dig deep in the
analysis of 16...Nh7 but it would not appeal to my chess senses at all.
Nowadays you can solve opening problems in a lot of ways with the help of the
computer, but it's necessary to play positions one has a good feel for as well.
Since you cannot repeat all analysis constantly, eventually you'll get a
complicated line you haven't looked at in a while and you will easily misstep
if it does not suit you.} 1-0
