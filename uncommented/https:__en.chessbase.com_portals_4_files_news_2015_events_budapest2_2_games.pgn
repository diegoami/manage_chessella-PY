1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c6 {(!!) An admirable decision. Karpov has never ever played
the Slav in his life, but his never ceasing passion for chess makes him trying
new openings even though nowadays he does not have too much time to study.
When playing the last move, Karpov might not have been aware that his decision
is similar to that of his first historic rival, Kortschnoj. At the age of 70,
Viktor Lvovich used the Slav for almost the first time in his life (exluding a
couple of irrelevant old games) to defeat Boris Gelfand in Biel 2001!} 3. Nc3

O-O Bf5 12. Qd1 Bg7 13. b4 {[#]Following Karpov life was a thrilling
experience. I could not refrain from whispering to my son my thoughts in
whispering mode. The playing hall was set up as a big amfitheatre and we had
our sits quite far from the boards, so I guess the slight violation of the
rules for spectators did not disturb the players in any way. Having studied so
many of Karpov's games as a teen-ager, I was not surprized that I could guess
many of his moves, but I could not help thinking that Karpov was less sure of
himself, since he played very slow and his moves usually arrived at least one
minute after I thought them up. In this moment, though, I could feel the
difference of class between me and my former idol. I told to my son that Black
is doing well with the exception of the fact that his major pieces are not
connected properly, but could not come up with a concrete suggestion. Karpov's
next two moves offer a brilliantly simple solution.} O-O 14. Bb2 Ra8 15. a4 b5

sacrifices on b5.} (15... Qc7 16. b5 e5 {was a worthy alternative.}) 16. cxb6

mere spectator. This piece would have needed the e-pawn to clear the long
diagonal by means of ...e7-e5.} 26. Qb3 g4 27. Ne5 Nd2 28. Qd1 {After this
move Karpov still had around 15 seconds on his clock, but in his hopeless
attempt to find a proper continuation he lost on time.} (28. Qd1 Nxf1 29. Nd6)

Black's win is a simple matter of technique, but Gledura kindly offered a draw,
which ensured him the qualification to the final. I remember Karpov's
explanation of his draw offer with a pawn up in the 24th and last game of the
1974 Candidates' match against Kortschnoj. Karpov was leading with 12-11 and a
draw was enough to get him the right to challenge Fischer. He confessed that
he had little doubt that he could win the last game without too much trouble,
but felt this would have been a bit unfair, as his opponent had been
practically forced to play "va banque" with the black pieces in order to try
equalizing. In the same comment, Karpov also refers to a similar historic
episode from the 1935 Alekhine-Euwe match. Before the 30th and last game, the
Dutch challenger was leading by one point and he told to his opponent that he
would agree to a draw in any kind of position. Which actually happened after
Alekhine's unsuccessful atempts to attack left him two pawns down in the
ending...} 1/2-1/2
