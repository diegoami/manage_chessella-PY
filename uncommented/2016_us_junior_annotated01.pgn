utilize the material advantage, but Black has long-term compensation.} (21...

advantage in this position due to the weak White King.} 30. Rc1 Qe6 31. Qf4 Re8
32. Qe4 $1 Qd7 33. Qc6 $1 {The best strategy for White to defend; Black can't
allow the Queens to be exchanged as it would decrease the initiative
significantly.} Qe7 34. Qe4 Qd7 35. Qc6 Qe7 36. Qc7 {Black can't escape from
the repetitive trade offers and the game ends in a logical draw.} Qe2 37. Qc2

usually taught not to put the Bishop on a square like d3 so early on, as it
blocks the d2 pawn and White's overall development. Here White breaks the
rules in order to maneuver his Bishop to c2 after c3.} b5 7. c4 $1 {This move
has proven to be dangerous, the main reason White switches gears is that c3
can now be tackled by Black going c4, tackling the plan of d2-d4.} g5 $5 {
Black's most agressive option. The Knight on f3 is lured away in order to win
c4 pawn.} 8. Nxg5 Ne5 9. Bf1 $5 {A new way of playing that suprised Michael,

up the development of his pieces.} cxd3 11. f4 Neg4 $6 {An admirable decision,
Black is aiming to sacrifice the Knight in order to compromise the White
King's safety.} 12. h3 $2 {Tempting but not best, this is playing into Black's
hands. Instead the simple:} (12. Qxd3 {Would have been better for White as} c4

pattern works again, and Black is able to draw by perpetual check.} 19. Kh2

merciless in their evaluation of 11...Neg4, but nonetheless it was an
impressive early-game sacrifice on Michael Bodek's part. We're excited to see
what more the 18 year old native of Rochelle, NY has in store for us!} 1/2-1/2

{Game of the day:  Even though the encounter between Ruifeng Li and top seed
Jeffery Xiong ended in a draw, the game was a true spectacle. The players
faced off no less then 37 times prior to this game, having drawn only 3 games
previously. Based on this, fireworks were expected and the players did not
disappoint!} 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {A bit of a surprise, Li normally opts for the
