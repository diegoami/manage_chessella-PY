1. d4 {With both players sitting on 50%, only a victory could create a chance
for winning the tournament. In a classical affair, Aronian punished Naka's
unconventional approach to QGD.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Be7 {Nakamura
is in a solid mood today. He also has good memories: he beat Aronian in Zurich
last February in the very same QGD.} 5. Bf4 {Aronian has played this line
almost exclusively in recent tournaments.} O-O 6. e3 c5 {Nakamura deviates
first} (6... Nbd7 7. c5 c6 8. h3 b6 9. b4 a5 10. a3 h6 11. Bd3 Ba6 12. O-O Bxd3

middlegame. Black is solid, so... any problem trading queens?!} dxc4 9. Bxc4 {
White has more space and better development, and although he has a small edge I am
sure that Aronian had deeply analyzed this position before. A clever choice
that might have caught Nakamura off-guard.} a6 10. Bd3 Nc6 (10... Nbd7 {
is more in the spirit of the position (Not because it is the first choice of
Komodo, believe me).} 11. O-O b5 12. Ne4 Bb7 $5 13. Nxc5 Nxc5 14. Be2 Rc8

White lets Black capture one of his bishops and double his pawns but the 'b7 problem' outweighs all of these minuses. Nakamura might have missed this move.} Nf6 {Nakamura switches his attention from one bishop to another, but...} (15... Nxf4 16. exf4 Ra7 {is probably
better than what Nakamura played in the game.}) 16. Nd2 $1 {Be my guest!
Nakamura constantly attacks White's bishops and Aronian offers them in exchange
for Black's knight everytime.} Re8 (16... Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Be7 18. Bd6 $1 {
And White dominates the dark squares. If you want to learn how to play these
positions with White, I have two names in mind, whoes games might help you:
Alexander Alekhine and Ulf Andersson!}) 17. Bf3 {The cat and mouse game
between Black's knight and White's bishop is over and neither of these pieces
is off the board!} e5 {Nakamura blocks one of the two bishops.} 18. Bg3 Ra7 {
sad necessacity} (18... Bg4 19. Bxb7 Rab8 20. Bf3 Rxb2 21. Nc4 Rc2 22. Rdc1

practically even worse than the game's continuation.}) 19. Rac1 b6 20. a3 Bd7 21.
Nc4 e4 22. Be2 a5 {The position is terrible and it looks like White is
going to win some material soon. However, we all know that Nakamura is not an
easy nut to crack.} 23. Nd6 Re7 24. Nb5 Bxb5 25. Bxb5 $16 {Surprisingly, it is
White who has a pair of bishops now! When I was 15, my coach, GM sarhan Guliev
from Azerbaijan, and I would analyze similar positions in order to develop the technique to win a winning game!} Ra8 26. Kf1 Re6 27. Ke2 g5 28. Bc4

Nakamura and played a very good game. He also brought a new trend in the QGD. How
about playing a queenless middlegame when there is no chance for Black to win?}
