1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 {Berlin invited and declined. Now Black
has a reasonable range of options.} Bc5 (4... Ne7 $5 {is a nice 'tricky' line,
trying to play as if this was an Italian and not a Spanish. Black will
continue ...Ng6, ...Bc5, ...0-0, ...a6, ...d6 if allowed, and abstain from ...
c6.}) (4... d6 {is of course normal:} 5. c3 g6 6. O-O Bg7 7. Re1 O-O 8. Nbd2 a6

exclusively by the Soviet grandmaster Yemelin (a total of 5 occurrences!)}) 9.
Ba4 b5 10. Bc2 Bb7 11. Nf1 Nb8 $5 {For me this is a trademark Howell manoeuvre.
Black went on to win in McShane,L -Howell,D London 2017.}) 5. O-O Nd4 $5 {
Partly 'telegraphed' by the previous move (though 4...d6 is still more common.)
My understanding used to be that Black was slightly worse after this move, but
maybe after annotating the present game and seeing a comprehensive list of
world elite players having taken the Black side, that will have to change.} (
5... O-O $2 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. Nxe5 $16 {is now essentially just a pawn.}) 6. Nxd4
Bxd4 7. Ba4 {Presumably there is some move-order subtlety going on here
beneath the surface. My best guess is that White is 'threatening' Nd2 with
this move, and Black faces problems preserving his d4-bishop.} (7. c3 Bb6 8.
Na3 O-O (8... c6 $5 {would be the 'Yugoslav approach':} 9. Ba4 h6 10. d4 d6 $11

such lines with a queen exchange.}) 9. Bg5 c6 10. Ba4 h6 11. Bh4 d6 (11... d5

central pawns:} 12. exd5 cxd5 13. Re1 Bc7 $132) 12. Nc4 Bc7 13. Ne3 Bb6 14. Qf3
$14 {Karjakin as Black limped to a draw a pawn down against Anand here in the
blitz section of last year's Norway chess event.}) 7... c6 (7... O-O {looks
perfectly playable: while it is usually advisable for Black to go ...c6 in
such lines, it is not a biblical commandment.} 8. Nd2 d6 $1 9. c3 Bb6 10. Nc4
$1 {Presumably this was Black's problem- these configurations with a bishop
pair that White can take 'on demand' are generally a little inauspicious.
However in this case, I doubt Black is worse after} Be6 11. Nxb6 axb6 {and now
White's most natural choice} 12. f4 {is met by the computerish} b5 $1 13. Bxb5

the note to White's 7th.}) 10. Bc2 (10. Bb3 {is very 'Italian', but does seem
like a second semi-waste of a tempo, this bishop not having been obligated to
move at all.} a5 11. Nc4 Ba7 $1 {Also in Italian style.} 12. a4 O-O 13. Bg5 h6

Black had obtained his preparation and was ultimately successful in
Carlsen-Aronian, European Team Championships 2015.}) 10... Be6 11. Qe2 h6 (
11... O-O {was more modest, and probably best, since a madcap kingside attack
is unlikely to work well at this level, but the text does make the game
interesting.}) 12. Kh1 g5 13. Nc4 Bc7 14. Ne3 {Around this phase I was unable
to find many reasons to play one move first rather than another, since in any
case it is impossible to discourage Black from playing ...d5.} (14. a4 {
is another generally useful move that features in most of White's plans.}) (14.
Rd1 $5 {followed by d4 is independent, but maybe now Black would revert to the
original plan and play} O-O 15. Ne3 (15. d4 Bxc4 16. Qxc4 d5 $11) 15... d5 $11)
14... d5 15. Re1 Qe7 (15... d4 16. Nf5 Bxf5 17. exf5 Kf8 $11 {was the engine
suggestion, the rationale being that Black is probably going to eventually
trade this pair of minor pieces on f5 in any case.}) 16. a4 O-O-O 17. Rb1 $6 (
17. exd5 Nxd5 18. Nxd5 Bxd5 19. Be3 $11 {might have been better, with
approximate equality. The text was an indication that White believed himself
to be better, possibly significantly so.}) 17... d4 18. Nf1 Bb6 $6 {This is a
hard move to explain with any sort of rationale other than possibly being
excessively obsessed with how to take back on d4.} (18... Nd7 $15 {is my
engine choice, maybe thinking about an eventual ...f5. The irony of this
position is that it is Black's c7-bishop rather than White's c2-bishop which
might be opened soon in a 'Spanish' way.}) (18... g4 $1 {is the move that
makes most sense to me. Probably what Wesley didn't like was} 19. cxd4 exd4 20.
f4 $6 {when it looks like there is a risk of being outflanked, but after a
solid continuation like} gxf3 21. Qxf3 Ng4 $1 $17 {Black is doing extremely
well.}) 19. Bd2 Bg4 20. f3 Be6 21. Ng3 $14 {So Black has created his 'hook' in
White's position, but it is all a bit slow and there is a real risk of getting
outflanked along the f-file.} Rhg8 (21... Ne8 22. c4 Ng7 23. b4 h5 {might have
been an interesting race, but the engine opines that White can play} 24. Nf5 {
anyway and be better.}) 22. b4 {Now White has near-total control over the
events to come.} g4 23. a5 (23. cxd4 Bxd4 24. f4 $14 {is another way, and
maybe the best one.}) 23... dxc3 $1 {A very good practical decision.} (23...
Bc7 24. Rf1 $14) 24. Bxc3 Bd4 25. Bxd4 Rxd4 26. b5 {Losing claim to an
advantage in my opinion.} (26. f4 exf4 27. Qf2 Rgd8 28. Ne2 g3 29. Qxf4 Nh5 30.

the woods yet, even if he might appear to have great compensation.}) 26... c5 (

than three pawns to push to the 6th rank, but the engine is unfazed and claims
Black has equalised.}) 30. Rbc1 gxf3 $6 {Now this is a dubious decision. Chess
is such a fickle game sometimes.} (30... Kb8 31. Bc4 Nd5 $14) 31. Qxf3 Red8 32.

the game a little.} (37. Rxc5 $1 {was playable, quite natural, and very close
to winning.}) 37... axb6 38. axb6 Ng4 (38... Rd2 39. Qg1 Nxd5 40. exd5 Qxd5 $16

but move 40 was still to come...} (39... Rd2 40. Rf1 h4 41. h3 Qg3 {White
might still win somehow, but it will be hard with his queen boxed in in this
way.}) 40. h3 $4 (40. Bxb7 $18 {was safe for instance.}) 40... Rxh3+ 41. gxh3

no way to avoid mate other than giving up his queen.} 43. Qg2 Qh8+ 44. Kg1
