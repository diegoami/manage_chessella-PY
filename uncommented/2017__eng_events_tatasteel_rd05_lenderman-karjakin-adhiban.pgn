{Welcome everyone! This is GM Aleksandr Lenderman with the analysis of the
round 5 Game of the Day from the 2017 Tata Steel tournament. This round there
were many interesting games, and also a big shake up in the standings, as the
leader after 4 rounds, GM Pavel Eljanov got ambitious against Levon Aronian
and ended up getting outplayed and lost, while GM Wesley So continued his
great form, with a nice win against GM Pentala Harikrishna. However, for Game
of the Day, I decided to choose Adhiban's win against GM Sergey Karjakin
because very rarely do we see a player as strong as Sergey Karjakin lose with
white in such a convincing matter, and I also thought the game had theoretical
significance.} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7.
Be3 Be7 8. Qd2 a6 $5 {Even though in the last 3 years I've been almost
primarily a French player, somehow this move order involving Be7 followed by
a6 or vise versa slipped out of my view. I always thought that normally after
White plays 7. Be3, and then Black either plays a6 followed by b5, or Be7
followed by 0-0. But this move order, while used less often, has been used by
great players, in particular Hikaru Nakamura with black a few times, and more
recently GM Anton Korobov and one of the biggest French specialists that I
know, GM Matthias Bluebaum.} (8... O-O {This is more standard and leads to
sharp games often and has been seen quite often in practice}) 9. a3 {This
seems like the most popular move now in this position, possibly because
Kramnik played it against Meier in the 2016 Baku Olympiad. However, other
moves are certainly possible and deserve separate analysis.} (9. Bd3 $5 {

means it is still his opening preparation. After Nd7!?, Sergey Karjakin
thought for about 10 minutes, so he was probably surprised.} (11... b6 {

up a piece but Black has tremendous compensation due to very active pieces,
two strong bishops and a very strong central control. Very deep analysis of
this position requires to know if this is enough for Black. It's possible both
Karjakin and Adhiban knew about the Kramnik-Meier and Ragger-Bluebaum games,
and possibly this is good for White, and therefore Adhiban decided to take an
independent route.} Rf2+ 23. Kd3 Bf4 24. Ne2 Bh6 25. c4 Kg8 26. Rd1 Bd7 27. Nc3

to avoid playing against very strong Adhiban's preparation} (15. O-O-O {

Sergey didn't want to allow extra possibilities like Bg5 or e5, or even just
b5 with a straight forward attacking plan for Black, but possibly they are not
as scary as they seem objectively.} b5 (15... e5 16. Bc5 $1 {The only move for

more pleasant position and he can go Bd4 next move once his queen got out of

computer gives White some edge, but from a practical standpoint of view it is
probably easier to play Black because he has the initiative. Also in between
there are many pitfalls and White has to find lots of accurate moves just to
get to this position. So it seems like it's very good practical preparation by
Adhiban. But now that it's been played, it's unclear whether there will be too
many followers of this interesting idea, now that there is less surprise value
now, and professionals will be able to analyze this position now deeply with
their engines which are more powerful than mine.}) 15... Qxf6 16. g3 g5 $1 {

really not being utilized to its maximum, and you can basically say that about

activate his knight on c3.} (19. Rd4 $1 Ne5 20. Rf4 Qg7 21. Na4 {[%cal Gc3a4]

to me, is far from obvious.} 35. Ng4 d4 36. Rg7+ Kd6 $19 {If Adhiban
calculated to this position and saw he's winning by force, then it's brilliant,
but to me from a human standpoint of view, I would be a bit afraid to put my
king like this all the way to d6, since in a position like this, a single
misstep can suddenly change the evaluation of the position. But I will give
him the benefit of the doubt here.}) 31... Bxd3+ {And White loses more
material and is completely lost so he resigned. As a regular French player
myself, I cannot help but wonder why the French defence is not played more
often at the elite level. And it seems like when it does get played, more
often than not Black seems to get very interesting games, and very often the
opening is a success for Black. That's why I was very happy to see a game like
this where the French defence proved to be alive and kicking, and what's more:
against a super-elite player, one of the best 1. e4 players of the current
generation, and a player who just played for the World Championship match and
must've prepared deeply for every opening. If even someone as strong and
well-prepared as Sergey Karjakin can be humbled like this in this French maze,
I still wonder why the French is not a more frequent guest at the top level.
Possibly games like this will make it more popular!} 0-1
