{While the tournament leader, Wesley So, scored another victory against
out-of-form Veselin Topalov, two of his chasers, said to be the most probable
challengers for the world title in 2018, clashed in a principled battle.} 1. e4
c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Nakamura played the Najdorf
System against Caruana in their latest resultive classic game (US Championship,
Saint Louis, April 2016)... and lost! Since then Fabiano and Hikaru only met
in rapid (or semi-rapid, as in the "Champions Showdown" last month) and blitz
events, and Nakamura always replied 1...e5 to 1.e4. Does he think that the
Najdorf is a "more serious" opening than 1...e5 :-)?} 6. Bg5 {This "main" move
is a rare guest in Caruana's practice. He plays various systems against the
Najdorf but lately his main weapon was the English Attack, starting with 6.f3 
(that's what he played against Nakamura in Saint Louis). However, it looks
like Hikaru was not surprised.} e6 7. f4 h6 {Apparently, Nakamura had never
played this line before the present game. However, Caruana didn't miss it when
preparing to play 6.Bg5.} 8. Bh4 Qb6 {This aggressive continuation is probably
more popular on move 7 but it is by no means new in this position, too.} 9. a3
{One of the main theoretical moves. White indirectly protects his b2 pawn and
prepares to oust Black's queen by means of Bh4-f2.} (9. Qd2 {, sacrificing the
b2 pawn, is the main alternative.}) 9... Be7 ({Of course,} 9... Qxb2 $4 {
loses the queen due to} 10. Na4) (9... Nbd7) (9... Nc6 {and even}) (9... Bd7 {
are the other moves frequently seen in practice.}) 10. Bf2 Qc7 11. Qf3 Nbd7 12.
O-O-O b5 13. g4 {Both sides have made typical attacking knight pawn moves;
however, their impet is slowed down by the rook pawns, which have already
moved to a3 and h6...} g5 {...and besides, Black has a possibility to strike a
sudden counterblow, with an obvious idea to gain the e5 square for his knight.}
14. h4 $5 gxf4 15. Be2 {This apparently strange sequence of moves was seen for
the first time in a correspondence game and later, at the super-GM level, in
Giri - Vachier-Lagrave (Stavanger 2016). White creates the g4-g5 threat and
protects the g4 pawn in case of ...Nd7-e5 Qf3xf4.} b4 $5 {Played instantly,
which means that this move was prepared at home. In his annotations for
ChessBase Magazine, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave examines a lot of moves but not
this one! However, it was obviously not secret for yesterday's opponents.} ({
The French Grandmaster played} 15... Rg8 {in the above-mentioned game, to
which, according to his analysis, White could have sacrificed a pawn:} 16. g5
$1 {with a powerful attack} ({instead of} 16. Rdg1 {, played by Anish Giri})) (
{To understand the idea of 15...b4, we must take a look at the following line:
} 15... Ne5 16. Qxf4 Nexg4 $1 17. Bxg4 e5 {(looks very strong but White has an
adequate riposte)} 18. Nd5 $1 Nxd5 19. Qf3 {- White avoids serious material
losses and keeps a strong attack at Black's uncastled king, e.g.} Bxg4 20. Qxg4
Nf6 21. Qf3 exd4 22. Bxd4 {regaining the piece since} Qd8 $2 {is clearly bad
due to} 23. e5 {(Indicated by Vachier-Lagrave).}) 16. axb4 Ne5 17. Qxf4 Nexg4
18. Bxg4 e5 {Now we see the difference.} ({In case of} 18... e5 19. Nd5 Nxd5
20. Qf3 {Black can simply play} Nxb4 {. White's d4 knight can't retreat, the
only way for him to avoid losing a piece is} 21. Be1 a5 22. Bxb4 axb4 {,
opening the a-file for Black, after which the latter obtains an excellent
counterplay. However, White has another option...}) 19. Qxf6 $1 {This queen
sacrifice is not difficult, in fact, but what followed next was really amazing.
} Bxf6 20. Nd5 Qd8 21. Nf5 $3 {After this move Hikaru fell into a deep thought
for the first time in this game!} ({In his analysis he obviously expected} 21.
Nc6 Bxg4 22. Nxd8 Bxd8 {This endgame is unclear, both sides have their merits
and drawbacks. Black has more weaknesses but his bishop pair should not be
underestimated. Instead, Fabiano renounces restoring the material balance! I
must say that such "real" queen sacrifices are an Achilles' heel of analytic
engines. They almost always evaluate positions with, say, two minor pieces for
a queen in favour of the strongest piece, while in reality, in human play,
there may be a more than sufficient compensation for the material. Therefore
such positions should be analysed and evaluated "manually", and kudos to
Caruana and his team for doing that!}) 21... Rb8 $6 {Black prevents 22.Bb6 but
allows 22.Nxf6+ Qxf6 23.Nxd6+ (or 23.Rxd6), which proves to be fatal for him.}
({He could have parried both threats by just trading White's dangerous knight:
} 21... Bxf5 22. Bxf5 Rb8 {but then the weakness of light squares around his
king could have become decisive. Computer engines show equality here, which
means that Black's position is almost hopeless :-). White could have played}
23. Rd3 {with idea Ra3 or Rc3} ({or simply} 23. c4)) 22. Nxf6+ Qxf6 23. Rxd6 $6
{Alas, White fails to find the strongest but very difficult continuation,
which means that either Caruana did not analyse 21...Rb8 at all or forgot his
analysis. I bet for the former suggestion since the variations are really
amazing and must stock up in one's memory:} (23. Nxd6+ $1 Ke7 ({to} 23... Kf8 {
White has an amazing move} 24. Bf5 $3 {followed by Bf2-c5, and Black's king,
"pressed against the ropes", is completely helpless}) (23... Qxd6 {is hopeless
due to} 24. Rxd6 Bxg4 25. Rxa6 {with a decisive material advantage for White})
24. Bc5 $3 Qf4+ {(forced)} (24... Bxg4 25. Nb5+ {followed by mate on c7}) 25.
Kb1 Qxg4 (25... Bxg4 {again leads to a mate after} 26. Nf5+) 26. Nxc8+ Ke8 (
26... Kf6 27. Rhf1+ Kg7 28. Rg1 $18 {with decisive material gains for White})
27. Nd6+ Kd7 {(again the only move)} (27... Ke7 28. Nf5+ Ke8 29. Rhg1 $18 {
- Black's queen can't retreat in view of Nf5-g7#}) 28. Nxf7+ Kc7 {(other
retreats are worse)} ({e.g.} 28... Ke6 29. Nxh8 Rxh8 30. Rhf1 {with an
inevitable deadly check on d6}) 29. Bd6+ Kb7 {(once again, there are no better
king moves)} 30. Bxb8 Rxb8 31. Nxe5 {, and White keeps a rook, knight and
three pawns for the queen, which is quite enough to win, since} Qxe4 $6 32. Nd7
{loses an exchange, after which two rooks easily deal with Black's lone queen.}
) 23... Be6 {Black is ready to castle. However, his position is still poor.}
24. Rhd1 ({Another way to meet Black's castling was} 24. Be3 Rxb4 $1 ({if} 
24... O-O {then} 25. Nxh6+ Kh8 (25... Kg7 26. Rg1) 26. Nxf7+ $1 Qxf7 27. Rxe6 {
, and Black's king is helpless.}) ({an attempt to free Black's queen:} 24...

in case of} 25... Bxf5 26. Rxf6 Bxg4 27. Bxh6 Rxe4 {White keeps an extra pawn
and good winning chances}) 26. Nxh6+ Kh8 27. Bf5 $1 (27. Nxf7+ Qxf7 28. Rxe6 {
is now premature due to} Rxe4 {; White must prepare that blow}) 27... Qd8 28.
Nxf7+ $1 Rxf7 29. Rxe6 Rxf5 $1 {(Black must get rid of White's terrifying
bishop)} 30. Rh6+ (30. exf5 Rg4 $1 {is less clear}) 30... Kg8 31. Rg1+ Kf7 32.
Rh7+ Ke6 33. exf5+ Kxf5 $16 {Despite an approximate material parity, White has
a clear advantage: a passed h4 pawn, and Black's "centralized" king is in
danger; still, the outcome of the game is not quite certain.}) 24... O-O 25. h5
$1 {(threatening 26.Bh4)} Qg5+ ({Black didn't bring himself to put his queen
to the corner by} 25... Rfe8 26. Bh4 Qh8 {but that was the most stubborn
defense. White should probably continue positionally:} 27. Ne3 $1 (27. Ne7+ {
is not enough due to} Rxe7 28. Bxe7 Bxg4 29. Rd8+ Rxd8 30. Rxd8+ Kh7 31. Rxh8+
Kxh8 {, and Black should not lose this endgame with opposite-coloured bishops})
27... Qg7 28. Rg1 Kf8 29. Rdd1 $16 {Black's position is very difficult to
defend, of course.}) 26. Be3 Qf6 ({Of course, not} 26... Qxg4 27. Nxh6+) 27.
Nxh6+ Kh8 28. Bf5 {Caruana spent some time calculating the blow on f7 but
finally prefered a strong positional continuation, making Nxf7+ a more
powerful threat.} (28. Nxf7+ {was possible but Black had the following defense:
} Rxf7 29. Rxe6 Qh4 $1 30. Bf5 {(threatening 31.Rh6+ since Black will be
unable to reply 31...Rh7)} Rxf5 $1 {(here, too, Black must eliminate this
bishop)} 31. exf5 (31. Rh6+ {was a good alternative:} Kg8 32. Rg1+ Kf7 33. Rh7+
Ke6 34. exf5+ Kxf5 35. Rf1+ Ke6 36. Rh6+ Kd5 37. Bd2 $16 {with a favorable
position, similar to the one examined in the 24.Be3 line}) 31... Qxb4 {, and
the forced line} 32. Rh6+ Kg8 33. Rg1+ Kf7 34. Rh7+ Kf6 35. Rg6+ Kxf5 36. Rf7+
Ke4 37. Rg4+ Kxe3 38. Rxb4 Rxb4 {leads to a rook endgame with an extra pawn
for White, which, I believe, should be winning for him despite Black's passed
e-pawn. But, of course, calculating this line and evaluating the final
position is a very difficult task over the board.}) 28... Qe7 $2 {Nakamura
succumbs to the pressure. His move doesn't parry the Nxf7+ threat.} (28... Rxb4
$2 29. Nxf7+ Qxf7 30. Rxe6 {was obviously hopeless}) (28... Rbd8 {doesn't work
due to the simple} 29. Rxd8 Rxd8 30. Rxd8+ Qxd8 31. Bxe6 {, and White gets a
third piece for the queen;} Qh4 {doesn't help here due to} 32. Nxf7+ Kg7 ({or} 
32... Kh7 33. Kb1) 33. Bh6+ $1 Kh7 34. b3 {: Black can't take the e4 pawn in
view of the knight fork; well, he can take the h5 pawn but White keeps a
decisive material advantage anyway}) ({to} 28... Qh4 {White can reply} 29. Rg1

arising after 28.Nxf7+}) 29... Qxh5 {(what else?)} 30. Nxf7+ $1 Rxf7 (30...

was the most stubborn defense. White can continue} 29. Rg1 ({or} 29. c3) ({
but not} 29. Rxa6 $2 Ra8 {, and Black obtains counterplay}) 29... Rxb4 30. Rxa6
{with a huge advantage.}) 29. b5 $6 {The idea of this move is either to close
the b-file or to deflect Black's rook from the 8th rank. However, such
"niceties" were excessive!} ({Black prepared to meet} 29. Nxf7+ Rxf7 30. Rxe6 {
with} Qxb4 {followed by} 31. Rh6+ Kg8 32. Rg1+ Rg7 ({but not} 32... Kf8 33.

the excellent move} 34. Bc5+ $3 ({instead of the obvious} 34. Rh8+ Ke7 35.

calculated and concluded that Black could successfully continue resistance})

simply play} 33. c3 {parrying all future threats}) (29... Rxb5 30. Nxf7+ Rxf7

here Black's queen is placed worse than on b4.} 32. Rh6+ {BLACK RESIGNED
forseeing the following line. Nakamura's opening surprise (15...b4) was met
with an excellent counter-surprise (21.Nf5!!). Black's queen was absolutely
powerless against White's minor pieces. Of course, the unsafe position of
Black's king made the greatest contribution to his defeat. Unfortunately,
Caruana didn't find the simplest paths to a win at several occasions but he
never let his advantage slip and finally brought it home. Fabiano didn't
manage to catch the leader but keeps closely chasing him. Last three rounds of
the tournament are going to be exciting!} ({After} 32. Rh6+ Kg8 33. Rg1+ Rg7

mate on e1, and ...Qxb2+ will be completely harmless; therefore, White can
simply continue} 37. Rh6 $18 {with decisive threats.}) 1-0
