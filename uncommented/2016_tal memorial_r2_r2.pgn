1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O $5 {Playing a King's Indian, as the
next move protects d5. Giri is certainly more known for his Grunfeld.} 5. Nc3
Nc6 $5 {But actually this move almot transposes back to Grunfeld channels.} 6.
e3 {Avoiding d5 at all cost! However e3 isn't considered a dangerous set up
against the KID.} (6. Nf3 d5 {is the way MVL plays this variation, simply
going back to his favorite opening. Of course, there is a chance that Giri
would have played 6...d6, but we will never know.}) 6... d6 7. Nge2 e5 8. O-O
exd4 9. exd4 Ne7 $5 {An unusual move in a well known position. Most of the
time Black plays for a Bf5-Re7 plan, fighting for e4.} 10. Bf4 Nf5 11. Qc1 {
Withoute the possibility of playing Bh6, at least not yet, this move baffles
me a bit.} (11. h3 {with the potential idea of g4 might be better to do right
away.}) 11... Re8 12. h3 c6 13. g4 Ne7 14. Bh6 d5 15. c5 {It seems foolish to
play with an isolated pawn, so Gelfand grabs the space on the queenside.} b6
16. cxb6 (16. b4 {seems more natural to me, though after} a5 17. a3 axb4 18.
Bxg7 Kxg7 19. axb4 Rxa1 20. Qxa1 h5 {Black shouldn't have real problems.})
16... axb6 17. Re1 Bh8 18. Qf4 Nd7 19. Qd2 Nf8 20. Nf4 Ne6 21. Nce2 (21. Nxe6
Bxe6 22. b3 $11) 21... c5 $1 {It looks like this break can't be played,
because it loses the d5 pawn, but Giri has decided that the activity is fully
worth the pawn. An excellent decision.} 22. dxc5 bxc5 23. Nxd5 (23. Nc3 {
was probably better, but it is hard to resist the pawn.} Ra6 $5 {Is a computer
idea, with Rd6 coming up soon in certain variations.}) 23... Bb7 {The activity
is based on the Benko-style pressure against the b and a pawns and the
potential weakness of White's king.} 24. Nec3 Nxd5 25. Nxd5 Bd4 {Of course,
having the d4 square for the bishop is also quite juicy.} 26. Nc3 (26. Nf4 $1 {
was a better way of trying to hold everything together, though Black's
initiative is still strong.}) 26... Bxg2 27. Kxg2 g5 $1 {Exploiting another
one of White's problems: now the bishop on h6 is trapped!} 28. h4 (28. Rxe6
Rxe6 29. Bxg5 Qb6 {is very unpleasant for Gelfand.}) 28... gxh4 {The pawn on
h4 is actually rather powerful, as it aids in the attack against White's king.}
29. Ne4 Qd5 30. f3 Rad8 $6 {The inclusion of Rd8 and Rd1 in most lines favors
White. Kh8 immediately was better.} 31. Rad1 Kh8 32. Bg5 f5 $1 {An excellent
move, keeping up the pressure.} 33. Bxd8 Rxd8 {Black has sacrificed a full
exchange, but it is not easy to defend the knight on e4.} 34. gxf5 $2 {Losing
instantly.} (34. Qh6 $1 fxe4 35. Rxe4 h3+ $1 {Is messy, but should favor Black.
}) (34. Ng5 h3+ 35. Kh2 Be5+ 36. Kh1 Qxd2 37. Rxd2 Rxd2 38. Nxe6 Bg3 {looks
like a very bad endgame for White, if not just lost.}) 34... Qxf5 35. Kh1 Rg8 {
White is defenseless against Black's relatively simple threats.} 36. Rf1 Be5 {
Coering hCovering h2, White cannot do anything against Qh3 and mate.} 0-1

this is all following the game between Giri-Svidler, a crucial victory for the
Russian in the World Cup last year!} 19. Ne3 (19. Ng3 Bc8 (19... Bc3 $5 {

analysis will be needed to determine the differences.}) 24. bxa4 Nde5 25. f4 {
It is clear that after this move Black must sacrifice his piece. Anand
considers this version to be better for White than without the a4 break.
Thorough analysis will be found in a future ChessBase Magazine edition, but
for now it seems that the former World Champion is correct.} Nxf4 26. gxf4 Qxf4

position.} 29. Qe2 Qg4+ {A surprising decision, to exchange queens in this

pieces.}) 30. Qxg4 Bxg4 31. a3 Nf3+ 32. Kf2 Nd4 33. Rb2 bxa3 34. Rxa3 Nxc2 35.

combination of the power of the passed a pawn and the possibility for White's
pieces to activate give him an almost winning advantage.} Bc8 37. Re3 {Based
on a miscalculation.} (37. Rb2 $1 {was easier.}) 37... Rf4+ 38. Rf3 (38. Kg3

the bishop, which incidentally also cannot be defended.}) 54. Rg3 {Nothing to
