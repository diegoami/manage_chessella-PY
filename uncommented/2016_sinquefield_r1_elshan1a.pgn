1. e4 {Anish Giri must have been very well prepared for this game since MVL
plays the Najdorf almost exclusively.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5.
Nc3 a6 {There we are!} 6. Be3 Ng4 {MVL has a number of games here too, most
notably against Ivanchuk in Tata Steel 2015. This move gained respect and
found its way into theory books thanks to Kasparov's games in 1990s.} 7. Bc1 {
Draw? Or Giri is trying to force English attack?} Nf6 8. f3 {No one likes a
short draw of course! Anish forces the game into the English attack.} e5 9. Nb3
Be6 {Both parties are developing their pieces according to very well-known
theory of this opening.} 10. Be3 Be7 (10... Nbd7 {followed by h5 is a less
theoretic, yet riskier choice.}) 11. Qd2 O-O 12. O-O-O Nbd7 {[#] The players
follow the most popular and most direct continuation. The following moves are
more or less forced.} 13. g4 b5 14. g5 b4 15. gxf6 (15. Ne2 {used to be the
main line when I was a 'young GM'. However, recent theoretical improvements
have shown that this is just a draw!} Ne8 16. f4 a5 17. f5 a4 18. fxe6 axb3 19.

18... Qd7) (18... Qc7) 19. Nxe7+ Qxe7 20. Qa5 {We are still following the most
popular continuation. There is nothing new to talk about, yet!} Rc6 21. Kb1
Rfc8 22. Rd2 {Ok, now we only have 46 games, according to ChessBase Online
database!} Nh5 23. Rg1 Qh4 $146 {According to my database this move is novelty.
The idea seems very simple. Black wants to mate white in the back rank!
However, jokes aside, black plans to activate his pieces in a move active
manner compared to when the queen is on f6.} (23... Qf6) (23... g6) (23... h6 {
have been played}) 24. Be2 $1 {The h2 pawn is of coure a taboo. Giri's
reaction is deep. He transfers his bishop to d1 in order to cover both f3 and
c2, as well as his back-rank.} Nf4 (24... Qxh2 $4 25. Bxa6) 25. Bd1 $1 f5 $6 {
Computers do not like this move but black has to do something here and this
move is a typical reaction in this sort of positions.} (25... h6 {is one of
many suggestions of engines.}) 26. exf5 Bxf5 27. Ka1 d5 {This is also a forced
move. Otherwise white would play c3 and Bb3 with an unplesant attack for white,
on both sides! MVL correctly tries to diminish the material on the board.} (
27... Bxc2 28. Rxc2 Rxc2 29. Bxc2 Rxc2 30. Qa4 $1 {[%csl Yc2,Re8][%cal Ga4e8,
Ga4c2]} Rc8 31. Qd7 {[%csl Yc8][%cal Gd7g7]}) 28. c3 Rg6 $1 {This does not
change the evaluation of the position but it is a good practical decision.} 29.
Rxg6 hxg6 30. Bxf4 Qxf4 31. Qxd5+ {Ok, white is a pawn up but he is far from
winning. All of black's pieces are active and white still needs to do
something about his weak back rank.} Kh7 32. Bb3 a5 33. a4 $1 {Giri is very
accurate!} Re8 {Now Giri is closest to win than ever, however, his next move
throws the win away on spot.} 34. Ka2 $4 (34. Qb5 Re7 (34... Qxd2 35. Qxe8 Qc1+
36. Ka2 Qb1+ 37. Ka3 Qa1+ 38. Ba2 Qe1 39. f4 $18 {black has to give up queen
or let white to mate him on g8 and then h8.}) 35. Rd6 Qxf3 36. Ka2 Qe4 (36...
e4 37. Qb8 e3 38. h4 {and mate follows}) 37. Ka3 {Now white's king is safe and
black's back rank is so weak. White's attack will be decisive.}) 34... Be6 $1
35. Qc6 {This is forced.} Bxb3+ 36. Kxb3 Rb8+ 37. Kc2 Rxb2+ {There we are,
white's advantage is all gone. I wonder if Anish had missed this move or he
just forgot about Be6.} 38. Kxb2 Qxd2+ 39. Kb3 Qxh2 40. Qd5 Qe2 41. Qxa5 Qd1+
42. Kb2 Qd2+ 43. Kb3 Qd1+ 44. Kb2 Qd2+ 45. Ka3 Qc1+ 46. Kb4 Qb1+ 47. Ka3 {
A good day for MVL, when his opening adventure went astray. Anish Giri had
only one bad move in this game, unfortunately, it was enough for MVL to make a
draw.} 1/2-1/2
