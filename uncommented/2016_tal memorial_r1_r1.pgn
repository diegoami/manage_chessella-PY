1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {Nepo has been using the Scotch lately,
including two victories against Chinese players in Danzhou and being held to a
draw by Brunello in the Olympiad. It must not have come as a surprise to
Tomashevsky.} Nf6 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. e5 Qe7 7. Qe2 Nd5 8. c4 Ba6 {Even though
this was played almost exclusively for some time, the move 8...Nb6 has become
more popular in recent years. Both should be perfectly playable for black.} 9.
b3 g6 10. f4 (10. g3 {is the other idea in the position and leads to entirely
different lines.}) 10... Bg7 $2 {Is this a mistake? It is the most popularm
ove, as it has been played over 200 times, and by a couple strong players. The
computers hate this move, and it has a very bad score on the database (61% for
White). Not only that, but all the top grandmasters choose something else 
(Kasparov chose f6, while Jakovenko chose g5). Perhaps it is this early that
we can point out where things started to go wrong for Tomashevsky.} 11. Qf2 Nf6
(11... Nb6 12. Ba3 Qe6 13. Nd2 $6 d6 14. O-O-O O-O 15. Ne4 dxe5 $1 {Gave Black
compensation for the exchange (though he eventually lost) in
Macieja-Kryvoruchko, 2012. That being said, White can improve on Nd2?!}) 12.
Ba3 (12. Be2 {also looks quite annoying for black.}) 12... d6 $6 (12... Ng4 $1
{is probably Black's best, as in Shabalov-Granda Zuniga from 2005.}) 13. Nc3 {
Already Black has huge problems. The threat of 0-0-0 with pressure on d6 is
not easy to handle.} O-O (13... Qe6 14. Be2 dxe5 15. O-O {looks extremely
risky. Black's king is completely stuck in the center.}) 14. O-O-O Ne8 15. g3 {
simple chess is strong. Notice that due to the pin on a3-e7, there is no way
that Black can break the bind in the center. The simple threat of Bg2 is hard
to parry already. Black doesn't have the luxury of playing c5 either.} Bb7 (
15... c5 16. Bg2 Rb8 17. Rhe1 {and e5 is still untouchable.}) (15... Qe6 16.
Bg2 Bb7 17. Rhe1 {is miserable.}) 16. Bg2 f6 17. exd6 $1 Nxd6 (17... cxd6 18.
Rhe1 Qd8 19. f5 $18 {is surprisingly less disastrous than the game.}) 18. c5 {
The knight has no good squares to go to.} Nf5 (18... Nb5 19. Nxb5 {is winning
due to the pin.}) (18... Nf7 19. Rhe1 {immediately traps the queen.}) (18...
Ne8 19. Rhe1 Qf7 20. Bf1 {is the same as the game.}) 19. Rhe1 Qf7 20. Bf1 {
The game is over. There is no way to prevent Bc4 - not only is it a pin, but
it just traps the queen on that square!} Rfd8 21. Rxd8+ Rxd8 22. Bc4 Rd5 23.
Qe2 {Black loses the exchange and his position is still bad. Absolutely
demolition.} 1-0

White has some problems down the d-file and with Ba3 coming.}) 18. Be3 d5 19.

that White truly has against the break in the center.} hxg5 20. Qxg5+ Ng6 21.

Black's king is a bit loose and his coordination has suffered because of it.}

kick the blockader from d7 and push the pawn, while Black has no real
counterplay.}) 31... Rde6 32. e4 Qc8 33. Rc2 Ne5 34. Qf5 Qb7 35. f4 {Perhaps
not a bad move, but very committal in a time trouble situation.} (35. h4 $1 $16

to make the position explode.} 38. Qe4 (38. Kh3 $1 {A crazy move to play in
time trouble, but the point is that after the forced} Nxd5 39. Rxd5 {Black
cannot play fxe5} fxe5 40. Rd7 {with Qf7+ winning. The Rh6+ does little after
Kg4.}) 38... Nxd5 39. Rxd5 fxe5 40. f5 Ra6 41. R1d2 $16 {Things are not so
