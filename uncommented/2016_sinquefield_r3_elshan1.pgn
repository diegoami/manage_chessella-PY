1. e4 {(3s)} c5 {(18s) Thanks to their victories in the second round, both players
seem to be in a fighting mood. A Najdorf is a perfect choice for the audience and
chess fans.} 2. Nf3 {(9s)} d6 {(3s)} 3. d4 {(7s) even better news! no sidelines with
Bb5+.} cxd4 {(8s)} 4. Nxd4 {(6s)} Nf6 {(4s)} 5. Nc3 {(7s)} a6 {5} 6. h3 {9 This move has
gained a lot of attention in recent years. Some of sicilian defence
theoretician would convincingly argue that this move may be even more
dangerous than English attack ( similiar to the game between Giri and MVL in
the first round).} e5 {5} 7. Nde2 $5 {9 The most common move. The idea of this
move is to play g4 and transfer the knight to g3, which will be an improvement
of knight's position compared to English attack when the d4 knight ends up on
unfavorable square of b3.} h5 {8 Again, the most common move. Nakamura
prevents g4.} 8. Nd5 $5 {7 An odd choice but not for Anand. He has
successfully employed this move against Topalov and MVL earlier this year.
Nakamura is surely prepared against this move.} (8. Bg5 {is the most common
move.} Be6 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. Nd5 Qd8 11. Qd3 g6 12. O-O-O Nd7 13. Kb1 Rc8 14.

MVL's and Topalov's path. His confident reaction (he only spends a bit of time)
shows that he is prepared to face 'Anand's rich opening arsenal'.} (9... Nd7
10. Nc3 Nf6 {here Anand employed two different moves against Topalov and MVL
and in both cases the two top super-GMs failed to solve all of their opening
problems. Although, one has to consider that these games were played in rapid
and blitz time control.} 11. Qd3 (11. Qd1 Be6 12. Bg5 Be7 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Be2
