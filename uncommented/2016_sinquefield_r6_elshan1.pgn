{After last year's bitter experience, Wesley So comes back to the Sinquefield Cup
with more experience and caution. In this game, he gradually takes down the
current leader Veselin Topalov.} 1. c4 {(4s)  It is not a surprise from So. He
sometimes goes 'English'.} e5 {(28s)} 2. g3 {(6s)} Nf6 {(56s)  After some
thought, Topalov decides to play it solid.} 3. Bg2 {(7s)} d5 {(8s)} 4. cxd5 {

(6s)} Be7 {(10s)  This continuation is known to be very solid and safe.
Nevertheless, we all know that Wesley managed to outplay Navara in the very
same opening, in a Karpovian manner, while suffering a loss against Carlsen in
the same fashion!} 8. d3 {(6s)} O-O {(52s)} 9. a3 {(4s)} Be6 {(82s) The most
common.} ({Carlsen chose a somewhat committal} 9... Re8 10. b4 Bf8 11. Bb2 Bg4

(58s)  Topa follows Navara's footsteps.} 11. Nxd5 {(7s)} Bxd5 {(7s)} 12. Qa4 {
(5s)  So deviates first before checking what Topalov had in mind to improve on
Navara's play. Although to be fair, there wasn't a whole lot to improve on!} (12. Rc1 Bd6

deviates but this time from Topalov's game. He got a somewhat easy draw
against the current world championship contender Sergey Karjakin in 2014.} (14.

that is just for them. The game has just started!} 16. Bxd4 {(6 s)} exd4 {(11s)
} 17. Qb3 {(4s)} Rb8 {(204s)} 18. e4 $1 {(6s) Played rather quickly, after just six seconds and it is either the result of So's great intuition or home preparation. In either case, White starts to pose some problems for Black.} dxe3 {(288s)} ({Computers prefer this move
over dxe3 but I woujld not have even considered it! I think this is the point where AI
passes us in deep thinking or ... maybe the engines are still be stupid! Unfortunately I suspect it is the former.} 18... c5) 19. fxe3 {(5s)} Rf8 {(422s)} 20. Ne4 {(232s)  White is active but Black has no weaknesses and he surely can cover the f7 square. Things seem far from dangerous for Black.} Qd7 {(385s)} 21. Rf3 {(87s)} Rbd8 $1 {(393s)  This is the right way to
equalize the game.} 22. d4 {(350s) Every move is key here as can be seen by the amount of time each player is spending. After the move played the knight on e4 no longer has an outpost.} c6 {(54s)} 23. Rcf1 {( 196s)} Qd5 {(124s)} 24. Qc2 {(584s)} g6 {(249s)} 25. g4 {(176s)  Forced, Otherwise Black would play f5 and White will start feeling uncomfortable.} Rde8 {(363s)} 26. h3 {(275s)} Bd8 {(110s)} 27. Nc3 {(74s)} Qe6 $6 {(265s)  The dubious mark is for the incorrect
change of mentality in Black's play. Topalov starts to play it safe and from
here things start to go wrong.} (27... Qc4 {followed by Bc7 is more active and
in fact Black is perfectly capable of fighting for the advantage at this point.}) 28.

White grab the pawn on c6?} 30. Qxc6 Qg5 31. Re1 Re6 32. Qc2 f5 33. Qc4 Rfe8 {
And surprisingly it is White who has to be cautious here. Nevertheless, it is
not easy to judge this position from that far!}) 30. dxc5 {(5s)} b5 {(15s)} 31.
Nc3 {(3s)} Qc6 {(28s)} 32. Qd2 {(635s)} Re5 $2 {(365s) Played after a considerable think, but what was wrong with just grabbing the pawn?} (32... Qxc5 33. Nd5 Qa7

problems for White.}) 34. Rd1 $1 {(233s)  Clever play by So.} Bxe3 $2 {(239s) 
Topalov falls for Wesley's trap. The game is practically over.} 35. Qd7 {(786s)

worry about.}) 35... Qa8 {(106s)} 36. Nd5 {(225s)} Bg5 {(222s)} 37. c6 {(12s)  The
end is close.} Bh4 {(498s)} 38. Rd2 {(523s)} Re1 {(313s)} 39. Rc2 {(559s)} Kg7
{(175s)} 40. Nb6 {( 0s)} Qb8 {(0s)} 41. Qd4+ {(184s)  After saving two games
back-to-back by posing several practical problems to his opponents, this time
Topalov falls victim of his own very talent: In an equal game, So started to
ask Topalov difficult questions after every move and after a while the Bulgarian either grew tired, or lost concentration as they approached the time control and failed to
maintain the balance. A great game to learn about practical decisions in chess.}
