{The biggest upset of the first round was Magnus Carlsen's draw against Nino
Batsiashvili. The World Champion, fresh from his exploits at the London Chess
Classic, was unable to get going against his Georgian opponent. Let's see how
the game went.} 1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 {This is Carlsen's way of saying
that he would like to have an original game without any theoretical
discussions.} c5 4. c4 d4 5. b4 $5 {Do you get what Carlsen is doing with the
white pieces? He is employing the Benko Gambit with reversed colours!} cxb4 6.
a3 b3 $5 {Benko is a decent opening with black. The black player gets decent
compensation. However, the problem with employing it with white is that you can
equalize the game but to get an advantage might not be so easy. Giving back the
pawn is a very common way to play against the Benko.} (6... bxa3 7. Bxa3 {would
be a full fledged Benko.}) 7. Qxb3 Nc6 8. O-O e5 {Nino has played natural moves
and has a good position out of the opening. A natural continuation would now be
d3, but Magnus wants to make use of his lead in development by opening up the
position.} 9. e3 Be7 10. exd4 exd4 (10... e4 $5 11. Ng5 Nxd4 12. Qb2 O-O 13.
Nxe4 Nxe4 14. Bxe4 Bf6 $17 {would give Black a clear advantage. But in an over
the board game it is not so easy to see this variation.}) 11. Bb2 O-O 12. Re1
Re8 13. a4 Na5 14. Qd3 Be6 15. Na3 Bxa3 $6 ( 15... Rc8 {Putting further
pressure on the c4 pawn would have given Black equal chances.}) 16. Bxa3 Bxc4
17. Qxd4 Qxd4 18. Nxd4 $14 {Magnus surely has a small edge now. This is due to
two factors: his pieces are better posted, and on an open board the bishops are
just too strong.} Bd5 19. Rxe8+ Rxe8 20. Rc1 b6 21. Bf1 Bb7 22. Nf5 {With
threats like Nd6 in the air, Black's position is getting quite hard to defend.
It is commendable that Batsiashvili could hold the position from this point
onwards, as Carlsen has a clear cut advantage.} Rd8 23. d4 Nd5 24. Bg2 g6 25.
Nd6 Ba8 26. h4 (26. Rc8 {would have won a pawn, but maybe Carlsen wanted more
from this position.} Rxc8 27. Nxc8 Bb7 28. Nxa7 Nc3 29. Bxb7 Nxb7 30. Nb5 Nxa4
31. Kf1 $16 {The knight on a4 is kind of trapped and the White king will slowly
proceed towards it. This would have given Carlsen excellent winning chances.})
26... h5 27. Re1 Bc6 28. Re5 Nf6 29. Rxa5 Bxg2 30. Rxa7 Bd5 {White still
maintains an edge in this position, but the opposite coloured bishops lend it
quite a drawish nature.} 31. Ra6 Nd7 32. Nb5 $2 {This throws away all the
advantage as it allows Black to activate her rook by threatening a mate.} (32.
Kf1 $16 {Getting the king to d3 would have left Black with unpleasant defensive
task ahead.}) 32... Re8 $1 33. Bb4 Re2 34. Ra7 Nf6 35. Kf1 Rb2 36. Bc3 Rc2 37.
Rc7 Ng4 {Black has tremendous activity and it is the World Champion who has to
play carefully now in spite of being a pawn up.} 38. Ke1 Rxf2 39. Rc8+ Kh7 40.
Rd8 Bf3 41. Re8 f6 42. Re7+ Kg8 43. Re8+ Kh7 44. Re7+ Kg8 45. Bd2 Rg2 46. Bf4
g5 $1 {Exchanging as many pawns as she can and getting closer to a draw.} 47.
hxg5 fxg5 48. Bxg5 Rxg3 49. Nc3 Bc6 50. Kd2 Rg2+ 51. Re2 Nf2 52. d5 Bxd5 $1 53.
Nxd5 Ne4+ 54. Ke3 Rxe2+ 55. Kxe2 Nxg5 56. Nxb6 Ne6 57. a5 Nc7 {It could be said
that the World Champion played quite well for a majority of the game. He had a
small edge and was pushing throught. However, allowing Re8 was quite a huge
inaccuracy which gave Nino the chance to activate her rook and secure the draw.
Full credit to the Georgian for playing a fine game to draw against an opponent
who is rated 336 points above her.} 1/2-1/2
