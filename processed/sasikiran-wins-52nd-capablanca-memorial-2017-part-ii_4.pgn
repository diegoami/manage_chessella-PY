Rfe1 Qc7 {I hadn't won a round-robin event since 2008. In 2011 I played in
Lublin and in 2011-12 in Delhi and then in 2015 in Danzhou. So I had played
some closed events before but never with any good results. So even though
Ivanchuk was half a point behind me, I took this draw, because it gave me a
share of the first place, at the very least. Also I had already gained 12 Elo
points from the event, which was nice.} 1/2-1/2
