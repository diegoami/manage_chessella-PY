O-O Be7 9. Nd2 O-O 10. Bxc6 $1 {This is the right choice when you are in a
must win scenario. You must imbalance the play.} bxc6 11. Qa4 Rb8 12. Nc4 Rb4
13. Qa5 f6 14. b3 Bh3 15. Re1 Qb8 16. Ba3 Rb5 $5 {MVL thought that this was
the right way to go because in return for the loss of exchange he gets the
initiative and the white queen looks a bit funny on a5.} 17. Nxb5 cxb5 18. Ne3
Qb7 19. f3 b4 $5 20. Bb2 Na6 {The threat is Bd8 followed by Bd7 trapping the
queen.} 21. g4 $1 {Grischuk prevents the bishop from coming out.} h5 22. a3 $5

gxf3 27. Kf2 fxe2 28. Kxe2 {White has an exchange for a pawn, but the pawns
are weak and it is not so easy to make progress.} Be6 29. Bc3 Bxb3 30. Rb1 Bf7

it clearly feels so, but MVL is a tricky guy!} g6+ 41. Kg5 Bc5 42. Kh6 Be3+ 43.

played this. While this move wins, what happened in the game was also winning,
albeit with more efforts.} Bf4 (44... Kf6 $2 45. Rf8+ Ke7 46. Rf1 $18) 45. Ra6

Be3 {At this point it seemed to us that the game might end in a draw. The
bishop sits on f2 and someone has to all the time baby sit the g2 square. But
there is still a way to win.} 48. Kg4 Bf2 49. Kf3 Kg6 50. Ra5 Kh6 51. Rb5 {
Grischuk makes some moves now that make no sense. He is just gaining time, and
soon hits on the right plan.} Kg6 52. Rd5 Kh6 53. Re5 Kg6 54. Rb5 Kh6 55. Rb4

Bf2 64. h4 $2 {The move that throws away the win. White had to get this same
position with black to play and he would have been able to make substantial
progress.} (64. Rg4 $1 Kh6 (64... Be1 65. Kg5 Bf2 66. Kh5 Be1 67. Re4 Bf2 68.

but there is just no win!} Be1 81. Re6 Bf2 82. h6 $1 {The final attempt and it
seemed as if White can win now as Kh8 is met with Re7. But MVL was very alert.}
Bc5 $1 (82... Kg8 83. Re7 $18) 83. Kxg3 Bf8 84. Kg4 Bxh6 85. Kf5 Bd2 {White is
just a tempo short of winning this rook vs bishop endgame.} 86. Kf6 (86. Rg6
