1. c4 f5 2. b3 d6 3. Bb2 e5 4. d4 {Reinforcing the truism that when trying to
'convert a rating advantage' the best way is to fianchetto and bring about
interesting, even if not immediately advantageous, positions. There is really
not much I can plausibly say about this opening!} Qe7 (4... e4 {was another
call Black could take, trying to play with a far-advanced centre (...Nf6, ...
c6, ...d5, then have a think.)} 5. e3 c6 6. Nh3 Nf6 7. d5 $132) (4... Nd7 {

and unstereotyped opportunity that Black could have taken; now only he can be
better, but on the other hand, it takes good concentration, or silicon
assistance, to verify that} 10. e4 $5 Nxe4 11. Nd5 Nc3+ $1 12. Nxe7 Nxd1 13.

hurriedly offered a draw with} 33. Re1 {.} (33. Re1 Qxe7 34. Qxh5 Qe6 35. Qc5 {
is equal but arguably easier for Black to play. However, with no idea of the
time situation or the mental capacity of Black to play for a win against
someone 300 points higher, it is hard to criticise accepting the draw.})

1. Nf3 g6 {It is often interesting to see what Kamsky (and, to an even greater
extent, Nakamura) plays in early rounds of opens! Here it is a slightly
offbeat Modern.} 2. e4 Bg7 3. d4 d6 4. c3 Nf6 5. Bd3 O-O 6. O-O Nc6 (6... c5 {

Kh8 15. Rad1 f5 {So both sides have completed development and the ball is in
White's court regarding how he will react to Black's pawn push. Obviously, if
he had a few tempi he could vacuum off the major pieces and that would be that.

exf4 20. Rxd8 Qxd8 21. Bxf4 Nxf4 22. Qxf4 Qe7 {Black seems to have done
everything right-opening the position for the bishop pair, using the tactical
tension on the e-file, keeping the a3-knight sidelined- but concretely, there
is little that can be done to prevent White resolving these issues.} 23. Kf2
