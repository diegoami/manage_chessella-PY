{Another technical game, like the last, featuring my 'hero' of round 1 and
also featuring a nice technical rook endgame, interestingly again with White
having an extra b-pawn...} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 c6
6. e3 h6 (6... Bf5 7. Qf3 Bg6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Qxf6 gxf6 10. Nf3 Nd7 11. Nh4 Be7
12. Ne2 {was the 'modern classic' Carlsen,M-Kramnik,V, Stavanger 2016}) 7. Bh4
Bf5 {The implication of ...Bf5 from Black in these positions is generally that
he is fine to play for a draw.} 8. Bd3 (8. Qf3 {would be similar to the last
note, with a minor wrinkle being that the bishop has h7 too.}) 8... Bxd3 9.
Qxd3 Be7 10. Nge2 O-O 11. f3 {We have swiftly left theoretical battlefields.
White may not be claiming any advantage as such, but he is asking a very
powerful question- with e4 unstoppable, does Black generate counterplay before
he gets overrun?} Re8 12. O-O Nbd7 13. Rad1 (13. Bf2 $5 {White could maybe
dispense with Rad1, since the rook might want to come to e1 instead later.} b5
14. Ng3) 13... b5 14. Bf2 Bf8 15. Ng3 Rc8 $6 {Doesn't give a particularly
coherent impression.} (15... h5 $5 {was a good example of drastic action Black
should have considered.}) (15... b4 16. Nce2 c5 {could have been played
immediately since that was what Black did next anyway}) 16. h3 (16. e4 $5 {
screamed out to be played. Obviously, the issue White had with this must have
been} dxe4 17. fxe4 Ng4 {else he would not have bothered playing 16.h3,
however here} 18. Qf3 $1 $14 {gives White an edge}) 16... b4 17. Nce2 c5 $1 {
Action at last.} 18. dxc5 Bxc5 19. Nf4 Qb6 {Forcing Nf5, which White likely
wanted anyway.} (19... Qa5 $1 20. Nf5 (20. Nxd5 Qxa2 21. Nxf6+ Nxf6 $11) 20...
Qxa2 {It turns out White's play is not yet so serious that Black can't go
pawn-grabbing.}) 20. Nf5 Ne5 21. Qb3 g6 (21... Nc4 $5 {must have been
considered; it seems} 22. Nxd5 Nxd5 23. Rxd5 Bxe3 (23... Nxe3 24. Rxc5 $1 {
wins on the spot.}) 24. Nxe3 Rxe3 $3 $14 {may have been the missed detail;
Black obtains a fair amount of counterplay}) 22. Nxh6+ Kg7 23. Ng4 {Picking up
a clean pawn.} Nexg4 24. fxg4 Bxe3 25. Nxd5 Nxd5 26. Qxd5 Re7 (26... Rcd8 27.
Qf3 Rxd1 28. Rxd1 Re5 {may have been a slightly better try, looking for Ra5
after the pieces come off, but after} 29. b3 $16 {a pawn is still a pawn.}) 27.
Qf3 Bxf2+ 28. Qxf2 Rc2 29. Qxb6 axb6 30. Rf2 Ree2 31. Rxe2 Rxe2 32. b3 $1 {
A very cute detail. Now, by virtue of his rook position on b4, White's pawn
plus is exceptionally relevant, and the position may already be technically
winning. This is a difficult endgame to annotate- if Black was not already
lost, where did he lose?} Rxa2 33. Rd4 Re2 34. Rxb4 Re6 35. Kf2 g5 {An
interesting call. It's not clear to me that this actually needed to be done,
though its idea- preventing White's g5- is clear.} (35... f6 36. h4 Kh6 37. Rb5
Rc6 {The idea is that g5 can always be met by a capture and Kh5, and that h5
can always be ignored. This is an alternative setup, and the way to try and
break it down is obvious.} 38. Kg3 Rd6 39. Kh3 Rc6 40. g3 {Maybe this forces ..
.g5.} Rd6 (40... Kg7 41. Rd5 Rc3 42. Rd7+ Kh6 43. Rf7 $1 $18) 41. g5+ fxg5 42.
Rxg5 $16 {White has undoubled and the maneouvring can continue.}) 36. Rb5 f6
37. g3 Kg6 38. h4 Kh6 39. Kf3 Kg6 40. Rd5 Rc6 41. Ke4 Re6+ 42. Kd3 Re1 (42...
gxh4 43. gxh4 Re1 {It seems critical, as in the last line, to permit the
undoubling. Maybe this would have drawn. Maybe I would criticise it if it was
played en route to a loss...}) 43. hxg5 (43. h5+ Kh6 44. Rf5 Kg7 45. Rf3 {
could have been another idea- Black has no way to hit the pawns, and must go
back to defence, but White has improved his king to the 4th rank.}) 43... Rg1
$5 {An imaginative defence- reminding us that chess is a game of 2 players-
but unfortunately he is already dead.} 44. gxf6 Rxg3+ 45. Kc4 $18 (45. Kd4 $5
Rxg4+ 46. Ke5 {may have been better.}) 45... Rxg4+ 46. Kb5 Kxf6 47. Kxb6 Rb4+
48. Rb5 Re4 49. b4 Ke6 50. Kb7 Kd6 51. Rb6+ Kd5 (51... Kd7 52. b5 Rb4 53. Ka7
Ra4+ 54. Ra6 Rb4 55. b6 Kc8 56. Ra1) 52. Ka6 {The only winning move, but
obvious enough. The rest has been seen a hundred times; Black is cut off, this
time not on the files but on the ranks.} Rh4 53. Rb7 Rh6+ 54. Ka5 Rh1 55. b5
Kd6 56. Rg7 Kc5 57. Rc7+ Kd6 58. b6 Ra1+ 59. Kb5 Ra8 60. Rc1 1-0
