Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 $5 {Abhijeet Gupta is a connosseiur of the Saemisch Variation in the King's Indian. He does play the h3 Variation (11 games in the Mega with nine wins for Abhijeet) but just not as often.} O-O 6. h3 e5 7. d5 Nh5 8. g3 {The longterm trumps of space and free development of pieces lie with White. Black on the other hand has castled and is ahead in development. He must open the position as soon as he can.} f5 9. exf5 gxf5 10. Nh4 {After following Tomashevsky's idea of Nd2 in his game against Ankit Rajpara, Abhijeet follows the Russian Champion's footsteps once again. But it looks more of a coincidence than something that was preplanned.} (10. Nxe5 $2 Qe8 $1 $19) (10. Ng5 {is an alternate line.} Qe8 11. Be2 Nf6 12. Be3 {is another way to play this position.}) 10... Qe8 11. Be2 Nf6 12. Bg5 { What exactly is the role of the bishop on g5? It probes the kingside – in a way tempting Black to play h6, when the light squares around his king would be further weakened.} Na6 (12... h6 13. Be3 $1 $16 {The g6 square has been weakened and Qd2 will attack the h6 pawn. Provoking h6 was good for White.}) 13. Qc2 Nb4 14. Qd2 a5 15. a3 Na6 16. Qc2 Nc5 17. Be3 (17. Nxf5 $2 Bxf5 18. Qxf5 Nfe4 $19) 17... e4 (17... Bd7 $5 18. Bxc5 dxc5 19. Nxf5 Bxf5 20. Qxf5 Nxd5 21. Qe4 Nxc3 22. bxc3 Rd8 23. O-O {White maintains an edge here because of his safer king position and his bishop can be more active on e4 later. But I can hardly imagine him to be seriously better.}) 18. O-O-O Nfd7 19. Kb1 Ra6 20. Nb5 {Both sides have their share of weaknesses, but it seems that the holes in Black's position are much more. The knights are coming to d4 and f4 to get to the e6 square.} Qd8 21. Ng2 c6 22. Nd4 Ne5 23. Nf4 {[%csl Gc5,Gd4,Ge5,Gf4] A unique position with all the knights well placed on central posts. As Abhijeet said after the game, he had a similar position on his laptop before the game. Just goes to show the high level of preparation that this guy indulges in.} Bd7 24. g4 $1 {Extremely alert and excellently played!} cxd5 (24... fxg4 25. hxg4 { with the threat of Nde6 – this looks extremely strong.}) 25. cxd5 (25. Nxf5 { was stronger as after} Ba4 26. Qd2 Ned3 (26... Bxd1 27. Qxd5+ Kh8 28. Rxd1 $18) 27. Nxg7 Kxg7 28. Nxd3 exd3 29. Bxd3 $18 {White is winning.}) 25... Ba4 26. Qd2 Ncd3 (26... Bxd1 27. Rxd1 $16 {The rooks don't really matter in this position. It's the knights and bishops that can cause maximum damage here.}) 27. Bxd3 exd3 28. Rc1 Rb6 29. Nfe6 Qf6 30. Nxg7 f4 31. Nh5 Qg6 32. Nxf4 Qe4 33. f3 Bc2+ 34. Ka1 {A wonderful strategic game by Abhijeet. He was able to outplay his experienced opponent in a tense complicated middlegame, something which is not easy when the person sitting opposite you is Alexander Shabalov.} 1-0
