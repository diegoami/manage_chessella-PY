        e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb4+ 5. Bd2 Be7 6. Nc3 Bb7 7. Bg2 c6 8. e4 { The players 
        are following the game Anand-Carlsen from their World Championship Match 
        in 2014. Sergei Tiviakov in his video on CBM 168 mentions that if White 
        wants to fight for an advantage he must refrain from the move 8.e4 and 
        instead go for castling. As things went in this game, we cannot really 
        argue with what Tiviakov says.} d5 9. exd5 cxd5 10. Ne5 O-O 11. O-O Nc6 
        12. cxd5 Nxe5 $1 { Of course the line that Black is walking is quite narrow. 
        He has to make all the accurate moves in order to equalize. But you can 
        be rest assured that a player of Eljanov's calibre has it all worked out 
        at home.} 13. d6 Nc6 14. dxe7 Qxe7 15. Bg5 h6 16. d5 Na5 17. d6 {This 
        is the first move where the game deviates from the Anand-Carlsen World 
        Championship Match. Vishy had taken on f6. Vidit comes up with this natural 
        move, but now it is open for debate whether the pawn on d6 is a strength 
        or a weakness.} (17. Bxf6 Qxf6 18. dxe6 Bxg2 $1 19. exf7+ Qxf7 20. Kxg2 
        Nc4 21. Qb3 Rad8 $11 {And with some further analysis it has been proved 
        that Black is equal in this position.}) 17... Qd8 18. Bxf6 Qxf6 19. Qe2

        {Vidit could have settled for a draw here with Rd4 but instead he went 
        for something more ambitious. Not that the position warrants it, but his 
        age definitely does!} 25. g4 $5 {I would say after this move, all three 
        results are possible. White tries to play acctively but at the sam time 
        weakens his own king. Objectively this is not a great move.} Rfd8 26.

        for Eljanov.} 38. b3 Rd3 39. Nb5 Ne3+ 40. Kf2 Nd1+ 41. Ke1 Nc3 42. Nxc3
