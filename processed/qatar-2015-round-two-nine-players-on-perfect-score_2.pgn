1. e4 {Aravindh
is famed in the Indian chess circuits for his unorthodox openings. But
against the World Champion he decides to play it safe with 1.e4.} c5 2.
b3 $5 {Well, so much for the well trodden paths! The 16-year-old had beaten
Alexei Shirov with 1.b3 a year ago. This time he tries to catch a bigger
fish with that move but 1.e4 c5 2.b3 is much different than 1.b3.} g6
$5 {After the game in an interview Carlsen said that he had considered
playing this line with White but did not like this 2...g6 move. And hence
he tried it. This is the same line recommended by Peter Heine Nielsen
in his book Experts against the Anti-Sicilians.} 3. Bb2 Nf6 4. e5 Nd5
{Here Aravindh sank into a deep thought. He was of course out of theory
and wanted to clarify the position as much as he could. There is a chance
that the e5 pawn would become weak and hence he decides to advance the
pawn.} 5. e6 $6 (5. d4 Qa5+ 6. Qd2 Qxd2+ 7. Nxd2 cxd4 8. Ngf3 Bg7 $11
{might be a better way for White to play, but I think Black has absolutely
no problems in this position as well.}) 5... f6 $1 6. exd7+ Qxd7 {The
e-pawn made four moves and exchanged itself for the d7 pawn which hadn't
moved even once in the game.} 7. Nc3 Nc6 8. Bb5 Nc7 9. Bxc6 Qxc6 $15 {Black
already has a bishop pair and the possibility to establish a strong center
with e5. He is clearly better. One would assume that the World Champion
would win quite easily from this point onwards. But Aravindh doesn't give
up easily.} 10. Qf3 Bd7 11. O-O-O e5 12. Qxc6 Bxc6 13. f3 Ne6 14. Nge2
Be7 15. Rhf1 b5 16. Rde1 Kf7 17. Nd1 a5 {Things are going excellently
for Black as he slowly but steadily builds up his position. White has
nothing much that he can do than to wait and hope for the opponent to
go wrong.} 18. Ne3 Bd6 $6 {The problem with this move is that the bishop
is a little exposed on d6 and can be hit with the move Nc4 or Ne4.} (18...
Rhe8 { was much better.}) 19. Nc3 h5 $6 (19... a4 {was necessary to stop
White from going a4.}) 20. a4 $1 {Securing the c4 square for the knight.}
b4 21. Ne4 Bc7 22. Nc4 {Suddenly things are not at all clear. White has
an excellent square for his knight on c4 and the Black pawns, which were
once very strong, now look like targets.} h4 23. g4 hxg3 24. hxg3 Rh3
25. g4 {[%cal Rg4g5] [#]} (25. f4 $5 {Trying to open the position could
have been a possible option.} exf4 26. gxf4 Bxe4 27. Rxe4 $13) 25... Rd8
$2 {A gross miscalculation by the World Champion. If one were to ask what
is it that White threatens here, it is easy to see that the move is g4-g5.
Carlsen overlooks that and allows White to gain the advantage.} (25...
g5 $1 $17) 26. g5 $1 Bxe4 (26... f5 27. Bxe5 $1 $18) 27. fxe4 Nf4 (27...
Nxg5 28. Bxe5 Bxe5 29. Nxe5+ Kg7 30. Nc4 $14 {is surely a slight edge
for White.}) 28. gxf6 $1 Ke6 29. Ne3 (29. d3 g5 30. f7 Rf8 31. Rg1 Kf6
32. Kd1 Rxf7 33. Bc1 Rg7 34. Rg4 Rh4 35. Ne3 $14 {was a possible way to
continue the game when White has a pleasant position thanks to the more
compact pawn structure.}) 29... g5 30. Nd5 (30. d3 $14) 30... Bd6 31.
Rg1 Rg8 32. Rg4 Rh4 33. Rgg1 g4 34. Ne3 g3 {The position has changed a
bit in the last few moves and White has lost his edge.} 35. Nf5 Rhh8 $1
(35... Rh3 36. f7 Kxf7 37. Nxd6+ $18) 36. f7 (36. Nxg3 Rh3 $1 $19) (36.
f7 Rg4 $1 {and the rook on h8 controls the f8 square.}) 36... Rg6 37.
Kd1 g2 {And here Aravindh's flag fell. Most probably the position is already
lost as Nh3 winning an exchange is coming up. An interesting game where
Magnus was once again put under some strong pressure by his 300 points
lower rated opponent.} 0-1
