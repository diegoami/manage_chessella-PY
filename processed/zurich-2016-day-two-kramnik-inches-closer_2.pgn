Rc3 Kf7 22. Bf4 Rd8 {Not your usual Berlin, but you see all the typical things:
White has more pawns on the kingside, Black has the pair of bishops. This
particular version looks pretty bad for White: his pawn on f5 is weak, h4
controls the remaining kingside and it's hard to even make a move.} 23. Bxe5

hanging}) 25... Bxh4 26. g4 Ke7 27. gxf5 Rd4 28. Nc5 Rd2 {White's second rank
is too weak now} 29. Kh1 (29. Rd3 Rg5+ 30. Kh1 Rgg2 $17) 29... Rxb2 30. Rd3 Bf6
31. Ne4 Rh4 {White has nothing to show for his material deficit and more pawns
are about to fall on the queenside.} 32. Re3 Rxa2 33. Rb1 b6 34. Rbe1 Rc2 35.
c5 b5 36. Ra3 Rf4 37. Rxa6 Bh4 38. f6+ Kf7 {The rook on e1 is overloaded
defending the mate on f1 and the knight on e4. Game over.} 0-1
