{A proper tournament overview cannot neglect this very first game. In a
'normal' Open, such an encounter can be seen only in the final rounds but the
chess.com Isle of Man International is not just one of the many. Besides being
the strongest open tournament ever where tough games is the everyday feature,
it also introduced the new random pairings of which the reader is surely aware.
Therefore... The opening and middlegame phases we can leave that to the
technicians. What I find very interesting is how the endgame went and how
precisely could have Kramnik clinched a draw.} 38... hxg5 {The game
continuation proved that} (38... Kh7 {was more precise} 39. Qxd5 Rxd5 {[%csl
Rh4] keeping the h-pawns on the board. The h4 white pawn becomes a clear
target and will give Black later on the needed counterplay.}) 39. hxg5 Kh7 40.
Qxd5 Rxd5 41. f4 Kg6 {Everyone knows that bringing your king to the center,
using it as a very strong piece, is one of the ABC of endgame theory. However,
in this particular case} (41... Rd3 $1 {would have most probably secured Black
half a point. The rook is now active, keeps an eye on the e3-weakness and
prevents the white king from stepping easily into play.} 42. Kb1 ({If} 42. Re5
{then} Kg6 43. Kb1 a4 44. Kc2 Rb3 45. Re4 Kf5 {where I don't see what White
could try here.}) 42... Kg6 43. Kc2 Rd7 44. Rd4 {compared to the game, Black
now has} Re7 45. Kd3 Rb7 {with sufficient counterplay for a draw.}) 42. Rd4 $1
{In the line given above, not only had White lost a lot of tempi to bring the
king to a less favourable position, but also the black rook could attack the
e3 pawn. Not anymore.} Rb5 43. Ka3 Kf5 44. b3 f6 $2 {The commentators believe
a draw could still have been achieved later on but I have serious doubts. I
believe this was the final error. An understandable move, as theory suggests
to exchange your weaknesses, thus minimizing your opponent's advantage. But
here it backfired.} ({A tough and effective defense can be achieved with} 44...
Rb7 45. Ka4 ({If} 45. Ra4 Rb5) 45... Kg4 {and it is actually those pawns that
are still left on the board which bring Black the hopes back.}) 45. Ka4 Rb7 46.
Rc4 Ra7 47. Rc5+ Ke4 48. Rxa5 Re7 ({Other sources give} 48... Rf7 {as the
drawing alternative but after} 49. gxf6 ({Not} 49. g6 {as analyzed before,
where Black does indeed hold.} Rb7 50. f5 Kxe3 51. Rc5 Kd4 52. b4 Rb8 53. Kb3
Rb7 54. Rc1 Ke5 55. Rf1 Rb8 $11) 49... gxf6 50. f5 Kxe3 51. b4 Kd4 52. Kb5 Rb7+

50. Ra6 Kf5 51. Rd6 Ra7+ 52. Kb5 Rb7+ 53. Kc4 Rc7+ 54. Kd4 Rb7 55. e4+ Kxf4 56.
Rxf6+ {White won after a couple of moves. I should perhaps re-emphasize how
important the first round and its consequences are for someone's tournament
route. Rhythm and entering the 'zone' should not be underestimated, not even
by Gods like Kramnik and Caruana. After losing in the first round, Kramnik had
to win at all costs and against lower rated players, had to take risks and
load the dice at times...he did come back in the tournament, but at a price.}
