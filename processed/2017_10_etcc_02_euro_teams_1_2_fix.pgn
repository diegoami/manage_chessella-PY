{As the round 1 'game of the day' I have to pick, without a doubt (!) ...this
thrilling battle of wits, even though it did not involve any of the absolute
top seeded teams or players.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 d5 5. cxd5

Dziuba,M (2556)-Ipatov,A (2494) Moscow 2009. Israeli GM Boris Avrukh considers
here that White has to scrape the barrel to find compensation, and I do not
see a reason to disagree.}) 8. Be2 {Of course, there are heaps of moves here;
alternatives are Be3 and Rb1, among others, and I'm not keen to go into more
irrelevant theory. Trust me, there is a lot more interesting stuff later; and
suffice it to say that after 7...0-0 White is well suited by this move, with
its aim of castling quickly.} c5 9. O-O b6 $5 {Probably best.} (9... Nc6 {

implementation of Black's opening concept, and one which leaves open the
option of avoiding Bh6 trades. Of course, the downside is that White can play}

attacked brilliantly so far, decided that now was the time for material gain.

suddenly doubles Black's problems.} Ne7 30. Qxh5 Qc2 31. Rb4 b6 32. axb6 axb6

an ending, but it is totally unenviable.} 37. Rxb6 Nf5 38. Rxe6 $3 {A key
