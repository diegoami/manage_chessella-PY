In this position he could take on c6 but then the position would just be equal. Instead he plays in the romantic style and gives up his central pawns.} 12. Nc3 $5 Qxd4 13. Be3 Qxe5 14. Bc5 {Even though objectively Black is fine and maybe even slightly better, it is extrmely difficult to find the right path in the rapid format.} a6 15. Rfe1 Qg5 16. Bxc6+ Rxc6 17. Rad1 Ne7 {Black has played excellently. Not only is he two pawns up but he is all ready to 0-0 his king to safety.} 18. Qb4 a5 $2 (18... Rxc5 19. Qxc5 O-O $17 {would have been a very favourable position for Black.}) 19. Qxb7 $1 {So did White blunder his bishop on c5?} Rxc5 {[#]} 20. Ne4 $1 {Of course Nepomniachtchi had seen this cute trick!} Qh4 (20... dxe4 21. Qd7+ Kf8 22. Qd8#) 21. g3 Qxh3 22. Nxc5 {Black cannot even 0-0 and is completely lost.} Nf5 23. Qd7+ {With this win Nepomniachtchi takes the sole second position.} 1-0
