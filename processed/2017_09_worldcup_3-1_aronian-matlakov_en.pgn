1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e3 $5 {Levon is quite dangerous with
positions where the pawn structures are flexible and this opening is one of
them.} Bb4 5. Qc2 Bxc3 6. bxc3 (6. Qxc3 {would be the main move. Why else
would you play your queen to c2? Well, Levon thinks it is well placed, and
decides to bolster his centre.}) 6... O-O 7. d3 d6 (7... e4 $5 {I find this
pawn sacrifice to be quite interesting.} 8. dxe4 d6 {And these pawn weaknesses
would compensate for the missing pawn.}) 8. Be2 Re8 9. e4 Ne7 10. Nh4 $5 {
I find this and Levon's next move to be very interesting.} Ng6 11. Nxg6 $1 ({
Usually you want to make a move like this, but here it just doesn't work.} 11.
Nf5 Bxf5 12. exf5 Nh4 13. g3 (13. g4 e4 $1 $17) 13... Nxf5 $15) 11... hxg6 12.
O-O {Essentially what Levon did was to exchange his f3 knight for Black's c6
knight. Now f4 is White's next idea.} c6 13. f4 b5 $5 14. cxb5 cxb5 15. h3 {
Levon would like to park his king on h2.} Qb6+ 16. Kh2 Be6 17. a4 {This is
typical Aronian. He starts his play on the kingside and then follows it up with
queenside play â€” playing on both the wings.} a6 18. Qb2 Nd7 19. Rb1 Rab8 20.
axb5 axb5 21. Rf3 {Preparing Be3, as well as putting the rook on g3 after f5.}
f6 22. f5 gxf5 23. exf5 Bd5 24. Rg3 Re7 (24... Qf2 25. Be3 Qxf5 26. Bg4 $18)
25. Bh5 e4 26. d4 Bc4 27. Bf4 {White's two bishops are excellently placed.} Ra8
28. Ra1 {Snatching the a-file away from the opponent.} Rd8 29. Ra3 {Doubling
on the a-file.} Nf8 30. Qa1 Bf7 31. Ra6 Qc7 32. Be2 $1 {Keeping the pressure
and attacking the b5 pawn.} Bc4 33. Bxc4+ Qxc4 34. Rxd6 $18 {Levon has won a
pawn and the rest is just a matter of technique for a player like him.} Nd7 (
34... Rc8 35. Rxf6 $18) 35. Qa7 Kf7 36. Qb7 Ke8 37. Re6 Rxe6 38. fxe6 Qxe6 39.
Rxg7 e3 40. Qf3 {A check from h5 is going to be terminal. A game which is so
difficult to explain, but so very well played by Aronian.} 1-0
