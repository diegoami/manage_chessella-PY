1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c6 4. e3 ({Kazhgaleyev has also employed the
continuation} 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Qc2 $5 {several times here. In fact I myself
tested this same line two rounds later in my match against Kramnik and
obtained a very promising position after the opening.}) {[#]} 4... Nf6 {
Now we enter the field of the Meran Variation of the Slav Defence.} ({Instead,
a game of mine against Carlsen proceeded in the following fashion:} 4... Bd6 5.
Bd3 f5 6. Qc2 Nf6 7. Nge2 O-O 8. f3 Kh8 9. Bd2 a6 $6 10. c5 $1 {and White won
in 61 moves, M.Carlsen 2770 – V.Ivanchuk 2746, Leon 2009.}) 5. Nf3 (5. Bd2 g6

Memorial earlier this year. There followed} 8. O-O O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. Rfe1 a6
11. Rad1 b5 12. cxd5 exd5 13. e4 b4 14. e5 bxc3 15. exf6 {½-½ V.Ivanchuk

approach.}) 9. Bd3 ({Upon} 9. Be2 {I was ready to proceed} b6 ({Also} 9... dxc4

nowadays.}) 9... Qe7 {[#]} 10. Rd1 {This is a logical waiting move.} ({Upon} 
10. O-O {Black can comfortably break in the center with} e5 11. dxe5 (11. cxd5
$6 {is rather risky for White, but the reply} e4 12. Nxe4 Nxe4 13. dxc6 {
, etc. needs more practical trials.}) 11... Nxe5 12. Nxe5 Qxe5 13. g3 dxc4 {
thereby solving any problems in the opening.}) 10... h6 {Black waits too...} ({
...although it was worth considering} 10... e5 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Nxe5 (12. cxd5
$5) 12... Bxe5 13. cxd5 Bg4 $5) ({or even} 10... b6 11. O-O Bb7) 11. h3 ({

develop the queenside by} 11... b6 {[%cal Gc8b7]}) {[#]} 12. Bxc4 $1 {White
was practically forced to recapture with the bishop...} ({...since upon} 12.
bxc4 e5 {[#] Black has excellent play.} {White's direct attempt} 13. Nh4 $5 ({
Although perhaps it is worth trying the idea of} 13. Bf5 $5 exd4 14. Nxd4 Ba3
15. Ba1 $1 Nb6 {with an unclear game. Despite having a weak pawn on c4, White
hopes to create threats by invading with the knight on f5.}) {is probably met
most simply by} 13... Nf8 $1 {,} ({although there is the very interesting idea
of} 13... exd4 14. Nf5 Qf8 ({or} 14... Qe5) 15. Nxd6 Qxd6 16. Be2 $1 Rxe3 $5
17. fxe3 Qg3+ 18. Kf1 dxc3 19. Bxc3 Qxe3 {leading to a complicated position in
which Black has his chances.})) 12... e5 {[#]} ({Here it is already a matter
of taste since} 12... b5 {followed by ...Bb7 looks fully acceptable for Black.}

Nh4 $1 Nf8 (13... Nb6 14. Ng6 Qc7 15. Nxe5 {is in White's favor.}) ({while} 
13... e4 $2 14. Nf5 Qf8 15. Nxd6 Qxd6 16. d5 {is quite unpleasant for Black.})

me...}) ({...but not} 14. dxe5 $1 Bxe5 15. O-O Bc7 16. Nf5 Qe5 17. Ng3 Qg5 18.

anything better than that.}) ({It was also possible to simplify the position
by means of} 13. dxe5 Nxe5 14. Nxe5 ({or} 14. Be2 $5) 14... Bxe5 15. O-O Bc7
16. Rfe1 Qe5 17. f4 ({A slight initiative might be felt for Black after} 17. g3

bishop from exchange by} 15... Bc7) 16. g4 $6 {Now White decided to play very
aggressively.} ({After} 16. Nxd6 Qxd6 17. O-O Nfd5 18. Qc1 Qg6 19. Kh2 Rad8 {
Black would have been able to gradually prepare an attack on the kingside.})
16... Bh7 {I didn't want to allow any further attacks on this bishop, so I
rejected the retreat to g6 because of a possible Nc4-e5 with gain of tempo.}

} 19... Nxc3 20. Bxc3 Nxc4 21. bxc4 Qxg5 22. Kd2 {but I absolutely didn't want
to improve my opponent's pawn structure.} ({or first} 22. c5 {[%cal Ge1d2] and
only then 23.Kd2.})) ({It would however have been very logical to go} 19... Bg6
$1 {preventing my rival from improving his pawn structure on the next move.}) {
The threat of 20.Rxh7 Kxh7, 21.Nxe4 is now eliminated and I am just
threatening to pick off the pawn on g5.} 20. Rg1 $2 {The rook abandons the
h-file which means the total collapse of White's strategy.} ({It was necessary
to exploit some helpful tactics -} 20. f4 $1 Bf5 (20... Nxc4 21. Bxc4 $1 Nxe3

hopeless since he is unable to defend the pawn on f2 or create any threats
along the h-file.} 30. Kb1 Rf6 31. f4 exf3 32. Bd3 f2 33. Rhf1 Rxe3 34. Kb2 Qf3
