Be3 {(00:24)} h6 {(01:07) While this might still be described as theory per the databases, this setup of the Modern Defence is very flexible, and unlikely to have been any specific preparation. The growing amount of time spent by both players in the following moves corroborates this.} 10. h4 { (04:34)} f5 $2 {(11:24) A pretty strange choice in view of the bishop on c4, now pressuring the e6 pawn for free. Why not continue Black's development with Bb7, Nd7, or even Nc6 as the engine seems to like?} 11. exf5 {(06:28)} Nxf5 { (01:45)} 12. g3 {(02:41)} Kh7 {(10:00)} 13. Bd3 {( 06:04)} Kh8 {(07:08)} 14.

White decides to take advantage of Black's refusal to develop her pieces and strikes first. It must have come as a great shock to the former World Women Champion.} exd5 {(04:07)} 19. Qxd5 {(02:41)} Ra7 {( 16:07)} 20. g4 {(06:09)} Bb7 {(11:27)} 21. Qe6 $6 {(06:59) An imprecision that could have cost the initiative, but she will not be punished today.} Rf3 {(00:05)} 22. Qxg6 {(02:44)} Rh3 {(00:50)} 23. f4 {(00:45) The engines actually claim this is equal, but that huge pawnroller in front of Black's king just looks like trouble. I know which side I would prefer to be playing here.} Nc6 {(06:57)} 24. f5 {(05:29)} Rxh4 {(00:23) The problem is that while it does gain back a pawn, it is an unimportant one at the moment, and allows White to gain precious tempi she will can put to good use.} 25. Kf2 {(02:17)} Qg7 $4 { (03:06) Black wants to alleviate the pressure she is under by exchanging the queens, but overlooks the disastrous consequences.} (25... Ra8 {was preferable, bringing the rook into play and to the king's defense.}) 26. Qxg7+ {(01:42)} Kxg7 {(00:01)} 27. Kg3 {(00:09)} Nxe5 {(00:49)} 28. Kxh4 {(00:31)} Nf3+ { (00:04)} 29.
