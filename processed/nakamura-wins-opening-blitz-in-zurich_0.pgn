Nd5 16. Bb3 $16 {White's position is already very comfortable. He has pressure
all around the board, including the a-file, some tricks on the kingside and
Black's pieces need to keep constant protection over squares such as c5.} Rad8
17. axb5 axb5 18. Bxh6 $1 {A very nice trick. It doesn't win a pawn, but it
gives White a great position.} Nxc3 (18... gxh6 19. Bxd5 {and the bishop is
taboo due to Nf6+.} Bg7 20. Bb3 Qxd3 21. Qc1 $1 {Looks almost winning for
White.}) 19. Nxc3 gxh6 20. Ne4 Be7 (20... Bg7 21. Nc5 {also looks annoying.})

collapses.} Qg5 25. Nxf7 Qg6 26. Nxd8 Bxd8 27. Rxe8 1-0
