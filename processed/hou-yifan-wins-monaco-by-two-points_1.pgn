In the recently published book by Quality Chess, Python Strategy which deals with Tigran Petrosian's best games, this game has been annotated by Vladimir Simagin. This is what Simagin has to say about the move, " A routine move would have been 9.Rb1. Petrosian exchanges his knight with a concrete plan in view. It consists in playing for the good minor piece which is what White's other active knight will later prove t be - as opposed to Black's passive dark squared bishop.} Qxf6 10. Nd2 $1 {[%cal Gd2e4,Ge4c3] Just like Hou Yifan did, the knight is going from d2-e4-c3 in order to clamp down the d5 square.} d6 11. Ne4 Qd8 12. Nc3 {We could just as well stop here with the evaluation as clearly better position for White, but I would like you to play through a few more moves in order to show you another wonderful positional idea.} Bd7 13. b4 {This move is tactically achieves the goal of getting in the queenside expansion.} Qc8 14. Rb1 Bh3 15. e4 $1 {This is it! Let's hear once again what Simagin has to say: "A subtle positional continuation, which in my view is worth just as much as some spectacular combinations. White consistently pursues the strategy of making his opponent's dark squares bishop "bad". The weakening of d4 is without significance, as White's own dark- squared bishop has still been retained.} Bxg2 $6 {This falls right into White's plans.} (15... Be6 {is a difficult move to make but relatively the best.}) 16. Kxg2 $14 {Tigran won the game in fine fashion as you can see for yourself.} g6 17. h4 Bg7 18. h5 g5 19. Nd5 Nd4 20. Ne3 f5 21.
