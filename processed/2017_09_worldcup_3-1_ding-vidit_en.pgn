Black's position.} 13. O-O b6 14. Rc1 Qd7 15. Nh2 Bf5 16. Ng5 Nd5 17. Qb3 Rfd8
18. g4 Be6 19. Nxe6 Qxe6 {Even though White has been able to win the crucial
light squared bishop, he has had to weaken his kingside. I think it is a bit
too high a price to pay for getting the bishop.} 20. Rc2 Be5 21. Nf3 Bg7 22. g5

where Vidit had to think a bit and find a very powerful maoeuvre that would
have ended the game.} Rdb8 $2 {This move does absolutely nothing good to
Black's position.} (27... Be5 $19 {With the idea of putting the bishop on d6
would have be a clean way to win.} 28. Rc6 Bd6 $19) 28. Rxb8+ Rxb8 29. Bh3 $1 {
This must be the move that Vidit missed.} Qxh3 30. Qxd5 Rc8 31. Rxc8+ Qxc8 {
