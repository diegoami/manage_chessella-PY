Qc6 $3 {Such moves do not come all of a sudden! You have to first work with the natural moves in the position, to arrive at a move like Qc6.} (1. Rxb4+ $2 Rxh8 2. Bxd3 Rc8 {and there is no way to mate on the next move.}) (1. Rxe2+ $2 { This was another attempt which looked very logical.} Rxh8 (1... Kxb1 2. Qxd1#) 2. Bxd3 {And now it seems that Qxd1 mate is unstoppable. However, Black has the brilliant resource under his sleeve to delay the checkmate by just one more move!} Rc8 $1 3. Qxd1+ Rc1 {and it will be a mate, but not in three moves! }) (1. Bg7 $2 Rg8 {The rook pursues the bishop and we have simply wasted a move.}) (1. Bf6 $2 Rf8 {Again the rook just follows.}) (1. Bd4 $2 {Looks like a very serious attempt to mate in three.} Ra2 $1 {The only move to spoil White's plans.} 2. Bxa2 (2. Rxa2+ Kxb1) 2... b3 $1 3. Rb1+ Kxa2 4. Ra1# { Yes, it is mate, but in four moves!}) (1. Qd5 $2 {is the most common response from a lot of readers. The idea is to move the rook to b4 with a check, and when Black takes on h8, then to give a mate on a2 with the queen. How to stop such an idea?} e1=Q $1 2. Rxb4+ Qe5 $1 {This move is easy to miss. Now you can no longer mate in three.}) (1. Na3 {also looks very promising.} bxa3 (1... Rxa3 2. Rb3#) 2. Qxb7 Bb3 $1 {A move that is easy to miss.} 3. Rxb3+ Rxh8 4. Rxa3# { Once again, a move too late!}) 1... bxc6 (1... d2 2. Rxb4+ Rxh8 3. Qc3#) (1... b3 2. Rxb3+ Rxh8 3. Qc3#) (1... Rxh8 2. Qc1 $1 {The only move to win.} d2 3. Ra2#) (1... e1=Q 2. Qc1 $1 {This is not an easy move to spot.} Qc3 3. Bc2#) 2. Na3 $1 {The deep point of the study. Now taking with the rook mates with Rb3. But what if the pawn takes?} bxa3 (2... Rxa3 3. Rb3#) 3. Rb8# $1 {And now you see the point of Qc6!! It was to clear the b-file so that the white rook can interfere between the rook on a8 and the bishop on h8. A very pretty solution, don't you agree?} *
