Qc6 22. Na5 Qc7 23. Nb3 Qc6 24. Rd5 Nd7 25. Rd3 Nc5 26. Rf3 Rd7 {[#] The entire
battle in this game revolved around the d5 square. Giri has been careful not to
allow Magnus to somehow get his knight to d5 and is thus maintaining equal
chances.} 27. Na5 Qa8 $1 {Keeps an eye on the e4 pawn.} ( 27... Qc8 {Anish was
afraid of b4 followed by an eventual c4.}) 28. Qd5 $5 { With this move Magnus
gives up the fight for d5 but secures the c6 square for his knight. Both
players thought that they were doing very well at this point in the game. The
truth is somewhere is between - the position is round about equal.} Qxd5 29.
exd5 e4 30. Rh3 f5 {The rook on h3 is quite stupidly placed, but with his next
two moves Magnus clears the third rank.} 31. Nc6 Rb6 32. b4 Na4 33. c4 Rc7 34.
Rb3 Bd2 (34... Bf6 35. f3 {is pretty good for White.}) ( 34... Kg7 35. Nd4
{followed by Ne6 looked scary to Anish, although here bxc4 is very good for
Black.} bxc4 $15) 35. Rd1 Bg5 {In some lines now Black has Nb2 resources
attacking the rook on d1. This was the idea of losing a tempo with Bg5-d2-g5.}
36. g3 Bf6 37. Rc1 Rbxc6 {Black gets good compensation for the exchange.} 38.
dxc6 Rxc6 39. Rbb1 Bg5 $1 {This was the move that Magnus had missed. The rook
has to move to a square where it will be undefended, and then the c4 pawn could
be attacked further.} 40. Rc2 d5 41. c5 d4 {Optically Black's position looks
superb. If he gets three moves and brings his king over to d5, it will be a
horrible position for White. But Magnus senses the danger and quickly presses
the emergency brakes.} 42. Rd1 Bf6 (42... d3 43. Bxd3 exd3 44. Rxd3 $16 {is
clearly better for White because of the protected passed pawn on c5 and the
active rooks that will wreak havoc in Black's position.}) 43. Rcd2 Nc3 44. Rxd4
Nxd1 45. Rxd1 Bb2 46. Rd8+ Kf7 47. Ra8 Bxa3 48. Bxb5 Rc7 ( 48... axb5 49. Rxa3

Rb6 Bd6 52. Rb7 {A nice game with a lot of subtle ideas.} 1/2-1/2
