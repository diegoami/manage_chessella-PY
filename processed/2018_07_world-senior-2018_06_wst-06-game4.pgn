beat Boensch with a line I created,} 5. b3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 c5 $5 {We were both a
lot younger then.}) 5... Bb7 (5... Bb4 6. Qc2 Bb7 7. Bg2 Be4 {is more normal
for me, but I decided to branch out.}) 6. Bg2 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 d5 9. cxd5
exd5 10. Ne5 c5 11. dxc5 bxc5 12. b3 Bd6 {[#] I wasn't sure about this move,
but I felt I needed to prevent e2-e4} (12... Na6 13. e4 dxe4 14. Bb2) 13. Bb2
Re8 ({Originally I intended} 13... Qe7 {but I saw it would be killed by} 14. e4
) 14. Nd3 (14. Nec4 {is interesting} Bf8 (14... Bc7) 15. Bxf6 Qxf6 16. Na5 {
is bad, so I should go to c7 with the bishop}) 14... Nbd7 15. Rc1 Qb6 16. e3 {
Played after a long thought. I was ready for} (16. e4 c4 {The position seems
dynamically balanced.}) 16... a5 17. Nf4 Bxf4 ({I almost fell for} 17... Rad8
$2 18. Nxd5 Bxd5 19. Bxd5 Nxd5 20. Nc4 Qc6 21. e4) 18. gxf4 {certainly risky,

Qc2 axb3 20. axb3 Rab8 {[#] sitting on the b-pawn to keep White from
maneuvering his knight} 21. Be5 {I didn't see this move, but fortunately it's
not that strong.} ({I thought} 21. Qf5 {was good, though the computer does not
believe this move does anything.}) 21... Nxe5 22. fxe5 Nd7 (22... Rxe5 23. Qxc5
{the queen penetrates too fast for me to organize a kingside attack}) 23. f4 f6
(23... Qe6) 24. Qd3 {I didn't see this move} (24. Bh3 Rbd8 25. Bxd7 (25. e6

initiative to Black}) 24... fxe5 (24... Qc6 25. e4 d4 {computer says I'm
better, but I couldn't evaluate this position at all.}) 25. Bxd5+ Bxd5 (25...
Kh8 {looked too risky. The other boards were going well, so there;s no reason
to refuse the endgame which is quite comfortable for me.}) 26. Qxd5+ Qe6 27.
Qxe6+ Rxe6 28. f5 Rf6 29. e4 (29. Rf1 {looks better to me}) 29... Rd6 30. Re2
Rd3 31. Ra1 h5 32. h4 {This move sets up more potential mating patterns, but
it certainly weakens around the king.} Nf6 33. Ra5 Rbd8 34. Nc4 Ng4 {[#]} 35.
Kg2 $2 {Played instantly to play on my time shortage, but after} (35. Rxc5 {
I don't see more than a draw for Black}) 35... Rxb3 36. Rxc5 Rc3 {the pin is
decisive} 37. Rc6 Rdd3 38. Rc8+ Kh7 39. Nb6 (39. Nd6 Rg3+ 40. Kf1 Rcf3+ 41. Ke1
