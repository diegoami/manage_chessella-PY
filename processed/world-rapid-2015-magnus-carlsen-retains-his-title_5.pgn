Bc6 Rb8 20. b4 axb4 21. cxb4 Kh8 22. b5 Bxd5 23. Bxd5 Qb6 {We have reached quite a popular position in the Sveshnikov Variation where there have been many games and Zhigalko himself has had two draws against Azarov and Papp. But here Dominguez comes up with a novelty.} 24. Rh3 Qxb5 {Zhigalko took full seven minutes to get acquainted with the subtleties of the position.} (24... f5 {Maybe a move like this made more sense than taking the b5 pawn.}) 25. Qxb5 Rxb5 {This is a very instructive position. White is a pawn down but is slightly better because his bishop on d5 is a complete monster while the bishop on h6 is not doing much.} 26. g4 f6 27. Ra7 Rc8 28. Be6 (28. Rc3 Rbc5 29. Rxc5 dxc5 30. Ke2 {Followed by Kd3 is also a pleasant position for White but nothing special.}) 28... Rc1+ 29. Ke2 Rb2+ 30. Kf3 Rb8 31. Kg2 Rc2 32. Rb3 Rf8 33. Kf3 (33. Rbb7 Be3 {looks unplesant but White has a very strong move in} 34. Rf7 $3 Rb8 35. Rab7 $18) 33... Rd2 34. Rbb7 {As you can see, the White rooks have broken through and the extra pawn makes no sense at all.} Rc2 35. Rf7 Re8 36. Bd5 Rc3+ 37. Kg2 Rcc8 38. g5 $1 fxg5 39. hxg5 Bxg5 40. Rxg7 Re7 41.
