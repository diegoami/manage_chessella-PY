1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 c6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Be2 $5 {The point is not
having to recapture on c4 with the bishop.} Bd6 {A solid reply from Veselin
who relies on the 1990's theory to defang his opponent's preparation.} (6...
dxc4 7. a4 Bd6 8. Nd2 {is currently a topical line where White hasn't done too
badly.}) 7. O-O O-O 8. b3 b6 {This is the point. Black is willing to accept a
loss of one tempo on c7-c6-c5 to traspose into the Queens Indian Defense,
where White's Be2 isn't optimally placed - it should have been on d3.} 9. Bb2
Bb7 10. Qc2 Qe7 {[#] Actually, this position, most often reached through the
Qc2, b3 Anti-Meran move order is quite well-known. Ding himself had it on the
black side a couple of times.} 11. Rfe1 (11. Rad1 Rad8 12. cxd5 exd5 13. Bd3
Rfe8 14. Ne2 Ne4 15. Ng3 $11 {Yermolinsky-Wen Yang,Hainan 2016.}) 11... Rfe8
12. Rad1 Rad8 13. Bf1 c5 (13... e5 $5 14. g3 e4 {Korobov-Ding Liren 2017.}) 14.
cxd5 exd5 15. g3 {White completes a relocation of his bishop to its proper
spot for such structures. The problem is he's not doing anything fast enough
to cause Black any difficulty in completing his own development.} a6 {[#]} 16.
Bg2 ({In theory White should be welcoming a chance to play against the hanging
pawns, but here} 16. dxc5 {can also be met by} Nxc5 $5 (16... bxc5 17. Bg2 Nb6
18. Ne2 $14) 17. Nd4 Be5 18. Nce2 Nce4 {with a great degree of activity.})
16... Rc8 17. Qb1 h6 $5 {This appears to be a little strange, but waiting
moves make some sense.} ({I guess} 17... c4 {was a bit premature:} 18. bxc4
dxc4 (18... Rxc4 19. Nd2 Rc7 20. e4 $1) 19. e4 Bb4 20. Nd2 Qe6) ({Topalov
wasn't keen on weakening his dark squares with} 17... g6 18. dxc5 Nxc5 19. Qa1
Nce4 20. Nxe4 Nxe4 21. Rc1 $14) 18. Nh4 c4 19. Nf5 Qf8 20. Nxd6 $2 ({The
resolute} 20. e4 {deserved strong consideration.}) 20... Qxd6 21. bxc4 Rxc4 {
[#] White has the bishop pair and a better pawn structure, why isn't he the
one with the advantage? The thing is he has only his Bg2 to contest the light
squares, and that piece may be just too valauable to trade, even for a rook.}
22. a4 Rec8 (22... Ne4 23. Nxe4 dxe4 {was perfectly fine for Black.}) 23. Rc1
h5 24. h3 Nf8 25. Qa2 Ne6 26. Qb3 Qd8 27. Re2 (27. Bf1 Ng5 {is a good
indication of what was awaiting White.}) 27... Bc6 28. Rec2 b5 29. axb5 axb5
30. Nb1 Ng5 31. h4 Nge4 32. Na3 Qe7 $1 {[#] Another version of the typical
exchange sacrifice.} 33. Qd3 {Ding wisely says 'thanks, but no thanks'.} (33.
Nxc4 dxc4 34. Qa2 Bd5 35. Qa6 Rb8 $13) 33... Rxc2 34. Nxc2 Bd7 35. Qa3 Qe8 36.
Nb4 $6 {It is dangerous to abandon the kingside.} (36. Ne1 {was the better
choice.}) 36... Rc4 37. Rxc4 {A big-time positional concession.} ({In time
trouble it is very scary to invite lines such as} 37. Nd3 Ra4 38. Qb3 Nxg3 $1)
37... bxc4 38. Bc1 Be6 39. Na6 Qb5 40. Nc5 Kh7 41. Nxe6 ({Only a computer may
like} 41. Nxe4 Nxe4 42. Bxe4+ dxe4 {as White's best option}) 41... fxe6 42. Bf1
{[#]  The time control had been made, and Topalov was looking at a forced win.}
Nxf2 $2 {Not this way!} ({The simple} 42... Ng4 {would have brought a nice
positional game to it's logical conclusion.} 43. Qe7 (43. f3 Qb8) 43... Qb1 44.
Qxe6 Ngf6 45. Ba3 Nd2 46. Qh3 Nf3+ 47. Kg2 Ng4 $1 {and White simply cannot
move anything:} 48. Kxf3 Qf5+ 49. Kg2 Qxf2+ 50. Kh1 Qe1 51. Qg2 Nxe3 {etc.
What a shame.}) 43. Kxf2 Ne4+ 44. Ke2 $1 c3+ (44... Nxg3+ 45. Ke1 Nxf1 46. Kxf1
Qb1 47. Ke1 Qe4 48. Qe7 {White holds with ease.}) 45. Ke1 Qb1 46. Bg2 Qc2 47.
