Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ {After having played the same line successfully against Grischuk in the classical game earlier in the day, Magnus does not flinch from giving it another go.} Bd7 4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 5. c4 Nf6 6. Nc3 g6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bg7 9. f3 (9. O-O O-O 10. f3 Rc8 11. b3 d5 $1 $11 {is known to be an equalising idea since a long time. Hence f3 is more accurate than 0-0.}) 9... O-O 10. Be3 Nc6 11. Rc1 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 Rfc8 13. b3 {This is a position with a small but stable edge for White.} Nh5 $5 14. O-O Bxd4+ 15. Qxd4 Nf6 16. Rfe1 $1 {Magnus brings his rooks to the central files.} Rc7 17. Rcd1 Qc6 18. Nb5 (18. Nd5 Nxd5 19. exd5 $14 Qc5 20. Qxc5 dxc5 21. Rd2 {is also a pleasant position, but maybe Black can defend, as e7 is the only weakness right now.}) 18... Rd7 19. Nxa7 Qc5 20. Qxc5 dxc5 21. Nb5 Rxa2 22. e5 Rxd1 23. Rxd1 Nh5 24. g3 Rb2 25. Rd8+ Kg7 26. Re8 Rb1+ (26... Rxb3 27. Rxe7 Rxf3 28. Nd6 $16 { Black's biggest problem is his knight on h5.}) 27. Kg2 Rb2+ 28. Kg1 Rb1+ 29. Kg2 Rb2+ 30. Kh3 e6 31. Re7 Rxb3 32. Kg4 (32. Nd6 Rxf3 33. Kg2 Rc3 34. Rxf7+ Kg8 35. Rxb7 $16 {was a better way to gain an edge.}) 32... Kf8 33. Rxb7 h6 34. Rc7 f5+ 35. exf6 Nxf6+ 36. Kf4 g5+ 37. Ke5 Ne8 38. Rxc5 Re3+ 39. Kd4 Rxf3 { Maxime was playing with great speed and already had a big time advantage. Now his position was also pretty much defensible.} 40. Re5 Rf2 41. Rxe6 Rxh2 42. c5 h5 43. Nd6 $6 (43. Nc3 $14) 43... Nxd6 44. cxd6 Kf7 45. Re3 {Carlsen,M (2834) -Vachier-Lagrave,M (2773) London 2015} h4 46. g4 h3 47. Ke5 Rh1 48. d7 Ke7 49. Kf5+ Kxd7 50. Kxg5 {[#]It seems as if White is completely winning here because he just keeps an eye on the pawn with the rook. For eg. h2 is met with Re2, the black king is cut off and the white king moves to the h-file and starts pushing the g-pawn down the board. However, there is a study-like solution for Black to draw the game.} Kd6 ({or} 50... h2 51. Re2 Kd6 $1 {Only move. Black has to wait till the white king goes to the h-file before leaving the h1 square with his rook.} 52. Kh5 (52. Kg6 Rg1 $11) 52... Rc1 $1 53. Rxh2 Rc8 $3 { The only way to make a draw. The threat of skewering the rook from h8 makes it impossible to push the pawn to g5 which would be a theoretical win.} 54. Re2 Rh8+ 55. Kg5 Rg8+ 56. Kh5 Rh8+ $11) 51. Kh5 Rf1 $2 (51... h2 $1 52. Re2 Rc1 53. Rxh2 Rc8 $1 {and just like in the previous variation Black makes a draw.}) 52. Rxh3 Ke7 53. Kg6 $1 {Shouldering!} Rf6+ 54. Kg7 Rf7+ 55. Kg6 Rf6+ 56. Kg5 Ra6 ( 56... Kf7 57. Rh7+ $18) 57. Rf3 {The basic Lucena position will be reached pretty soon and Black will have to resign. A very interesting game especially with a nice touch in the rook endgame.} 1-0
