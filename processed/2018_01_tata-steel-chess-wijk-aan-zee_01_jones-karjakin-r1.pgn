1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 (7. Nc3
{is the 'main line' I was taught as a kid, but it has a number of problems.}
Nxe4 8. O-O Bxc3 9. d5 Ne5 (9... Bf6 {becomes needlessly messy, e.g.} 10. Re1
Ne7 11. Rxe4 d6 12. Bg5 Bxg5 13. Nxg5 O-O 14. Nxh7 $11 {and Black must be
precise to draw}) 10. bxc3 Nxc4 11. Qd4 O-O $1 12. Qxc4 Nd6 13. Qf4 b6 $11 {
White faces all the practical problems in this ending as his compensation does
not take the form of a real attack on the king.}) 7... Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 d5 9.
exd5 Nxd5 10. Qb3 {Here, Black's third most common move, other than the two he
played, is actually to agree a draw.} Na5 (10... Be6 {is a slightly
entertaining gambit line}) 11. Qa4+ Nc6 12. Qb3 Nce7 {My feeling is that this
optimism is maybe a bit misplaced, and Black soon ends up a little worse as
his position is after all a bit more difficult to play.} 13. O-O O-O 14. Rfe1
c6 15. Ne4 Nb6 (15... a5 16. Ne5 f6 $11 {is the engine suggestion but you have
to be reasonably sure of yourself to cue up White's future Ne6 motifs.}) 16.
Bd3 Ned5 17. Nc5 {This was the position on the board when I began my game in
the 4NCL (British chess league.) Shortly before leaving my room, I noted down
a prediction- White to win here. It does indeed look slightly more pleasant,
but of course IQP positions are always hard to play.} Nf6 18. Rac1 Rb8 {
When you play such moves, you must ipso facto be slightly worse. Finding a
plan for White is, however, not totally trivial.} 19. Qa3 ({One of my best
ideas in the position, I think, is to try and exploit the position of the
Black rook by means of a cumbersome-looking 'queen lift'.} 19. Qb4 $5 Nfd5 {
If this isn't played now or next, the White queen gets to f4.} 20. Qd2 Nd7 21.
Nb3 $14 {Black still lacks ways to complete his development.}) 19... a6 20. Qb3
Qc7 21. Ne4 (21. Ne5 $14 {was another relatively easy move to make, with the
idea of Qd1-f3 and (if allowed) Bc2-b3! Black also lacks ...Rd8 due to a
rather cheap tactic.}) 21... Nfd5 22. Nc3 Qd6 23. Be4 Bg4 $1 {Black has now
completely equalised.} 24. Nxd5 (24. Ne5 Be6 25. Bxd5 Nxd5 26. Ne4 {looks
tactically tricky, but Black's defenses are all in place after} Qd8 27. Nc5 Re8
$11) 24... cxd5 25. Bb1 Bxf3 {Now White lacks the dynamism he would need to
try and win, and in fact if Black could get his knight to c6 he could try
something. A few more good-enough moves and peace broke out.} 26. Qxf3 Rfe8 27.
