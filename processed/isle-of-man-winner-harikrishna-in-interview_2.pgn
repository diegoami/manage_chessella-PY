At the peak of his career he was known as "The Best of the West". Checking out his games, I noticed he has a wide range of opening reportire and knew he could play anything he wanted to.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 {The sharpest variation in the Two Knight's Defence. I was actually happy with this because, requiring to win for my GM norm, I couldn't have asked for a more dyanmic opening.} d5 5. exd5 Na5 6. Bb5+ c6 7. dxc6 bxc6 8. Bd3 Nd5 9. h4 $5 {I had faced this rare variation twice, losing both times. I opted for the third possible move in this game!} Be7 (9... Nf4 10. Bf1 h6 11. Nf3 Bd6 12. d4 exd4 13. Qxd4 Qe7+ 14.

Qf3 {I spent a lot of time trying to recall my analysis in this variation, but failed to do it completely. So, looking at the circumstances, I decided to avoid complications for the time being.} Nf6 $6 {Interestingly, this move was played twice already.} (10... Nf4 11. Nxf7 Kxf7 12. g3 $16 {with a very comfortable position for White.}) (10... Bxg5 11. hxg5 Qxg5 12. Rh5 $1 {And White regains his pawn back. For example} Qf6 (12... Qe7 13. Qg3 f6 14. Rxh7 $16) 13.

Nc3 O-O $6 {Commiting the king too early is a mistake. It makes White's play easier.} (11... h6 12. Nge4 Nd5 {was a better way for Black to play, as happened in: Pijpers,A (2313)-Werle,J (2539) Netherlands 2012 ½-½}) (11... Rb8 12. a3 c5 13. Bb5+ Bd7 {Poetsch,H (2475) -Diermair,A (2449) Jenbach AUT 2013 ½-½}) 12. a3 $1 {Forces Black to give up the control over the c4 square.} (12. Nce4 Nxe4 13. Qxe4 f5 $44) 12... Qc7 13. b4 Nb7 14.

Qe2 $16 {I was expecting this}) 15... h6 16. Bxc6 $2 {Was unnecessary. I think my opponent considered if I captured his knight it would give him a very strong attack, but it wasn't so clear.} (16. Bb2 $16 {White being material ahead, safer king, better placed pieces, is always a favorite.}) 16... hxg5 17. hxg5 Bxg5 18. d4 (18.

Rxf4 {was better maybe, but with the clock ticking you always want to play safe!}) 33. d6 Rae8 34. c5 Qd5 {Covering the dangerous a2-g8 diagonal and avoiding checks, also planning a shrewd attack against the white king.} 35. Rh3 Re2 36. Qf3 $4 { This loses on the spot} (36. Qc4 Rxg2+ 37. Kf1 Qxc4+ 38. Rxc4 Rd2 $19 { Stopping white's pawns from advancing further and also expoiting white's king position.}) (36. Rg3 Bf5 37.
