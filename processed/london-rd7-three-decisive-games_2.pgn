        Gg8f6,Gf6d5,Gd5b4,Gb4d3,Gd3f4,Gf4e6] What has Black achieved by making 
        six knight moves out of the eight moves played so far? First of all White 
        has lost the right to 0-0 and secondly the d4 square is weak. Meanwhile 
        Black is behind in development, and a player like Aronian doesn't have 
        to be asked twice to play aggressively.} 9. b4 $1 {Sacrificing a pawn 
        in order to get a strong center.} cxb4 10. Nd5 g6 11. d4 Bg7 12. Be3 Nc6

        however this had to be the best way for Black to play. In the game he 
        delays 0-0 but is unable to come up with anything consructive.} h5 $1

        It really doesn't seem like White made so many moves with his king as 
        Black too wasn't able to do anything concrete.} Rd8 (20... g4 21. Ne5

        by Qxe7 is a strong threat. Black must do something about it.} Bh6 24.
