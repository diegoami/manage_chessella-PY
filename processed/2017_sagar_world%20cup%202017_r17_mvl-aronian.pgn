{A boring 19 move grandmaster draw? Well, MVL is an ambitious player, so if he
agrees to a draw so soon, there has to be something very nice about Aronian's
preparation.} 1. e4 {[%emt 0:00:00]} e5 {[%emt 0:00:06]} 2. Nf3 {[%emt 0:00:00]
} Nc6 {[%emt 0:00:06]} 3. Bb5 {[%emt 0:00:00]} a6 {[%emt 0:00:06]} 4. Ba4 {
[%emt 0:00:00]} Nf6 {[%emt 0:00:07]} 5. O-O {[%emt 0:00:00]} Be7 {[%emt 0:00:
05]} 6. d3 {[%emt 0:00:22] Once the e4 pawn is defended, Black has to be
careful about his e5 pawn. The threat now is Bxc6 and Nxe5.} b5 {[%emt 0:00:06]
} 7. Bb3 {[%emt 0:00:08]} d6 {[%emt 0:00:05] Once the e5 pawn is defended,
White has to be careful about Na5, winning his important Ruy Lopez bishop.
It's small points like these that help you to remember complex long lines in
the opening.} 8. a3 {[%emt 0:00:13]} O-O {[%emt 0:00:07]} 9. Nc3 {[%emt 0:00:
05]} Bg4 $5 {[%emt 0:00:05] This came as a big surprise to MVL. The main
reason being Levon has reached this position seven times and six times he has
played ...Na5. On the one occasion where he didn't play Na5, he had gone for ..
.Be6. So Bg4 came as a surprise. I like this move because it is very direct
and has a clear threat - ...Nd4!?} (9... Na5 10. Ba2 Be6 {is one of the main
lines.}) (9... Be6 $5 {is also possible.}) 10. Be3 {[%emt 0:00:39]} Nd4 {
[%emt 0:00:04]} 11. Bxd4 {[%emt 0:00:05]} exd4 {[%emt 0:00:04]} 12. Nd5 {
[%emt 0:00:06]} Nxd5 {[%emt 0:00:05]} (12... Nd7 {has been played in 50 games.}
13. h3 Bxf3 14. Qxf3 c6 15. Nxe7+ (15. Nf4 {is also possible.}) 15... Qxe7 16.
Qg3 $36 {With f4 coming up, White can hope for a slight initiative here.}) (
12... c5 13. h3 Be6 14. Nf4 Bxb3 15. cxb3 {with an interesting and complex
position.}) 13. Bxd5 {[%emt 0:01:02]} (13. exd5 $6 Bf6 $15) 13... Rc8 {[%emt 0:
00:09] The importance of this move will become clear very soon.} (13... Rb8 {
was also possible but White is better in that case after} 14. a4 $5 $14) 14. h3
{[%emt 0:00:09]} (14. Bb7 $6 Rb8 15. Bxa6 $4 {And the pawn on a6 is taboo.} Rb6
$19) (14. Bc6 {was played by Kashlinskaya and perhaps this is where White's
hope for an opening advantage lie.} Bf6 15. a4 Rb8 16. axb5 axb5 17. Ra7 Rb6
18. Bd5 c6 19. Bb3 Qb8 $11 {Although Kaslinskaya won this game, I do not see
how and why Black should be better here.1-0 (36) Kashlinskaya,A (2433)-Guseva,
M (2352) Bilbao 2014}) 14... Bd7 $1 {[%emt 0:00:05] Keeping the bishop and
controlling the important c6 square.} (14... Bxf3 15. Qxf3 $14 {In this
opposite coloured bishop endgame, White would be happy to press for many moves,
thanks to his superior bishop.}) 15. Nxd4 {[%emt 0:09:57]} c6 $1 {[%emt 0:00:
06] Now you can see the usefulness of having the rook on c8.} 16. Bb3 {[%emt 0:
00:51]} Bf6 {[%emt 0:00:06] The bishop attacks the knight and it cannot move
as the b2 pawn hangs.} 17. c3 {[%emt 0:00:06]} Bxd4 {[%emt 0:00:04]} 18. cxd4 {
[%emt 0:00:06]} Qf6 {[%emt 0:00:04] There is no way d4 pawn can be defended.}
19. Qd2 {[%emt 0:03:35] Maxime made this move and offered a draw, which was
accepted by Levon. I think this was a very successful opening innovation by
Aronian and the ball is in White's court. How can he find an idea that will
keep the play interesting against the Armenian's simple and straight forward
plan.} (19. d5 Qxb2 {White risks being worse here.}) (19. Qd2 Qxd4 $11) 1/2-1/2
