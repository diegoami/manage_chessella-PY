Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5 Bd5 11. Qc2 Be4 12. Qd1 {This is the line where White
has been scoring really well recently. Giri beat Leko with white, and Nakamura
got the better of Anand. In both the games Black played c5 in this position.
Surya goes for the second most popular move:} h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. Nc3 Bxf3 15.
Bxf3 c6 {Black makes the typical exchange of light squared bishop and putting
his pawn on c6. This position should be slightly better for White, but
bordering very much on the edge of equality.} 16. Qb3 Qc7 17. e3 (17. Rfd1 { is
definitely more popular.}) 17... a5 18. Be2 Na6 19. Ne4 Be7 20. Rac1 Nb4 21.
Bc4 Rae8 22. f4 Bd8 23. Qd1 Qe7 {Ganguly tries to remain as solid as he can
without making any committments.} 24. Qf3 Nd5 25. Rc2 Qb4 26. Nc5 Re7 27. e4
Bb6 $1 {Being tactically alert. Now it was important to get the king out to g2.
However, Howell seemed to be surprised with the move Bb6 and instead took on
d5.} 28. exd5 $6 (28. Kg2 $1 Bxc5 29. dxc5 Nf6 30. e5 Nd5 31. Qe4 $11 {with a
round about equal position.}) 28... cxd5 $1 {The bishop cannot move as Qxd4
will lose two pawns as well as the c5 knight.} 29. Qb3 (29. Ba2 Qxd4+ 30. Qf2
Qxf2+ $1 31. Rfxf2 Rc7 $1 $19 {The knight on c5 is lost.}) 29... Bxc5 30. dxc5
Qxc5+ 31. Rff2 dxc4 32. Qxc4 Qa7 $17 {For a player of Ganguly's calibre rest is
not very difficult. He is not only a pawn up but also has the safer king. It
took him so time to convert but the result wasn't really in doubt at any point
in the game.} 33. Kg2 Rd7 34. Rfd2 b6 35. Qc6 Rfd8 36. Rxd7 Rxd7 37. h4 h5 38.
