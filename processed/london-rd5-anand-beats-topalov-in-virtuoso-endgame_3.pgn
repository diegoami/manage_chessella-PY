Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O Nxe4 5. d4 Nd6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. dxe5 Nf5 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. h3 Ke8 10. Nc3 h5 11. Bf4 Be7 12. Rad1 Be6 13. Ng5 Rh6 14. g3 {All this has been seen in many games at the top level, even in the Carlsen-Anand match from 2014. Here mainly everyone takes on g5, but Kramnik in his game against Adams had tried a new move 14...Bc4. Giri had an improvement on Kramnik's play and went for the same line.} Bc4 15. Rfe1 Rg6 16. Nce4 Rd8 17. Rxd8+ Bxd8 18. b3 Bd5 19. c4 {We are still following Adams-Kramnik. Here Kramnik took the knight on g5 with Bxg5. While watching that game Giri had a logical doubt in his mind: Why not Nd4? Of course he worked on this move at home and decided that it was not at all bad.} Nd4 $1 $146 (19... Bxg5 20. Nxg5 Be6 {was Adams-Kramnik, London 2014.}) 20. cxd5 cxd5 21. Nd6+ {Maxime goes for the most critical approach.} (21. Kg2 dxe4 22. Nxe4 { is another way to play although after} Ra6 $11 {Black shouldn't have any problems.}) 21... cxd6 22. exd6+ Ne6 23. Nf3 Bf6 24. Be3 Kd7 25. Bxa7 Rh6 $1 { Black gets his rook back in to the game via h8.} 26. Rd1 Kxd6 27. Bb8+ Kc6 28. Rc1+ (28. Be5 {was an option but after} Rh8 29. Bxf6 gxf6 $13 {both sides have their trumps. Black's structure is mangled but his pawn on d5 shephered by the king on c5 would be very strong.}) 28... Kd7 29. Rd1 Kc6 30. Rc1+ Kd7 31. Rd1 { A very correct game, you could say!} 1/2-1/2
