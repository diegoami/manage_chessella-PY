1. c4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nf3 c5 {A sequence of moves known to English chess fans
as the 'Sniper'...} 4. d5 d6 (4... b5 $5 {probably transposes to a Benko
gambit:} 5. cxb5 a6 6. e4 (6. bxa6 Nf6 7. Nc3 Bxa6 8. e4 Bxf1 9. Kxf1 d6 {
is a main line}) 6... axb5 7. e5 b4 $13 {This position is sufficiently modern
for the most exacting taste, and I think Black is probably fine if he
continues with ...Nh6 and/or ...Ba6, developing as many pieces to the side as
possible.}) 5. e4 e6 6. Bd3 exd5 7. cxd5 ({I was always taught that if White
is able to recapture with the e-pawn, i.e.} 7. exd5 $14 {then the Benoni
construction has basically failed and White is better.}) 7... Bg4 ({A good
question to ask is why not} 7... Nf6 {?} {Maybe} 8. h3 (8. Nc3 O-O 9. O-O ({Or
} 9. h3 b5) 9... Bg4 {is main line theory.}) 8... O-O 9. O-O {might have been
something Black didn't like- the move order certainly raises unusual questions.
Play could continue} b5 $6 (9... c4 10. Bc2 b5 $132 {is better}) 10. Bxb5 Nxe4
11. Re1 Nf6 12. Nc3 $14 {when the position resembles the line which refutes 1.
d4 b5.}) 8. Nbd2 $1 $14 Nf6 9. O-O O-O 10. h3 Bxf3 11. Nxf3 c4 12. Bxc4 Nxe4
13. Re1 Re8 14. Qc2 Nf6 15. Rxe8+ Nxe8 16. Bg5 {It's just a bishop pair, and
Black lacks the usual compensations that the Benoni offers.} Nf6 17. Nd4 (17.
Re1 {was more natural for me}) 17... Qb6 {Probably relying on ...Nxe3, but
White's next makes this irrelevant.} ({After the natural} 17... Nbd7 18. Ne6 $5
{could be the point, but the story doesn't necessarily end here:} fxe6 19. dxe6
d5 20. Bxd5 Nf8 21. Bxb7 Rb8 22. Bc6 $44) 18. Be3 Ng4 $6 {Not a great move,
but the position wasn't fun anyway.} 19. Qe4 Nf6 (19... Nxe3 20. Qe8+ Bf8 21.
fxe3 {leaves Black completely helpless against Rf1 and Ne6 ideas, despite the
initially optimistic prognosis of the machine. For instance} Qc7 22. Ne6 fxe6
23. dxe6 Qe7 24. Qc8 $18 {with Rf1-f7 to come.}) 20. Qe7 {The position, and
this move in particular, give me flashbacks to the game Hawkins-Fernandez,
4NCL 2016, when I tried some kind of KID/Benko mashup.} Nbd7 21. Nb5 Bf8 22.

Rc1 Ra8 29. Rc2 Ra6 30. Re2 Ra4 ({If Black has to defend passively with} 30...
Ra8 {then he is not long for this world, but there might not have been
anything objectively better.}) 31. Re8 $18 {A well-calculated way to clinch
the game in tactics rather than technique.} Rxc4 32. Rd8 Ne5 (32... Rb4 33. a4
$1 {doesn't change much}) 33. f4 Nd3 34. Bf6 Re4 35. Nxd6 Re1+ 36. Kh2 Nf2 {
Directed against White's most obvious idea of Nc8-e7, but there are others.}

Kh7 40. Rxf8 Nd3 {This move looks like it threatens perpetual check, but in
fact it doesn't even do that. Black is beyond saving, of course.} 41. Rxf7+ Kh8
42. Rf8+ {Probably the idea was Nf7 next and then the White king trivially
dodges the checks using f3.} 1-0
