1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Bg4 3. Bg2 c6 4. c4 e6 5. O-O Nd7 6. cxd5 cxd5 $5 {This might
have come as a surprise to Wagner due to its drawish tendency, although in my
opinion this is Black's best choice and the position's dynamism would not dry
up that fast. At least that is what Nakamura masterfully showed.} 7. Nc3 Ngf6
8. d3 Bc5 9. h3 Bh5 10. e4 $6 {Black intends to dominate the dark squares and
White just walks into what Black is trying to prevent. Although, this move is
not wrong in essence, it does not appeal to me because it plays into Black's
plans.} (10. Bf4 {is dry but at least is a good waiting move.}) 10... dxe4 11.
dxe4 O-O 12. Qe2 Bxf3 $1 {If White's pawns start rolling, then that bishop on
h5 will be very uncomfortable. Now Nakamura dominates the dark squares.} 13.
Bxf3 Ne5 14. Rd1 (14. Bf4 {There was time for White to offer a draw before
things got dire.}) 14... Qb6 (14... Nxf3+ 15. Qxf3 Qb6 16. b3 {is very drawish.
Black has no need to go for this.}) 15. Bg2 Bd4 16. Bd2 Rfd8 17. Be1 Nc6 18.
Kh2 e5 $6 {Black is in complete control on dark squares. The position is still
balanced but is much easier to play with Black. However, the last move is a bit
reckless, giving up the d5 square.} 19. f4 (19. Nd5 {might have given White
some edge.} Nxd5 20. exd5 Ne7 (20... Nb4 21. Qc4) 21. Rxd4 Qxd4 $1 22. Bc3 Qc5
23. Qxe5 f6 24. Qe6+ Kh8 25. Rd1 {and White is better.}) 19... Re8 20. Nb5 exf4
21. gxf4 Be3 22. Bd2 Nd5 $1 {The position is still balanced but this move,
which might have come as a shock for Wagner, alters his self-control and causes
him to make a number of mistakes.} 23. Nd6 Bxf4+ 24. Bxf4 Nxf4 25. Qf3 $6 (25.
Qg4 Nxg2 26. Nxe8 Rxe8 27. Qxg2 Qe3 { is only balanced.}) 25... g5 26. Nxe8
Rxe8 27. Qg3 $6 {Another waste of time.} h6 28. Rd2 Ne5 29. Rad1 $2 {but this
is just a huge blunder:} (29. Rf1 Qg6 30. Rxf4 gxf4 31. Qxf4 Qg5 32. Qg3
{should be possible to defend but it would a long-term agony for White.}) 29...
Nc4 30. Rd7 Qxb2 31. Rf1 Ne5 32. Rd6 Neg6 33. Rf2 { Now material is balanced
and Black dominates the dark squares. White is doomed. } Qe5 34. Rd7 Rc8 35.
Rxb7 h5 (35... Rc3 36. Rf3 Rc2 {was winning immediately.} ) 36. Kh1 Rc3 37. Rf3
Rc2 38. Rf2 Rc3 39. Rf3 h4 40. Qe1 Rc2 {A fine classical victory for Nakamura
who moved into a healthy +4 right behind the world champion!} 0-1
