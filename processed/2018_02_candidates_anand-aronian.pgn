insists on sacrificing the pawn, he can do just that.} 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nbd2 {

cases he has adequate compensation.}) (11. c3 {has appeared numerous times as

be checked in practice. The isolated pawn is a drawback, but White will have
some dynamic play exploting some weak spots in Black's camp.}) 13... Qd7 14.

Re1 {The rook should go back as it is vulnerable in the centre.} Rae8 {Black
doesn't have immediate threats, but the activity of all his pieces normally
yields him enough play to maintain the balance, which is quite typical for
this line.} 15. Nf3 Bd6 (15... Qf5 $6 16. Nh4 {and the queen has to go back,
losing time.}) 16. Be3 Re7 $6 {This is too innocuous. Black's play should be
somewhat more dynamic.} (16... Nd5 {It's recommended for Black to get one of
the opponent's bishops.} 17. a4 (17. Bd2 Rxe1+ 18. Nxe1 Qf5 19. Qg4 Qe5 {

after} c5 {it won't be easy for White to play d3-d4 and perform the
simplifying idea that Anand realised a couple of moves later.}) 17... Rfe8 (

Qf5-e5 as in the line 16...Nd5.}) 18. c3 h6 {Probably Levon underestimated the
consequences of the move that now follows. On the other hand, it seems that
White is already better. The pressure along the e-file doesn't bring Black any
dividends.} (18... Nd5 19. Bd2 Rxe1+ 20. Nxe1 c5 21. dxc5 Bxc5 22. Nd3 Bb6 23.

surely Anand improves his position.} Bc8 30. Bf1 R5e6 31. Rd3 {The rook is

beyond saving anyway.} 40. Rxc6 Rd8 41. Rc4 Bd7 (41... Nxb2 42. Bxb2 Rd2+ 43.

of confidence from the very beginning of the Candidates tournament.} (47. Kc3
