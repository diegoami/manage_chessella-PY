1. d4 {This is one of the best positional games of the event. I chose this over
many others because it was played between two players among the leaders.} Nf6
2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Bg5 Bb4+ 5. Nbd2 {An interesting move. If you would have
asked me in 2011 I would have told you that this line is just dubious for
white. Dubov, known for his outstanding opening preparation, has other ideas!}

in 2015.} Bd7 8. Qc2 b5 9. a3 Be7 (9... Bxd2+ 10. Nxd2 e5 11. dxe5 Nxe5 { And I
think here Dubov might have prepared this, although, even in his game against
Matlakov he had the current European Champion on the ropes.} 12. a4 (12. b3
cxb3 13. Nxb3 O-O 14. Be2 Rc8 15. Nc5 Bc6 16. Rd1 Qe7 17. O-O {I am sure Dubov
had prepared another 10 moves from here onward! The position is extremely
complicated. White has a lot of play on dark squares in return for his
sacrificed pawn.}) 12... h6 13. Bh4 O-O 14. axb5 Bxb5 15. Nxc4 Qe7 16. Nxe5

prove his compensation for the sacrificed pawn, which should be doable but not
without practical difficulties.}) 11. Nxb3 Rb8 (11... a6 12. e4 h6 13. Be3 O-O

which looks like a complete waste of time to me.} (14... b4 15. a4 Nc3 { was
called for.}) 15. O-O Bxg3 16. hxg3 O-O 17. e4 Nf6 18. Rfe1 {White has
dominated center and he has a lot more space. c5 is a nice outpost that white
loves to use and I have a hard time seeing a counter play for black. All these
activities for a just a pawn shows that Dubov's opening concept has proven
itself.} Be8 19. Rad1 Rb6 20. Qc1 Ne7 21. Nc5 Nd7 22. Bb1 (22. g4 {deserves
attention}) 22... Qc8 23. d5 $1 {From here till end of the game, Dubov's play
is so instructive and beautiful. It is hard to pinpoint a move as Black's main
mistake in this game.} Nxc5 24. Qxc5 Ng6 25. e5 $1 {Infantry should move
forward!} exd5 26. Nd4 $1 {each of White's pieces is active and has a share of
center. White's dominance is so obvious that Dubov is not worried about two
sacrificed pawns!} Bd7 27. f4 Re8 28. e6 $1 {White wins a piece for three pawns
but the issue is not about material. White maintains his dominance regardless
of drastic change in piece formation.} Bxe6 29. f5 Nf8 30. fxe6 Nxe6 31. Qc2

masterpiece by Dubov!} 1-0
