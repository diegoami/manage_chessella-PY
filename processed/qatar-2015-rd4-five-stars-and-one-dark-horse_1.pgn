1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. d4 Nf6 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 {It is surprising to
see Vladimir playing something mainstream.} dxc4 7. Na3 c3 8. bxc3 c5 9. Ne5
Nc6 $1 {Daniel is well prepared. Giving up this pawn is quite well known.} 10.
Nac4 $1 (10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Bxc6 Bh3 $44 {Gives Black excellent compensation.})
10... Nd5 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Bd2 Ba6 13. Ne5 Qd6 14. Re1 cxd4 (14... Bxe5 15.
dxe5 Qxe5 {is similar to the game but here having the c3 and c5 pawns means
that the White queen can go to a3 and try to put pressure on the c5 pawn. White
has the pleasant position here too.} 16. Qc1 $1 $14) 15. cxd4 Bxe5 16. dxe5
Qxe5 17. Rc1 {What is White's compensation for the missing pawn? First of all
he has the bishop pair, which is a huge asset in this open position. Secondly
the knight on d5 is not stable as e4 will be coming soon. And lastly the c6
pawn is quite weak and will most probably fall.} Rfd8 18. Qc2 Rac8 19. Qc5 Qd6
20. Qa5 (20. Qxa7 c5 {lands the white queen in a precarious situation on a7.})
20... c5 21. Bh3 e6 22. Bg5 Re8 (22... Rd7 {was maybe a tad better.}) 23. Rcd1
Qe5 24. Bd2 Qh5 25. Bf1 Bb7 26. Qxa7 Rc7 27. Qa4 Ra8 28. Qc4 Nb6 29. Qc1 c4 30.
Bg5 {Until this point both the players have been matching blow for blow and
playing pretty well. However, here Daniel goes completely wrong and lands up in
a lost position.} Qg4 $2 31. Bd8 $1 (31. e4 $1 {was even stronger. The threat
is to play h3 and Bg2 and trap the queen.}) 31... Rc6 32. h3 Qh5 33. Bg5 {g4
with the threat of winning the queen is not so easy to parry.} Rc5 34. Bf6 Qf5
35. Bd4 Rb5 36. e4 Qf3 37. Bg2 Qa3 38. Qxa3 Rxa3 39. Rb1 $1 {A simple move that
wins the house.} Rxb1 40. Rxb1 {The knight on b6 and the bishop on b7 are so
awkwardly placed that one of them will fall.} c3 41. Bxb6 {A nice win for
Kramnik after surviving a scare against Vocaturo yesterday. Daniel Naroditsky
played quite well and can be happy at giving the World Champion quite a tough
fight.} 1-0
