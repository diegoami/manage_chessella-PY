1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 O-O 6. e3 a6 7. Qc2 Nc6 ({A
more popular option here is the move of the knight to d7, a move that had been
tried by GM Kamsky against GM Khalifmann in the following game:} 7... Nbd7 8.
cxd5 {White stablizes the central pawn structure by exchanging on d5 here.
This would either signal White's intention to play for a minority attack on
the queenside or to castle on the queenside and then launch a kingside attack.}
exd5 9. Bd3 c6 10. h3 {White prepares for the g2-g4 pawn push.} Re8 11. g4 Nf8

Rhg1 {White has seized control of the semi-open g-file. I would very much
prefer White's game here...} Kh8 19. Rg4 Nf6 20. Rdg1 N8d7 21. Rh4 Qe7 22. Kb1
c5 23. Qf2 Rf8 24. Qg3 cxd4 25. Bxd4 {White's bishop pair dominates. He has
the advantage, which he duly converted in the end. 1-0 Khalifman,A - Kamsky,G/
Las Vegas 1999.}) 8. a3 {A natural move here to prevent the black knight from
going to b4.} ({In an earlier game, Colin Crouch as white played h2-h3 here
and this allowed black to move his knight to b4, followed by a series of
freeing move and exchanges. Black succeeded in trading down to an equal
endgame.} 8. h3 Nb4 9. Qb1 c5 10. a3 Nc6 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Bg5 d4 13. Ne4 Be7

Grande 1993.}) 8... Nh5 9. Bg3 ({The immediate:} 9. Be5 {is also possible here.
} g6 10. Be2 Rb8 11. Rd1 dxc4 {The delay of black in moving his knight back
from the edge of the board will be a key factor in white's decision to trade
down into an advantageous endgame.} 12. Bxc4 b5 13. Ba2 Bb7 14. O-O Nxe5 15.
Nxe5 b4 16. axb4 Bxb4 17. Ne4 Qe7 18. Rc1 Bd6 19. Nc5 {White is already better.
} Bxe5 20. dxe5 Rfd8 21. f4 Ng7 22. e4 {White duly converted the advantage he
has in this position. 1-0 Vouldis,A (2497)-Miladinovic,I (2563)/Ano Liosia
2001.}) 9... Bf6 10. Be5 g6 11. Bxf6 Nxf6 12. Be2 Qd6 {Black is planning the
e6-e5 pawn advance.} 13. Rd1 Bd7 14. O-O Rad8 15. b4 {White continues to gain
space - this will further limit black's options of freeing pawn breaks.} Qe7
16. e4 dxe4 17. Nxe4 Bc8 18. Rfe1 Nxe4 19. Qxe4 Qf6 20. Bf1 Rd7 21. Rd2 Rfd8
22. Red1 {White has a slight edge. But, given black's solid pawn structure and
lack of weakness, white may not be able to convert his advantage.} Qg7 23. Qe3
Re7 24. Ne5 Bd7 25. b5 Nb8 26. a4 Be8 27. c5 axb5 28. axb5 f6 29. Nf3 Nd7 30.

escape nor hide from the white queen's checks.} 52. Qe7+ Kg6 53. Qe8+ Kg5 54.
