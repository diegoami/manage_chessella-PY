1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3 $5 {The modern move order. White plans on
spicing it up with a mix of ideas, some of which involve an early g2-g4.} Bd6 (
{Nepomniatchi-Anand, London Classic 2017 saw} 4... a6 5. b3 Bd6 6. Bb2 O-O 7.
g4 $5 {That game may have inspired Vishy to try this whole thing with White!})
({In a similar vein Grischuk-Kramnik, Tal Memorial Blitz 2018 featured} 4...
Be7 5. b3 O-O 6. Bb2 dxc4 7. bxc4 c5 8. Rg1 $5 Nc6 9. g4) ({Black also has a
couple of solid options:} 4... c5 5. cxd5 exd5 6. d4 Nc6 7. Bb5 {is a reverse
Nimzo-Indian,}) ({while} 4... c6 5. b3 Nbd7 6. Bb2 Be7 {may lead to a Semi-Slav
should White finally settle on} 7. d4) 5. b3 O-O 6. Bb2 c5 {Hou chooses the
most principled continuation as she had a surprise prepared.} ({ Again,} 6...
b6 {leads to a more standard pawn formation:} 7. Qc2 c6 8. Be2 Bb7 9. cxd5 exd5
{So-Caruana, GCT Paris Blitz 2017}) 7. g4 d4 $5 {[#] Played for the first time
in Loxine-Santos Ruiz, Bundesliga 2017-18, this sharp move poses a set of
interesting problems for White to solve. At the very least White doesn't just
get to push Black back for free, as happened in some of the games mentioned
above.} 8. exd4 cxd4 9. Nxd4 e5 10. Nf5 Bxf5 11. gxf5 Nc6 { A new move.
Clearly, Hou was well-prepared.} ({Santos Ruiz chose} 11... e4) 12. Bg2 Nb4 13.
Qe2 $3 {An absolutely amazing concept from Anand. He's willing to give up the
exchange and lose the right to castle, all in return for long-term positional
compensation.} ({The main line runs as follows:} 13. d3 Bc5 14. Be4 Nxe4
({Should they find themselves in a more adventurous mood Black can even think
of} 14... Bd4 $5) 15. Nxe4 Nxd3+ 16. Ke2 Nxb2 17. Qxd8 Rfxd8 18. Nxc5 b6 19.
Na6 Rd4 $11) 13... Nc2+ 14. Kd1 Nxa1 15. Bxa1 Qd7 ({Possibly that b-pawn could
have been retained with} 15... Rb8 {and then put into good use in case of } 16.
Nd5 b5 $1) 16. Ne4 Qxf5 17. Nxf6+ Qxf6 18. Bxb7 Rad8 19. Kc2 Rfe8 20. Bc3 Bc5
(20... Bb4 {would have accomplished the same goal of trading bishops a bit
faster.}) 21. f3 Bd4 22. Re1 g6 23. Qe4 Kg7 24. Bd5 {[#] No doubt Anand was
inspired by Karjakin's win over Caruana at the Candidates. Is Bd5 really worth
a rook?} Qb6 $2 {Ineffective.} ({Instead,} 24... Bxc3 25. dxc3 Qf4 {seemed the
right plan.} 26. Qxf4 ({Better is} 26. Qe2 $1) 26... exf4 27. Rxe8 Rxe8 28. c5
(28. b4 Re2+ 29. Kb3 (29. Kd3 Rxa2 30. c5 Kf6 {and the king can stop the
c-pawn.}) 29... Rxh2 {is a dangerous situation for White, whose bishop is
unable to stop the h-pawn.} 30. c5 Re2 31. b5 h5) 28... g5 29. b4 h5 30. a4 g4
31. fxg4 hxg4 {[#] Black appears to be ahead in the race, as the White king
remains a non-factor.} 32. b5 Kf6 33. c4 Ke5 34. Kc3 $1 {but he saves the day
at the last moment!} (34. a5 $2 Kd4 35. c6 f3 36. c7 f2 37. Bg2 Kc5) 34... f3
35. b6 Rg8 $3 36. Kb4 $1 (36. a5 g3 37. hxg3 f2 38. Bg2 Rxg3+) 36... f2 37. Bg2
Ke6 38. Kb5 {etc. I admit my analysis is grossly inconclusive. The fact is, Hou
should have gone for this line.}) 25. b4 f5 26. Qd3 Bxc3 27. dxc3 Qd6 28. a4 a5
29. Kb3 Rb8 30. b5 Qc5 {[#] Having wasted some time Hou Yifan finds the
strength to admit her mistake and return to the correct plan of welcoming a
queen trade. Black can no longer win the game, but at least she won't lose.}
31. h4 Rbd8 32. h5 Kf6 33. hxg6 hxg6 34. Qe3 Qxe3 35. Rxe3 $11 Rd6 36. Re1 Rc8
{No path for the white king to support the pawns.} 37. Rh1 Kg7 38. Kc2 g5 39.
Rd1 Kf6 {Same thing here: Black has to stay put and prevent the white rook from
getting through.} 40. Kd3 Rb6 41. Rh1 Kg7 42. Rg1 Kf6 43. Ke3 Rd6 44. Rb1 Rb6
45. Ke2 Kg6 46. Kf2 Kf6 47. Rh1 Kg7 48. Re1 1/2-1/2
