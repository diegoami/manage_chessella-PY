Once again today he proved that. However, he will be upset he only finished with a half point since he had a winning position right out of the opening.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 {Karjakin is a firm adherent of Queen's Indian having more than 70 games with the black pieces in it.} 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 (5. Ne5) 5... Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Be7 7. Bg2 c6 8. Bc3 d5 9.

Nxd7 { White has to exchange the knights as the c4 pawn would otherwise be hanging.} Nxd7 11. Nd2 O-O 12. O-O Rc8 13.

Bb2 {Elajnov's first long think of the game - 20 minutes.} d4 $6 {Karjakin wasn't happy with a slightly inferior position out of the opening and wants to clarify the situation in the center. But in that process he miscalculates and ends up in a nearly lost position.} ( 17... Ne6 18. Rxc8 Bxc8 19. Nf3 Bb7 20. Nd4 $14 {is a stable edge for White.}) (17... Bf6 $5 {Would have been a very typical way of solving all the opening problems.} 18. Bxf6 Qxf6 19. Bxd5 (19.

First of all he might have been afraid that his back rank is a little weak plus his pieces look not so well co-ordinated.
