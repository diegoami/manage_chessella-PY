{With a large experience at top level chess after having played many Olympiads
and having met the likes of Vaganian or Shirov, the strongest Tunisian player
didn't find his best shape in the Rapid part. He had good positions but
converting them was not an easy road. It is thus remarkable that after having
scored 1 point out of 9 games, Slim cleaned the dust from his fall and raised
to a 5th position in the Blitz. In the following game though, El Adnani proved
too tricky!} 1. e4 c5 2. Ne2 Nc6 3. Nbc3 Nf6 4. g3 h5 5. h3 e5 6. Bg2 d6 7. d3
Be7 8. O-O Nd4 9. f4 {A closed Sicilian in which Black already said A by
pushing his pawn to h5. His next move signals 'B'.} h4 10. g4 Nxg4 11. hxg4
Bxg4 12. Kh2 exf4 {The position Mokliss must have envisioned when he went 9...
h4. White should indeed treat the position carefully here as things can easily
get out of control. What should White do next?} 13. Rxf4 (13. Bxf4 {is not the
answer either} g5 14. Be3 h3 15. Bh1 d5 $1 {with good compensation as Qd6+ is
incoming. Instead}) (13. Bh3 $1 {gives White a large advantage. If Black now
takes on h3 it would mean he loses his best attacking piece, but} Bh5 14. Qe1 {
reveals the other point behind White's 13th move. Here} Nf3+ ({but} 14... Nxc2
15. Qf2 Nxa1 16. Nxf4 {promises no easy life either.}) ({Maybe} 14... Nxe2 15.
Nxe2 g5 {is relatively best, when I like} 16. Nxf4 gxf4 17. Bxf4 {with
tremendous compensation.}) 15. Rxf3 Bxf3 16. Qf2 Bxe2 17. Qxe2 {is just
winning for White. He will easily block the king-side pawns before
infiltrating on the light squares.}) 13... Bh5 14. Be3 g5 15. Rf1 Bf6 {Black
has full compensation.} 16. Bxd4 cxd4 (16... Bxd4 $5) 17. Nd5 Be5+ {Where to?}
18. Kg1 ({The illogical looking} 18. Kh1 $1 {would allow White to meet} h3 {
with} 19. Bf3 g4 20. Ng3 $1 Bxg3 21. Bxg4 {when the tables would have turned.})
18... h3 19. Bxh3 ({Now} 19. Bf3 g4 20. Ng3 gxf3 21. Nxh5 Qg5+ $1 {is just
mate.}) 19... Bxe2 20. Qxe2 Rxh3 21. Rxf7 ({The curse of rapid is the lack of
time. Slim decided to go all in on f7 but the combination backfires. Instead} 
21. Rf3 {should give White excellent chances to hold. The knight on d5 is
phenomenal.}) 21... Rg3+ $1 ({This in between move ends the game,} 21... Kxf7
22. Qf1+ {was the point.}) 22. Kf2 Kxf7 23. Qh5+ Kg7 24. Rh1 Qh8 {Shutting the
door.} 25. Ne7 Qxh5 26. Rxh5 Rf8+ 27. Nf5+ Rxf5+ 28. exf5 g4 {White resigned.}

{The pride of Madagascar called tongue in cheek "the weakest strongest player
in the field" due to the serious gap between his classical rating and the
Rapid & Blitz ones, finished on a 4th position in the Rapid but got pulled
down in the subsequent Blitz event. Here Bassem poses his young Malagasy
opponent a problem that proves too hard to solve.} 20... Bxe4 21. Bd2 {Quo
Vadis?} Bc6 {The faster time controls obviously make for a lot of excitement
and little time to calculate.} (21... Bf5 $1 22. Qxe7 Qb5 {would have kept
Black in the game.}) 22. Qa7 $1 ({(} 22. Qa7 {) Now Fy realized that after} Qb5
23. Nc3 {it is his own bishop that blocks the road to freedom.}) 1-0

{Bassem decided the rapid part of the event with a model King's Indian game
against David Silva, the triple African junior champion and Angola's hope for
its upcoming future in chess. The Egyptian GM finished things off avec une
petite tactique.} 26. Bc3 {Back with the queen?} Bf3+ {No, and the following
line was sharply calculated by the tournament winner.} 27. Kh2 Bxe4 $1 28. Bxb4
