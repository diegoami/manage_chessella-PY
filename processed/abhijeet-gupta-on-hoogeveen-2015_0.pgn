Bh4 dxc4 7. e4 g5 8. Bg3 b5 {The Moscow Variation, one of the sharpest variations in current chess theory. Both the players are ready for a full-blooded fight.} 9. Be2 Bb7 (9... b4 { never really wins a pawn as after} 10. Na4 Nxe4 11. Be5 Nf6 (11... f6 12. Qc2 $1 $18) 12. Bxc4 $44 {White has excellent compensation.}) 10. Qc2 Nbd7 11. Nd2 {This move played by Abhijeet had been tried once before by Tomashevsky against Matlakov in 2014. However, the main move in the position is Rad1. The move Nd2 looks pretty artificial. Abhijeet's idea is to play Nf1-e3. But as we shall see it's too slow.} (11. Rd1 Qb6 12. h4 g4 13. Ne5 {is the main line.}) 11... Qb6 ({Tomashevsky-Matlakov game went} 11... h5 12. h4 g4 13. Rd1 Be7 14. Nf1 Nf8 15. Ne3 Ng6 16. O-O O-O 17. f3 $1 {When White had already snatched the initiative and stood better. 1-0 (65) Tomashevsky,E (2695)-Matlakov,M (2689) Vladivostok 2014}) 12. Rd1 Be7 (12... Qxd4 $2 13. Nxc4 $1 $18) 13. Nf1 $6 { This is logical continuation of 11.Nd2!?, but turns out that Black has a simple way to snatch the initiative.} (13. a4 a6 14. O-O {was more in the spirit of the position.}) 13... b4 $1 14. Na4 b3 $1 {[#]Strong play by Ankit. As Abhijeet said in his interview, he had underestimated this idea of b4-b3.} 15. Qd2 (15. axb3 Bb4+ 16. Nd2 cxb3 17. Qd3 Qb5 $15) 15... Qa6 16. axb3 Nxe4 17. Qc2 Qa5+ 18. Nd2 Nxg3 19. hxg3 cxb3 $17 {Through some excellent moves Black has cemented his advantage.} 20. Qxb3 Rb8 {The idea is to play c5 and then Bxg2, opening an attack against the queen.} 21. Qc2 c5 $1 {Once the bishop comes to life, Black usually equalizes. Here he is simply winning.} 22. d5 exd5 $19 {Black is two healthy pawns up and no matter how hard Gupta tries to complicate matters, Rajpara keeps things under control and brings home the full point.} 23. Nc3 Nf6 24. Qf5 Qb6 25. Kf1 Kf8 26. Re1 Bc8 27. Qc2 Qxb2 { There goes the third one.} 28. Qd3 c4 29. Qd4 Qb6 30. Qe5 Qd6 31. Qd4 Be6 32. f4 Kg7 33. Nf3 Qc5 34. Qd2 Ne4 35. Nxe4 dxe4 36. Nd4 c3 37. Nxe6+ fxe6 38. Qc2 Qd4 39. Rd1 Rb2 40. Qc1 Rd2 {Once White played this ultra ambitious idea of Nd2-f1 and Black executed the moves b4 followed by b3 there was no way that Abhijeet could have made a comeback in the game. His opponent played some flawless chess. It's always difficult to recover from such one-sided games, and the fact that Abhijeet won the tournament speaks volumes about his mental strength.} 0-1
