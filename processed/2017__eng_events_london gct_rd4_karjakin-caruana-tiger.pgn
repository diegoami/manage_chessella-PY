{After overcoming my initial impulse to comment on all the other games, I
finally settled on this one. The result did play a part in my decision.} 1. e4
c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 (5. Nb5 d6 6. c4 Nf6 7. N1c3 a6 {
leads to a Maroczy set-up.} 8. Na3) 5... Qc7 ({The main reason for Black's
move order is to avoid} 5... a6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. Bd3 d5 8. O-O {which leads to
a rather un-Sicilian position that demands a lot from a defensive point of
view.}) 6. Be3 ({For a while White scored well with} 6. Ndb5 Qb8 7. Be3 a6 8.

{, but I always considered this to be a bluff. Black should be winning and it
is a relief for me to see that White has scored horribly from this position in
the last year.}) 6... a6 7. Qf3 $5 {This move had popped up already in the
early 2000's, but didn't catch on until a decade later. Since then it has even
challenged 7.Qd2 for the prize of 'most popular' and it is easy to understand
its charm. The 7.Qd2-lines can be answered by one thousand sharp lines,
whereas here play becomes more linear and easier to remember. White will plonk
the queen down on g3 and take it from there.} (7. Qd2 Nf6 8. O-O-O {has been
played in a few thousand (not exaggerating this time) tournament games. Lately
Black has preferred} Be7 {to the alternatives. One critical line goes} 9. f3 b5

himself.}) 12... Nh5 13. Be5 Qxe5 14. Qxd7+ Kf8 15. Qxb7 Qb8 {and Black was
doing all right in - among others - Khairullin,I (2651)-Jumabayev,R (2564)

here:} (7... Nf6 8. O-O-O Ne5 9. Qg3 b5 10. f4 Neg4 11. Bg1 {leads to the game.

this position with White only a year ago:} 9. g3 $5 Nge7 10. Qe2 O-O 11. f4
Bxd4 12. Bxd4 Nxd4 13. Rxd4 e5 14. Rd1 exf4 15. e5 $1 {White has a strong
initiative and Black is struggling to find some coordination.} f3 16. Qxf3 Qxe5

8. Qg3 b5 $5 {This is a very rare move order.} ({Almost everyone and her uncle
plays} 8... h5 {when again we get a position with many possibilities. This is
one of the lovely side effects of playing the Taimanov Sicilian, instead of
any-other-Sicilian.} {The most common move here is} 9. O-O-O ({The game
Swiercz,D (2645)-Durarbayli,V (2605) 28th Carlos Torre Mem 2016, saw a ton of
preparation being meted out before things turned vague:} 9. Bf4 $5 d6 10. Bg5

dreaming about how nice it would have been to still be able to go to h6.} b5

Bg5-Najdorf where the h5-pawn has gone on a wild goose chase.}) 12. Bxh4 b4 (

me like 9.Bf4 is the more dangerous move.}) 9. O-O-O ({This time} 9. Bf4 d6 10.

excellent outposts.}) (12. Bd3 {is also critical:} Bb7 13. e5 (13. h3 $5 h4 14.

you are a fan of statistics then this is your choice. I am guessing Karjakin

is struggling to find a way to meet Nb6, while keeping Ne4 stable when Bd3
comes.}) 14. Nb3 {Karjakin's plan is to occupy the c5-square and - if Black is
not careful - perhaps even manage to exchange the dark squared bishops.

here.} ({Earlier games went} 14. h3 {and this seems like the better move.} Nh6

to be a questionable victory, but it was already too late to turn to other
plans. The Sicilian is an unforgiving opening for those who do not play the
best move; the difference between doing fine and being worse is often hard to
discern.} Bc6 $1 {Now Black is ready to continue with a6-a5-a4.} 16. Ne4 ({

that there are plenty of good moves that keep an advantage, while it is
difficult to see which move is best. In those situation it is generally a good
idea to play a good move.} Bd5 {...and this is a good move.} ({Perhaps} 24...

which is better and why.}) 25. Bg1 (25. Be3 Qh4 26. Qxh4 Nxh4 27. Nc5 a5 $17)
