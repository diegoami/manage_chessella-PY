00]} Bb4 {[%emt 0:04:48]} 5. g3 $5 {[%emt 0:01:05] An interesting line against
the Ragozin, taking the game into Catalan territory.} O-O {[%emt 0:01:17]} 6.

02:49] White doesn't really care about the c4 pawn much. He continues with his
development.} Rb8 {[%emt 0:19:43]} (10... Ng4 11. Bf4 $13) 11. Qe2 {[%emt 0:06:

[%emt 0:02:09] This was the move that Sambuev was very proud of. He starts to
create some pressure on his opponent with the idea of the pawn storm with g5
followed by f4.} Ne8 {[%emt 0:05:49]} (14... Nd7 $5 15. f4 f6 $15) 15. d5 {

continue with f4.} Bxd5 {[%emt 0:15:42]} (17... Bxg5 $5 18. Bxg5 Qxg5 19. Nd7

[%emt 0:01:48] Full credit to Sambuev for finding flaws in his opponent's
calculation.} Nd6 {[%emt 0:00:45]} 23. Bh3 {[%emt 0:00:45] The knight has been
stopped from coming to f5. Now Nf6+ is a big threat.} Rfd8 {[%emt 0:00:18]} 24.
Rd4 $1 {[%emt 0:00:58] The idea is just Rh4 and there is no good way to stop
it. Wei Yi had had enough.} 1-0
