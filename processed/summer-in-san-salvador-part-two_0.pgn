{Coming from a closer geographical area, the third prize winner Isan Ortiz
played a few full-blooded games, without fearing any possible dangers. White
has a space advantage and a nice centralized position, but this frequently
proves an illusion in the Sicilian. White decided he has enough positional
trumps to kick the irritating knight away with:} 20. b3 $2 {relying on 20...
Nxa3 21.Nf5! Qg5+ 22.Kb2 when the d6-pawn and the a3-knight are hanging. But he
overlooked the Zwischenzug} ({All pieces forward would have been, perhaps, a
better way to proceed:} 20. f4) 20... Qg5+ $1 {winning an essential tempo and
turning the tables around completely.} 21. Kb1 Nxa3+ 22. Ka2 b4 23. Na4 O-O 24.
c4 Qa5 {Black has won a pawn and later the game.} 0-1
