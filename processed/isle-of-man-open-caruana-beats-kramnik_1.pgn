to believe that Kramnik had an improvement prepared here? I believe so. }) 6...

12... a5 {This move and the next is the start of a cat and mouse game, where
Black is trying to give away as little information as possible, while
discouraging White from castling long, whereas White is trying to set the stage
for a good moment to do just that.} 13. a3 (13. g4 Nf6 14. Ng3 c5 $1 { as in

natural move is the right one, but the timing is wrong:} ({The engine suggests}

improvement.}) (21. Nc3 b5 22. Ne2 b4 23. a4 b3 $1 {With the idea of ...Rb4})
