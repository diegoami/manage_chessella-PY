Nc3 Ne7 11. h3 Ng6 12. b3 Be7 13. Bb2 h5 14. Ne4 {This is well known and Bologan himself had a game against Aronian which went 14...h4 in 2012. But here the Hungarian comes up with a new move.} a5 $5 {This doesn't really change the character of the play but forces Viktor to think over the board and come up with some moves.} 15.

Re1 $18 { White is two pawns up and he is not intending to return any one of them. The rest of the game is interesting if you would like to improve your chess technique, but from the objective stand point White is already winning.} Rc6 42. Re4 a4 43. Ke2 a3 44. g4 Rb6 45.
