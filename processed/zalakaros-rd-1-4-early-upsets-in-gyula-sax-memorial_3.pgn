Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 c5 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 g6 6. O-O Bg7 7. Nc3 { White has chosen to control the center with only his pieces, involving no pawns, much like Richard Reti.} O-O 8. Re1 d5 9. Nb3 d4 10. Na4 e5 {Black has occupied the center with his pawns, White with his pieces. The typical motif is to start putting pressure on these advanced pawns.} 11. c3 Re8 (11... dxc3 12. Nxc3 Bf5 {would be very close to equal, but White may still have a teeny tiny edge.}) 12. cxd4 exd4 13. Nac5 {A very interesting middlegame has arisen. The fundamental difference is in the pawn structure, especially the pawn on d4. This pawn gives Black space and exerts control. However, it is also vulnerable to being attacked. The knight on c5 along with the bishop on g2 exerts unpleasant pressure.} Ng4 14. h3 Nge5 15. e3 {So far, White has played by the textbook} Qe7 $2 (15... dxe3 $142 16. Bxe3 Qxd1 17. Raxd1 b6 18. Nd3 {puts Black under unpleasant pressure. Black has a few tactical ways to relieve his pressure, for example, Bxh3 here, however, it's hard to calculate this and evaluate accurately from 3 moves prior.}) 16. Bd2 $1 {Black's position prima facie seems alright, but he has already landed himself in a soup.} d3 (16... dxe3 17. Rxe3) 17. Rc1 Rd8 {loses a pawn, but it's already hard to give Black good advice.} 18. f4 Nd7 19. Nxd3 Nf6 20. Ndc5 {back to his favourite square.} Rb8 21. Qe2 b6 {finally Black gets rid of this irksome knight, but at what cost?} 22. Na6 Bxa6 23. Qxa6 Ne4 24. Bxe4 Qxe4 25. Qc4 Qxc4 26. Rxc4 Ne7 27. Bc3 b5 28. Rc5 Bxc3 29. Rxc3 {A comfortable pawn up.} Nd5 30. Rd3 Nb4 31. Rxd8+ Rxd8 32. a3 Nc6 33. Kf2 b4 34. a4 Rd3 35. Nc5 Rd2+ 36. Re2 Rd1 37. Rc2 Na5 38. Kf3 Rf1+ 39. Ke4 Ra1 40. g4 h6 41. Ke5 Kg7 42. f5 Nc6+ 43. Kd6 Na5 44. Nd7 {A near flawless performance. White displayed a high level of positional understanding and a very mature play. Wow!} 1-0
