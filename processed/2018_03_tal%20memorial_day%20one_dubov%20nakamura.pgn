{I would say that this is the game of the day. Nakamura is always well
prepared in the opening, and Dubov managed to trick him with some very nice
ideas that he had prepared at home. At some point Dubov had 26 minutes on his
clock while Naka was struggling below ten minutes!} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4
d5 4. e5 d4 5. exf6 dxc3 6. bxc3 Qxf6 7. d4 e5 {I have always found this line
to be exciting. It is a clash of styles. White is aiming at speedy development
while Black wants a perfect structure. It all boils down to whether White can
damage Black in the opening. From how things progressed in this game, it was
White who used his trumps better.} 8. Nf3 Nc6 9. Be2 {This has not been played
by any GM above the rating of 2508. So this is sure that Dubov had worked out
things on his own at home.} (9. Bg5 {is more common.}) 9... exd4 10. Bg5 Qg6
11. O-O $1 {Black is not allowed to develop his bishop on b4 with a tempo.} (
11. cxd4 {is normal, but then you are not playing in the spirit of the
position.} Bb4+ 12. Bd2 O-O {And the position remains complex, but Black
shouldn't be complaining too much.}) 11... dxc3 {Hikaru thought for a few
seconds and took the pawn. He was clearly recalling his preparation.} 12. Bd3
Qd6 13. Re1+ Be7 14. c5 $1 {As mentioned by Hikaru's second Kris Littejohn,
this move was something that he hadn't considered in his preparation.} Qxc5 15.
Bxe7 Nxe7 16. Re5 {White is three pawns down, but he has some amazing bit of
activity going his way.} Qd6 17. Bb5+ Kf8 (17... Bd7 18. Bxd7+ Qxd7 (18... Kxd7
19. Qa4+ $18) 19. Qxd7+ Kxd7 20. Rd1+ $16) 18. Qe2 {Dubov was still blitzing
out his moves.} f6 (18... Be6 19. Ng5 $16) 19. Rd1 (19. Re3 {looks possible.}
Bd7 20. Bxd7 (20. Rd1 Bxb5 $19) 20... Qxd7 21. Rd1 Nd5 {looks fine for Black.})
19... fxe5 20. Nxe5 $1 {A very strong move. The queen cannot move because of
mate on d8.} Bf5 21. Rxd6 cxd6 22. Nd7+ Kf7 23. Qc4+ Be6 24. Qf4+ Nf5 (24...
Kg8 25. Qxd6 $16) 25. g4 {The knight is lost, but the one on d7 is also
trapped.} Rad8 $2 (25... Rhd8 26. gxf5 Bxd7 27. Bc4+ $16) (25... c2 $5 26. gxf5
Bd5 {Black somehow survives here.}) (25... Rhc8 26. gxf5 Bxd7 27. Bxd7 c2 28.
Be6+ Ke8 29. Bxc8 Rxc8 30. Qc1 Kf7 $11 {This cannot be won by White.}) 26. gxf5
Bxd7 27. Bc4+ (27. Qc4+ $1 {was much more accurate.} Ke7 28. Qh4+ $1 {This
check is easy to miss.} Ke8 29. Qh5+ Ke7 30. Qg5+ Ke8 (30... Kf7 31. Bc4+ Kf8
32. Qxd8+) 31. Qxg7 $18) 27... d5 $1 {Hikaru was low on time but finds the
trickiest defence. The position is still lost, but Dubov has to be very alert.}
(27... Kf6 28. Qd4+ Kxf5 29. Qd5+ {This check is very strong. With the bishop
on d5, the co-ordination is ruined.}) 28. Bxd5+ Kf6 29. Qd6+ Kxf5 30. Bc4 Rhe8
31. Bd3+ Kg5 32. h4+ (32. f4+ Kg4 33. Qd5 $18) 32... Kh5 33. Qg3 Bg4 34. f3 $1
Rd4 35. Kf2 c2 36. Bxc2 {Over here Naka thought for a while, shook his head
and before he could make his next move, his flag fell. The position is already
lost. Rf8 is met with Qe5+ and the rook is lost.} Rf8 1-0
