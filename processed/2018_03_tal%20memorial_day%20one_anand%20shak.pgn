1. e4 e6 {One of the main things Shak has to do is conceal his preparation for
the Candidates. Something new has to be played and he decides to go for the
French.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Ba5 $5 6. b4 cxd4 7. Nb5 Bc7 8. f4
Bd7 9. Nxc7+ Qxc7 10. Nf3 Ba4 11. Ra2 $6 {This move has been played in four
games, but not by any strong players. Better was surely either Bb2 or Bd3.} (
11. Bd3 Qc3+ 12. Bd2 Qxd3 13. cxd3 Bxd1 14. Kxd1 $14 {This is a great position
for White as he places his king on e2 and captures the c-file with his rooks.})

) 11... Ne7 12. Nxd4 a6 13. Be3 Nbc6 14. Bd3 Nxd4 15. Bxd4 Bb5 $1 {Black has
solved all his opening problems. This is usually the problem piece in the
French. But with this move he has been able to exchange it off.} 16. O-O Nf5
17. Bf2 h5 18. a4 Bxd3 19. cxd3 {This position is obectively equal, but in
Rapid, it is just easier for Black to play. He has the c-file and the knight
on f5 is powerfully placed.} Rc8 20. a5 d4 $1 21. Ra1 Qd7 22. Qf3 Qd5 (22...
Rc3 23. Rac1 O-O $1 {The h5 pawn is not so important. Getting control of the
c-file is.}) 23. Qxd5 exd5 24. Rfc1 Kd7 25. Be1 f6 26. exf6 gxf6 {Black pawns
are in a mess, but his pieces control all the strategic points.} 27. Kf2 Ne3
28. Kf3 Nc2 29. Ra2 Nxe1+ $1 {This is what Mamedyarov is all about. He is
flexible and he gives up his knight for the bishop. It's not like he clings on
to his advantage. He quickly switches from one to the other.} 30. Rxe1 Rc3 31.
Rae2 $6 {Vishy as always goes for activity. But perhaps it was better to just
defend the d3 pawn.} (31. Rd2 Rb3 32. f5 Rxb4 33. Re6 Rf8 34. Kg3 Rb5 35. Kh4
Rxa5 36. Kxh5 $16 {This is going to be race, but it seems as if White is the
one who is faster here.}) 31... Rxd3+ 32. Kf2 Rh7 33. b5 axb5 34. Rb2 Kc6 35.
Re6+ Kc5 36. Rb6 Ra3 37. Rxf6 {Vishy takes the f-pawn and hopes that his
f-pawn would be faster than Black d-pawn but it doesn't turn out that way.} (
37. R2xb5+ Kc4 38. Rb4+ Kc3 $19 {The king is just getting too active.}) 37...

44. Rd1 Kd3 {Step by step, Mamedyarov has used his king to great effect.} 45.
Re6 d4 46. f6 Ra3 $1 {One may argue that it was too early to resign, but it
wasn't.} (46... Ra3 47. Re7 (47. Kf2 Kc2 48. Ke2 d3+ $19) 47... Rxe7 48. fxe7
