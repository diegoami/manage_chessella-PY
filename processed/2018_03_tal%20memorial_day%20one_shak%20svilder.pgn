1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bg5 Bg7 4. Nbd2 c5 5. e3 cxd4 6. exd4 b6 7. c3 O-O 8.
Bd3 Ba6 9. Bxa6 Nxa6 10. Qe2 Nc7 11. h4 $5 {Typical Mamedyarov. Normal players
would 0-0, Mamedyarov goes for an attack.} b5 12. h5 b4 (12... Nxh5 13. Bxe7
$16) 13. hxg6 hxg6 14. c4 {White has a very nice position here. He has the
central pawns and the open h-file. He can even just 0-0-0 and then launch an
attack on the kingside.} Ne6 15. Be3 d5 16. c5 Ne4 {Svidler understands the
need to be as active as possible and he tries his best to unsettle the play.}
17. O-O-O f5 $2 {Svidlers idea is to play f4 at some point and create pressure
on the d4 pawn. But this loses tactically.} (17... Qc7 18. Kb1 Nc3+ $5 {
This works well now.} 19. bxc3 bxc3 20. Nb3 a5 {Black is the one who has made
inroads in the position.}) (17... Nc3 $6 18. bxc3 bxc3 19. Nb3 a5 20. Rd3 a4
21. Na1 $18 {White will round up the c3 pawn and be just better.}) 18. Nxe4 $1
fxe4 (18... dxe4 19. Qc4 Qc8 20. Ng5 $18) 19. Ne5 Rf6 (19... Bxe5 20. dxe5 $18)
(19... Nxc5 20. Nxg6 Nd3+ 21. Kb1 Rf6 22. Qh5 $18 {The attack on the king is
decisive.}) 20. Qg4 Nf8 21. Bh6 Bxh6+ 22. Rxh6 Qc8 23. Qh4 {It was a very
short and unusual game. Svidler with his great chess sense would always smell
such attacks in advance, but in this case it turned out that he was not in the
best frame of mind, and Mamedyarov's attack crashed through.} 1-0
