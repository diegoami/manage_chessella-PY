Bxe6 {was Topalov's twist against Svidler at the Sinquefield Cup, but 11.Nbd2 remains by far as the main move.}) 11... Bxb3 {Svidler chooses a move that is not as common as 11...Qc8 or 11...Rb8, but certailny deserves attention.} 12. Nxb3 Re8 13. h3 h6 14. Nh4 $5 {an interesting juncture. White is daring Black to capture on e4.} (14. d4 { was Anand-Adams from 2006.}) 14... Bf8 (14... Nxe4 15. Nf5 (15. Rxe4 Bxh4 16.

Bg5 {with pressure on the kingside, even though White's advantage isn't decisive my any means.}) 16. Qg4 $5 {And Black has to be very careful. Again it is possible that the attack is not as serious as it looks, but Black must be incredibly accurate and at best he reaches an equal position.}) 15. Nf5 Ne7 16. Ne3 Qd7 17. Ng4 Nh7 (17... Nxg4 18. hxg4 {is slightly better for White, who can break on g5 when he wants to.}) 18. d4 (18. Nd2 $5 {and maneuvering the knight back ot the kingside was also worthy of attention.} f5 $5) 18... exd4 19. Nxd4 c5 20.

Qxe4 Rxe4 { A nice defense so far by Svidler, really avoiding any major problems. The endgame is close to equal, but still a bit more pleasant for White due to the passive position of the bishop on f8 and how easily attackable d5 and d6 are.} 28. Rd1 Rae8 29.
