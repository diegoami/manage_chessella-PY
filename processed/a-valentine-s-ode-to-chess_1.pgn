Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 c6 {The Slav Defence} 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. e3 {This is currently regarded as a harmless sideline.} (5. a4 {preventing...b5 is the Main Line.}) 5... b5 6. a4 b4 7. Na2 {Attacking both pawns.} e6 8. Bxc4 a5 { Seeking complications at the cost of development} (8... Be7 {is preferable. However, Black has other plans for the bishop.}) 9. O-O Bd6 $2 {A flawed idea. If White can advance e3-e4, both the bishop and the knight would be in danger.} (9... Be7 {is still playable.}) 10. Qc2 Ng4 $2 {This move with the idea of provoking h2-h3 is unsound.} (10... O-O {is necessary.}) 11. h3 $2 {And Alekhine falls for it.} ({After} 11. e4 $1 {threatening e5 Black is busted. Both his bishop and knight would be turned back.}) 11... h5 $1 {Of course!} 12. e4 (12. hxg4 $4 hxg4 $19 {is out of question.}) 12... Nh6 {Developing cold feet.} (12... Nd7 {is a useful option.}) ({So is} 12... Bb7 {though both would have failed in the long run.}) 13. Bg5 Be7 14. Bxe7 {This move simplifies the position a bit.} (14. Be3 {would have preserved tension.}) 14... Qxe7 15. Nc1 $1 {White rightly brings the knight into play.} g5 {Rushing headlong into attack.} ({Instead he should have played} 15... Nd7 {first.}) 16. e5 {In a simultaneous display the visiting master hardly has time and patience to think and calculate. He is in a hurry to move on. That alone explains the oversight here.} ({In a normal tournament game he would have played the stronger} 16. Ne5 $1 {with an overwhelming position.}) 16... g4 17. Nd2 gxh3 18. Ne4 $2 {This move gives Black more counterplay.} (18. g3 {looks dangerous, but it is safe.} h4 ({Or} 18... h2+ 19. Kxh2 h4 20. Ne4 hxg3+ 21. fxg3 Ng4+ 22. Kg1 Rh2 23. Qd3 {and White soon repulses Black's attacking forces.}) 19. Ne4 hxg3 20. fxg3 { and soon the Black king would be on the run.}) 18... hxg2 $17 19. Nf6+ $2 { It's hard to believe that this "obvious" move loses.} (19. Kxg2 {preparing to move to safety with Kf3 and Ke2 was the lesser evil.}) 19... Kd8 20. Kxg2 Nd7 $1 $19 {Now the White knight on f6 cannot hold on to his post.} 21. Nxh5 { Playing with fire. But other moves also lost.} ({If} 21. Ne4 Qh4 22. Kf3 Nf5 $19) 21... Qg5+ 22. Ng3 Nf5 23. Qe4 Bb7 {This is not bad.} ({But} 23... Rh4 $1 {is decisive.} 24. Qd3 ({Or} 24. Qxc6 $4 Ra7 {and Black wins with the threat of 25...Bb7, trapping the queen.}) 24... Rxd4 $19) 24. Nce2 Kc7 25. Rh1 Nb6 ({ More forcing is} 25... c5 $1 $19) 26. Rxh8 Rxh8 27. Rc1 Nxg3 28. fxg3 c5 29. d5 exd5 30. Bxd5 Qxc1 $1 31. Bxb7 Qh1+ 32. Kf2 Qxe4 {Simplifying into a won endgame.} ({Stronger is} 32... Rh2+ $1 33. Ke3 Qxe4+ 34. Bxe4 Nc4+ 35. Kd3 Nxb2+ $19) 33. Bxe4 Nxa4 {This move allows a slight flicker of resistance.} ({ After} 33... c4 $1 {it's curtains.}) 34. b3 $1 {Trust, Alekhine to fight till the end.} Nb6 35. Nf4 Re8 (35... c4 $19 {is also good.}) 36. Nd5+ Nxd5 37. Bxd5 Rxe5 0-1
