1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Bd7 4. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {Less popular than the queen
recapture, though it is not clear to me quite why.} 5. O-O Ngf6 (5... g6 {
was the move I tried in one outing against one of the players currently in
Wijk:} 6. c3 Ngf6 7. Re1 Ne5 $6 {A typical idea, but White is not obliged to
take by any means! My opponent acheived an advantage but then lost it at some
later point:} 8. d4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Nxf3+ 10. Qxf3 Bg7 11. e5 dxe5 12. dxe5 Nd5
13. Rd1 e6 14. Nc3 O-O 15. Nxd5 exd5 16. Rxd5 Qb6 17. h4 $6 Rad8 $11 {Jones,
G-Fernandez,D London 2016}) 6. Qe2 (6. Re1 e6 7. c3 Be7 8. d4 O-O 9. Bg5 h6 10.
Bxf6 Bxf6 11. Na3 cxd4 12. cxd4 Nb6 $11 {failed to acheive anything much in
Vachier Lagrave,M-Nakamura,H Palma de Mallorca 2017}) 6... Qc7 7. Rd1 (7. c3 {
is main and we can only assume from his later play that Black wanted} e6 8. d4
Be7 $11 {or similar, with a fairly solid position and completion of
development one move away for both sides.}) 7... e6 8. d4 (8. c4 $5 {was the
logical way to implement a 'light square only' pawn structure. To avoid being
slightly worse, Black has to make a tough strategic call between ...e5 and ...
Ne5.}) 8... cxd4 9. Nxd4 (9. Rxd4 $5 {merited consideration, still trying to
set up with c4, e.g.} Rc8 10. Na3 Be7 11. Rc4 Qb8 12. Rxc8+ Qxc8 13. c4 $132)
9... Rc8 {A nice point. Now White would really rather not play Nc3, so his
options are limited.} 10. Nb5 (10. b3 $5 {This leads to the setup White wanted,
he just has to see that ...e5 is not favourable.} a6 (10... e5 11. Nb5 Qxc2 12.
Qxc2 Rxc2 13. N1a3 $14) 11. c4 Be7 12. Bb2 $11) 10... Qxc2 11. Qxc2 Rxc2 12.
N1a3 Rc8 13. Nxa7 Rd8 14. N7b5 (14. f3 d5 $17) 14... Nxe4 15. f3 Nef6 16. Nxd6+
Bxd6 17. Rxd6 Ke7 18. Rd4 Ne5 19. Be3 Nc6 (19... Nd5 {is a bit more ambitious;
Black's minor pieces are probably slightly better placed so he should think
about fighting for an advantage.}) 20. Rxd8 Rxd8 21. Bc5+ Kd7 22. Nc4 Nd5 23.
a4 {Whereas in this version, White' bishop has become active so although Black
may still be optically for choice, there decidedly isn't an edge unless White
messes up.} e5 24. a5 Ke6 (24... f6 {is more patient and keeps open knight
re-routings starting with ...Nc7, but should objectively also be nothing.}) 25.
a6 bxa6 26. Rxa6 Kd7 27. b4 {A final simplifying combination.} Ndxb4 28. Bxb4
Nxb4 29. Rd6+ Ke7 30. Rxd8 Kxd8 31. Nxe5 1/2-1/2
