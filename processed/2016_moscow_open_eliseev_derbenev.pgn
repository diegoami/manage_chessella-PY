1. e4 a6 2. d4 c5 3. d5 d6 4. c4 b5 5. cxb5 g6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. a4 {An
unorthodox opening led Black to sacrifice a pawn in Wolga-Benko-Gambit fashion.
But as he never gets adequate compensation for his pawn he soon seeks to stir
up trouble.} Ngf6 9. Ra3 O-O 10. Qc2 e6 11. dxe6 fxe6 12. e5 Ng4 {Offering a
piece sacrifice.} 13. Bg5 {Which White declines.} ({But the engines see
nothing wrong for White after} 13. Qe4 Ndxe5 14. Qxa8 Nxf3+ 15. gxf3 Ne5 16. f4
) 13... Qa5 14. exd6 Bd4 15. Bh4 {[#]} Rxf3 {Continuing in style. But if White
keeps his cool he should win.} 16. gxf3 Bb7 17. Be2 Nge5 18. O-O Bxf3 19. Ne4
Rf8 20. Bxf3 Nxf3+ {[#]} 21. Rxf3 {White shows that he, too, does not mind a
little sacrifice now and then and gives some of his material back to repel
Black's attack and attack himself.} Rxf3 22. Qc4 h6 23. Qxe6+ Rf7 24. Be7 Nf8
25. Bxf8 Kxf8 26. Qc8+ Kg7 27. d7 Rf8 28. Nd6 Rxf2 {One final trick. Of course,
White cannot take the rook because after 29.Rxf2 he will be mated with 29...
Qe1+. But after} 29. Ne8+ Kh7 30. d8=Q {Black's tricks came to an end. After,
for instance, 30...Rf8+ White takes the bishop with 31.Qxd4! and after a few
more moves Black will be mated.} 1-0
