{The most important duel of the Challengers section was between Adhiban and
Dreev in the seventh round. Both of them were leading the tournament with 5.0/
6. The Indian player having the white pieces made full use of that fact.} 1. d4
d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 {Dreev is a big expert in the Meran System and
has written a book on it as well.} 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Qc2 b6 {This move is a Dreev
speciality and he has employed it on 43 occassions with 11 wins and 5 losses.
Knowing how well Adhiban prepares, we can be sure he came to the game doing his
homework.} (6... Bd6 {is the main move in the position by a overwhelming margin
and nearly 19,000 games have been played with that move.}) 7. Bd3 Bb7 8. O-O
Be7 9. b3 dxc4 10. bxc4 c5 {Nothing new under the sun. Everything has been
played before.} 11. d5 $5 {An interesting pawn sacrifice that is aimed at
taking advantage of the black king who hasn't castled yet. Of course this is
not new for Dreev who has faced it against Huzman, Sargissian, Miljkovic and
Zviaginsev.} exd5 12. cxd5 Nxd5 13. Nxd5 Bxd5 14. Rd1 Bf6 15. e4 $5 $146
{Adhiban made this move instantly which meant that he was completely prepared.
This is a novelty and not one of engine's top suggestions. The Indian GM had
prepared this position deeply and came to the conclusion that e3-e4 is an
excellent practical move. But Dreev's next move must have come as a surprise to
him.} c4 $5 (15... Bxa1 {Why can't this rook be taken is the logical question.}
16. exd5 $13 {And you cannot 0-0 because the h7 pawn is hanging. At the same
time Re1+ is threatened. Objectively the position could be equal but
practically it is extremely dangerous for Black. And trying it out against a
well prepared opponent is not such a great idea.}) 16. Be2 $5 { Practically
this is also a good move. Now the bishop is hanging on d5 and also e4-e5 is
threatened. So the a1 rook has to be taken.} (16. Bxc4 {would have given White
a clear edge. Adhiban could have been worried about} Bxc4 {And now taking on c4
is bad because of Bxa1 when the e-file has not been opened. But here White has
a strong move -} 17. e5 $1 Nxe5 (17... Be6 18. exf6 Qxf6 19. Ba3 $1 $16
{Stopping 0-0}) 18. Rxd8+ Rxd8 19. Nxe5 Bxe5 20. Bg5 Bxa1 21. Bxd8 Be6 22. Bc7
$16 {When White is clearly better.}) 16... Bxa1 17. Rxd5 {There is no time to
0-0 for Black.} Qc7 (17... O-O $2 18. Qd1 $1 $16) 18. Ba3 $1 {The bishop makes
a wonderful entry in to the position.} Bf6 19. Bxc4 {The threat now is to put
additional pressure on d7 knight by means of Qa4 and Bb5.} Be7 20. Qa4 $1 Bxa3
$2 {The final mistake.} (20... a6 {was necessary.} 21. Re5 $1 O-O 22. Rxe7
{Looks pretty depressing for Black but he can fight on with} b5 23. Qd1 bxc4
24. Rxd7 Rfd8 $1 25. Rd5 $1 $16 {White is better but it is not clear whether
the advantage is decisive.}) 21. Rxd7 $1 Qxd7 22. Bb5 Qxb5 (22... O-O-O 23.
Bxd7+ Rxd7 {Could have been an option but it fails to} 24. Ne5 $1 Rd2 25. g3 $1
Bc5 26. Qc6+ Kb8 27. Nd7+ Rxd7 28. Qxd7 $18 {When the win is not at all
difficult to achieve.}) 23. Qxb5+ Kf8 24. Qb3 $1 {Dreev resigned the game as
the bishop moving back is met either with Ng5 or Ne5 and the f7 pawn cannot be
defended. What a beautiful piece of opening preparation by Adhiban. And that
was followed by some explosive middlegame chess. No wonder he is one of the
best upcoming talents in the country!} 1-0
