Qc2 c6 9. Rc1 b6 10. a4 Ne4 11. Be1 a5 {[#] The board is still full, the
tension unresolved - much can still happen. But for now both players have developed their pieces well and the position is
balanced.} 12. Nbd2 Nxd2 13. Nxd2 Bf6 14. cxd5 cxd5 15. e4 {[#] Grischuk
starts a plan for activity...} Bxd4 16. Nb3 Bf6 17. exd5 exd5 18.
Bxd5 Ra7 {[#] ... but only a symmetrical, tension-free position
has emerged, and barring an unlikely blunder, we're heading for a draw.} 19. Bg2 h6 20. Bc3 {Quite interesting maybe
the fact that the computer considers this position "0.00" from now until the very end of the game.} Rc7 21. Bxf6 Rxc2 22. Bxd8 Rxc1+ 23. Rxc1 Rxd8
