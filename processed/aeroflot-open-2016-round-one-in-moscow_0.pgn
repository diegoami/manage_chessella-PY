1. c4 g6 2. e4 e5 3. d4 Nf6 4.
Nf3 exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. Qxd4 Bb4+ {Up until this point we have seen many
top level encounters. Mainly White opted for the move Nbd2 in this position,
but Potkin wants to show that the knight on e4 is not so well placed and
hence refrains from exchanging it.} 7. Kd1 $5 {Although this looks like
a crazy move, it is not a novelty as it has been played before in the
game between Tamir Nabaty and Alexander Fier in 2015.} f5 8. exf6 Nxf6
9. Qh4 (9. Bh6 {was played by Nabaty.}) 9... d5 $1 {With the king on d1,
opening the position is of course the right decision.} 10. Bg5 Be7 (10...
O-O { was also possible.}) 11. cxd5 Nxd5 (11... Qxd5+ 12. Kc1 {Followed
by Nc3 gives White free flowing development and the king is quite safe
on c1.}) 12. Bc4 $1 { The king is right opposite the black queen, and
Black can choose how he would like to give a discovered check. But there
is just no good way to take advantage of this fact.} Nc6 (12... Nb6+ 13.
Kc1 Nxc4 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Re1 $16 ) 13. Bxd5 $6 {White goes wrong.} (13.
Nbd2 $1 $16) 13... Be6 $6 {Just shows how difficult it is to be accurate
in chess.} (13... Qxd5+ 14. Kc1 Qc5+ 15. Nc3 O-O $17 {Would have given
Black a clear edge.}) 14. Bxe7 Nxe7 15. Re1 $1 Bxd5 16. Kc2 Qd7 17. Nc3
Qf5+ $6 (17... Bxf3 18. gxf3 Qf5+ 19. Re4 g5 20. Qh5+ Kf8 21. h4 $16 {is
also clearly in White's favour.}) 18. Kc1 O-O-O 19. Rxe7 { Wei Yi must
have hoped to get some counterplay going here, but unfortunately he is
just lost.} Bxf3 20. gxf3 Qxf3 21. Qg3 $1 {The mate on c7 repels Black's
attack.} Qc6 22. Kc2 {The rest is just agony.} Rd6 23. Rae1 Rhd8 24. R1e2
a5 25. Qe5 {A very interesting and unbalanced game and some very interesting
opening preparation shown by Potkin.} 1-0
