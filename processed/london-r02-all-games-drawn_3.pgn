        as the c8 bishop cannot be developed for the time being. However, Black 
        can easily solve the problem either with Rb8 or, as Anand does in the 
        game, Nd6.} Nd6 19. Qb4 Be6 20. Re1 $6 {Aronian would like to play e3-e4 
        but he removes the pressure from the b7 pawn. This helps Anand to exchange 
        the key bishops.} (20. Ne5 {was much better keeping a minute edge.}) 20...
