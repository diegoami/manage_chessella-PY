{This is not such a huge
upset as Yuffa is just 150 points lower rated than Bologan. However,
considering
that Viktor was in excellent form at the recently concluded European Team
Championships it is surely a great result for the Russian youngster.}
1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 dxc4 {Taking the pawn before White has played
Nf3 is not so common but this totally playable.} 4. e4 b5 5. a4 b4 6.
Nb1 Nf6 7. e5 Nd5 8. Bxc4 e6 9. Nf3 Be7 10. O-O Bb7 11. Nbd2 Nd7 12. Ne4
{White's position is quite pleasant. His next plan is to play Bg5 and
exchange the dark squared bishops so that the d6 and c5 squares are weakened.
Bologan prevents it but loses further time.} h6 13. a5 $1 {Threatening
to gain more space with a6.} Rc8 14. Bxd5 $1 {A very anti-intuitive decision,
but all will be clear pretty soon.} cxd5 15. Nd6+ $1 Bxd6 16. exd6 {The
d6 pawn is pretty weak and most probably will be lost, but while it is
alive it causes quite some inconvenience to Black. The b4 pawn is also
weak and can be attacked by Qa4 and Bd2. On the other hand the b7 bishop
is pretty passive. All this leads to quite a strong initiative for White.}
Ba6 17. Re1 O-O 18. Bd2 $1 Rb8 19. Ne5 $1 {Threatening a fork on c6.}
Nxe5 20. dxe5 $16 {[%csl Gd6,Ge5] The d6 pawn which looked weak has now
transformed itself into a pillar of strength.} f5 21. Qh5 Kh7 22. Rac1
Rb7 (22... Qxa5 23. Rc7 $1 $18) 23. Rc5 $1 { Threatening to double the
rooks on the c-file.} b3 24. h4 $1 {I quite like this move, as Bg5 can
be played and back rank threats are no longer a problem.} Bb5 25. Bg5
(25. Rec1 {was objectively stronger.}) 25... Qxa5 26. Rec1 Qb4 27. Rc7
Rxc7 $2 (27... Bd7 {Blocking the rooks action on the seventh rank was
important.} 28. Rxb7 Qxb7 29. Rc7 Qb5 $16 {Black is still in the game.})
28. Rxc7 Qe1+ 29. Kh2 Qxe5+ 30. f4 $1 {Nicely calculated by Daniil. The
d6 pawn is taboo.} Qd4 (30... Qxd6 31. Qxh6+ $1) 31. Qxh6+ $1 {It's surprising
that Viktor allowed this, but there was really no way to prevent it.}
Kg8 32. Qxe6+ Kh8 33. Qe5 {The safest route to victory.} Qxe5 34. fxe5
Re8 35. Be7 d4 36. d7 Bxd7 37. Rxd7 d3 38. Bb4 {A very strong game by
Daniil Yuffa who surprisingly is not even a GM yet. But by the looks of
his play I am sure that he will be one pretty soon.} 1-0
