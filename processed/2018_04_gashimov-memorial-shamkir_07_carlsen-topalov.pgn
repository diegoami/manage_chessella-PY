{As usual for a Carlsen game, the following was not played on the cutting edge
of modern theory, so we can avoid stressing ourselves out before about move 15.
} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e3 (4. g3 {is the 'main' move but it is
important not to forget about the text, or even the slightly offbeat 4.a3.
After this, however, a surprising number of my recent conversations have dealt
with the line} Bb4 5. Nd5 $5 {which I expect to become a new fashion in the
sub-elite group.}) 4... Bb4 5. Qc2 Bxc3 (5... O-O {The text is obviously not a
bad move, but I would prefer to keep the
bishop-pair for now.} 6. Nd5 Re8 {and now:} 7. Bd3 {The most solid alternative.
} (7. Qf5 {is risky, and may not promise anything. Black can choose between
solid or gambit.} d6 (7... Be7 $5 8. Nxe5 Nb4 9. Nxb4 Bxb4 10. Nf3 d5 11. Qd3
Bg4 $44 {gave Black acceptable compensation, especially for rapid, in Howell,
D-Kryvoruchko,Y Riadh 2017}) 8. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {The solid approach.} (8... gxf6 9.
Qh5 d5 $132 {can also be played after analysis, e.g. Nepomniachtchi,I-Karjakin,
S chess.com INT 2017}) 9. Qxf6 gxf6 10. a3 Bc5 11. b4 Bb6 12. Bb2 a5 13. b5 Ne7
14. d4 a4 $5 $132 (14... Ng6 15. a4 $14 {was an edge for White in the game
that set this all off, i.e. Grischuk,A-Giri,A Elancourt 2013})) 7... h6 8. a3 (
8. O-O $5 a5 9. Nxf6+ Qxf6 10. Bh7+ Kh8 11. Be4 {seems a tad better to me-
White is able to economise on a3. Perhaps he thought that after} Bf8 {he would
want it anyway, but it is also perfectly fine to play} 12. b3 Nb4 13. Qd1 {
, when the natural} c6 $6 14. Bb2 d5 {turns out not to be that great after} 15.
Bb1 $14 {.}) 8... Bf8 9. O-O d6 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Be4 a5 12. b3 g6 13. Bb2 Bg7
(13... Bf5 $5 {improves; the usually-dubious structure after} 14. Bxf5 Qxf5 15.
Qxf5 gxf5 16. Nh4 Ne7 {is actually fine here due to the resource} 17. f4 e4 18.
Bf6 Bg7 $11) 14. Rae1 Qd8 (14... Bf5 {is good again}) 15. d4 $1 $14 {
Nepomniachtchi,I-Karjakin,S chess.com INT 2017}) 6. bxc3 d6 7. e4 {Here this
is clearly the best way to fix the structure, either immediately or after a
preliminary d3.} O-O 8. g3 Ne8 9. Nh4 {As a general rule, the two bishops
represent more of an advantage when they don't have to work around friendly
knights. Specifically in this case, the h1-a8 diagonal gets cleared of both an
enemy knight and a friendly one, so the exchange initiated with this move and
executed over the following few moves favours White.} Ne7 {This move works
well with a large variety of Black plans, so it is the following one, if any,
that comes in for a bit of criticism.} 10. d3 f5 {This is fine, but the
alternatives merited some attention.} (10... f6 $5 {initiates an interesting
and highly thematic plan.} 11. Bg2 ({After the reasonable} 11. f4 exf4 12. gxf4
f5 $132 {White is seen to be under-developed}) 11... c5 12. O-O g5 {The point.
Black claims that his dark squares, with holes plugged by knights and the
light-square bishop zooming through the tunnels, represent enough of an
advantage to offset the bishop-pair. To check this claim we should examine its
logical extreme:} 13. Nf3 (13. Nf5 Nxf5 14. exf5 Bxf5 15. Bxb7 Rb8 16. Bg2 Qd7
$11 {won't give any edge}) 13... Ng7 14. h4 h6 15. d4 b6 {The fortress is
complete and Black intends either ...Ng6 or ...Qe8-h5 next. In my opinion, he
is not worse.}) 11. exf5 Nxf5 12. Nxf5 Bxf5 13. Bg2 c6 14. h3 $6 Nc7 {
'Forgiving' White a little bit.} (14... Qd7 $5 {is the obvious way to query
White's last move. Black could easily be better if White doesn't have a good
answer up his sleeve, for instance} 15. g4 Bg6 16. Rb1 b6 17. Be3 Nc7 $15) 15.
O-O Ne6 16. Be3 Nc5 17. Rad1 Qd7 18. Kh2 Bg6 {The position is equal, but it
seems like Black has a few more ideas. Here, for instance, he plays with the
idea of ...Rf5-h5 or ...Qf5.} 19. Rd2 Rae8 (19... Qf5 {is called for, making
White clarify the situation rather than giving him time to think about how to
unleash the bishop-pair.} 20. Bxc5 dxc5 $11) 20. Qd1 $5 b6 {I suspect this
move was actually played to cover the a7-pawn in case of tactics after a
d4-push from White, but both it and the next are a little bit loose.} 21. Re1
h6 22. Bxc5 $1 dxc5 (22... bxc5 23. Qa4 Rc8 $11 {is still fine, but it does
look like White is on his way to asserting some kind of control, not least
since his central 3 are stopping Black's central 4 in their tracks.}) 23. Re3
Re6 24. Kg1 Rd6 (24... Qe7 25. Qe1 Re8 26. Be4 Bxe4 27. Rxe4 {may be exactly
what Black was looking to avoid, but in point of fact the e5-pawn is no weaker
than the d3-pawn.}) 25. h4 Rd8 $6 {This looks like a fairly large tactical
oversight by the standards of these guys.} (25... Re8 26. Qe1 Bf7 $11 {is
uninspiring but fine}) 26. Rxe5 Bxd3 (26... Rxd3 $2 27. Bd5+ cxd5 28. Rxd3 Bxd3
29. Rxd5 $16 {is a pawn, albeit not a great one}) 27. Be4 $1 {Well calculated.}
Bxc4 (27... Bxe4 28. Rxd6 Qxd6 29. Re8+ Rxe8 30. Qxd6 $16) (27... Kf8 $5 {
is the machine suggestion, but it too drops a pawn after an ingenious
overloading motif:} 28. Qf3+ Kg8 29. Bxc6 $1 Qxc6 (29... Rxc6 30. Rd5 $16) 30.
Qxc6 $1 (30. Rxd3 Qxf3 31. Rxf3 Rd3 32. Kg2 Rxf3 33. Kxf3 Rd2 $11 {and Black
will regain the pawn}) 30... Rxc6 31. Rd5 Rxd5 32. cxd5 Rd6 33. Rxd3 b5 $14 {
Black has some degree of compensation for the pawn, but the rook endgame is
still going to be unpleasant for him. Nevertheless, this was the best option.})
28. Rxd6 Qxd6 29. Re8+ Rxe8 30. Qxd6 Rxe4 31. Qxc6 Re1+ 32. Kh2 Bxa2 {Perhaps
I have been unfair to Topalov and he may have seen ahead to this endgame,
thinking it playable. However, after White's next, it is seen not to be so.}
33. g4 $1 {A strong move, reckoning that the mate ideas with a White pawn on
g6 will beat Black's passer in a race.} (33. Qa8+ Kh7 34. Qxa7 {is an obvious
possibility, as soon as we notice that White can always escape from 'corner
mates' with g4. However, surprisingly unpleasant now is} Re2 $1 35. Kg2 Bd5+
36. Kf1 Rd2 $1 $132 {when White has to make concessions in view of the threat
of ...Bf3.}) 33... Kh7 34. f4 h5 35. f5 (35. Qd7 $5 {is a computer move,
taking advantage of Black's awful co-ordination and strongly hinting at f5-f6.}
Bb1 (35... hxg4 36. Qd2 $18) 36. Qd2 $1 Re8 37. Qd1 Be4 38. g5 $18) 35... hxg4
36. h5 Bf7 37. Qb7 (37. Qd7 {is again strong, changing the angle of attack:}
Kg8 38. Qd2 Rf1 39. Qg5 $16) 37... Kg8 38. Qxa7 Bxh5 (38... Rf1 $1 $14 {
limited White's advantage and may have drawn.}) 39. Qxb6 c4 (39... Re4 40. Qxc5
Bf7 41. Qc8+ Kh7 {also fails to set up the fortress with Bf7, Rc4 that Black
so badly needs, because of} 42. Qb7 $1 Re2+ 43. Kg3 Kg8 44. c4 {with similar
play to the game}) (39... Re5 40. Qb8+ Re8 41. Qc7 {changes nothing}) 40. Qd8+
Be8 41. Kg3 Kh7 42. Qc7 Kg8 43. Qxc4+ Bf7 44. Qd4 Re8 45. c4 $18 {The position
is now objectively completely winning and Magnus' technique was smooth from
here.} Rf8 46. c5 Be8 47. Qd5+ Kh7 48. Qe6 Bb5 49. c6 Bxc6 50. Qg6+ Kg8 51.
Qxc6 Rf6 52. Qe8+ Kh7 53. Kxg4 Rh6 54. Kf4 Rf6 55. Ke5 Rh6 56. Qe6 $1 {A good
way to break the final roadblock, though not the only one.} 1-0
