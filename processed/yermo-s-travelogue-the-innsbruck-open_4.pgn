a less trodden path.} ({Instead of the routine} 13... Bf8 {played in thousands
of games.}) ({or} 13... exd4 14. cxd4 Nd7 {which is a standard move order to
reach the position they had later in the game.}) 14. Nf1 {Now it will
transpose.} ({I wonder if White could have tried} 14. d5 Na5 15. Bc2 Nb6 16. a4

to go berserk with} Nxe4 $5 30. Rxe4 Nxd5 {which will come short of its goals
after} 31. Ra1 $1 Nc3 32. Re7) 28. Bg5 {[#]} Na3 $6 {Regardless of the
objective value of this move one has to admire Nikita's composure. Facing a
loss which would deprive him of both the tournament win and his final GM norm,
he still goes for the most principled moves.} (28... Nd7 29. Rbc1 Qb6 30. Qxb6

a slow, gradual approach} 35. Ne3 Bc8 36. Rb8 Bd7 37. Rb6 Bc8 38. Nc4 {would
