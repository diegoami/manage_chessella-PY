21. dxe5 h6 22. Nd4 {Diagram [#] White has an edge here but Black could have
kept up the fight with Be6 or even Qg5. But instead Jorden makes a huge
blunder.} Qxe5 $4 {Simply blundering a piece.} 23. Qxe5 Rxe5 24. f4 $18 { The
rook has to move and the bishop on f5 is lost. Quite unbelievable how a 2557
grandmaster can make such an oversight. But when you are heading towards the
last rounds of a strong open tournament, fatigue often sets in.} 1-0
