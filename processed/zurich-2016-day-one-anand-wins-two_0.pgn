1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. Nc3 {The four knights opening is a
surprisingly unpopular version of avoiding the Berlin, mainly due to the fact
that Black has plenty of options that supposedly give him an acceptable game.}
Bd6 { ultra-solid. The point is that the bishop will retreat to f8 eventually
or move to c5 when e5 is properly defended.} 5. O-O O-O 6. d3 Re8 7. a3 {I
can't find any super-high level example of this move, though it does make sense
to clear a2 for the bishop.} h6 8. Bc4 Bc5 9. Be3 Bxe3 10. fxe3 d6 {In this
position Black's rook would rather be on f8. White has a couple of extra tempi,
but I feel Black is solid enough to be ok. } 11. Nh4 Be6 12. Nf5 Bxc4 $6 {Even
though it is natural to break up the structure, Black's position is so
underdeveloped and the pressure on the kingside is mounting at such an alarming
rate that this trade may already be too ambitious.} (12... Nb8 {immediately was
probably a safer choice}) 13. dxc4 Kh7 $2 (13... Re6 {trying to hold on to the
kingside, was been better.}) 14. Qf3 $1 {Anand smells blood!} (14. Nd5 {was
also good enough for a big initiative, but is not as accurate as the
text-move.}) 14... Nb8 {With the idea of solidifying the kingside with Nb8-d7.
But this is too late.} (14... Ng8 { is a sad move to make, but might have
already been necessary. After} 15. c5 { clearly White stands better.} (15. Qg3
$5)) 15. Nxh6 $1 Kxh6 (15... gxh6 16. Qxf6 Qxf6 17. Rxf6 Kg7 18. Raf1 {is
hopeless. White is too active and has an extra pawn.}) 16. Qh3+ Kg6 (16... Nh5
17. Rxf7 (17. g4 {are both winning easily.})) 17. Rf3 {not the only winning
move, actually, but the most exact. White threatens Rg3+ or Qf5+ and Rh3.} Nh5
18. Rf5 Nf6 19. Qh4 {Black gets mated next move.} 1-0
