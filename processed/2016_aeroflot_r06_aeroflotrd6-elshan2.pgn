is Gata's "pet" line against Najdorf. One of the famous occasions, in which

the position. White is a pawn down, and Black has a great 'pack' of pawns in
the center. However, Black king's does not have a real safe place to go to,
and in the long-run Black has a lot of difficulty to mobilize his pieces. In
addition, Black has a number of weaknesses on the queenside, notably the
a-pawn, which would fall once White manages to mobilize his pieces on the
queenside.} 14. Ba5 Qd6 {135} 15. Bc3 {138} Be7 {1005} 16. Ra4 {536} e5 {437}
