1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 c6 4. Bg2 d5 5. b3 {I have never been a particularly
great fan of playing d4 in the middle of a double-fianchetto setup; it is
usually a concession that Black goes to some lengths to force. If given it for
free, as here, Black may be able to arrange some quick ...c5 and equalise
completely without problems.} Bg7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O dxc4 8. bxc4 c5 $1 9. Bb2 {
White feels obliged to play with the isolated c-pawn, which is an interesting
structure in that if Black tries to simply play for its blockade, he will be
at a disadvantage almost automatically. Note that we are still in heavy-duty
theory here.} (9. e3 cxd4 10. exd4 Nc6 $132 {reaches a standard 'hanging
pawns' position- here, I think Black has very easy play against the pawns. For
instance ...Bg4, ...Rc8, ...Qb6.}) 9... cxd4 10. Nxd4 Qb6 {The main move, and
it seems like a solid equaliser.} (10... Nc6 $5 {was chosen last year by
Grischuk. The idea is clearly motivated in no small part by the Yugoslav
Gambit (many orders, including 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 c5 5.0-0 0-0 6.

equality too.} 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Nd2 (12. Bxc6 Rb8 13. Be5 Bh3 14. Bxb8 Bxf1

especially from the point of view of locking down, in the minimum time
possible, a draw with Black against a higher-rated player.} (14... Qa6 {
was played in the precedent, and the isolated c-pawn is so weak that White's
position, while fine or even better according to engines, is practically the
harder to play. The game continued:} 15. Qb2 b6 16. a4 Na5 17. Rfc1 (17. Qb5 $5

fails to change the ultimate verdict, since Black is too poorly co-ordinated
to keep the a6-pawn for long, and in fact he runs considerably greater risk by
leaving his opponent with the pair of bishops.}) 27. Bxd4 Rxd4 28. Bf1 Ra4 29.
