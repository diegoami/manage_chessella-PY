practice.} 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nc3 e6 5. Nxd5 exd5 6. d4 Nc6 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. Bd3 {
I'm not surprised Wesley So decided to avoid the absolute most critical
continuation and try for a positional edge, but I'm not sure what Black's prep
could have been.} (8. Qxd5 $1 {is critical, and I was once privileged to watch
a sharp line being played at a neighbouring board.} d6 (8... Qb6 $6 9. Bc4

had in mind some idea of occupying the d4-square when he made his 8th move,
but it is not possible to execute unless Black helpfully trades the bishops.
With a move such as the one played Black keeps equality.} d4 (13... b6 $6 14.
