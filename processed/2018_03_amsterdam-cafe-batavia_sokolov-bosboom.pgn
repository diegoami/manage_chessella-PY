{The heavyweight 1.d4 player meets the creative King's Indian player.} 1. d4
Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 Nbd7 {This is typical for Bosboom, he
always goes his own way.} 6. Nf3 e5 7. Qc2 {The first new move.} (7. O-O) 7...
exd4 8. Nxd4 O-O 9. Bg5 c6 10. Rd1 Re8 11. O-O a5 12. Rfe1 a4 $1 {An
interesting positional pawn sacrifice. Like Bronstein in the old days, Black
compensates for his weak pawn on d6 with strong imagination.} 13. Bf1 (13. Nxa4
Qa5 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. Nc3 Nc5 {with nice compensation.}) 13... Qa5 14. Bf4 Ne5
15. h3 Nfd7 16. Be3 Nc5 17. f4 Ned7 18. Bf2 Bh6 19. g3 Nf6 20. Nf3 Bf8 21. Kh2
Nh5 22. a3 Nf6 {Black is comfortably hanging in there, just staying calm. Like
in martial arts.} 23. Bg2 Nb3 24. Nd4 {With this move, Sokolov starts to lose
track.} Qh5 $1 {Grabbing the chance, taking over the initiative.} 25. Nxb3 {
Grabbing this pawn leads to disaster.} ({Something modest like} 25. Bg1 {
was called for.}) 25... axb3 26. Qxb3 Ng4+ 27. Kg1 Nxf2 28. Kxf2 d5 {Now White
is feeling the pain on the dark squares.} 29. cxd5 Bc5+ 30. Kf1 (30. Re3 {
was needed.}) 30... Bxh3 31. Rd3 Bg4 32. Na4 Rxa4 {Bosboom doesn't think twice
about exchange sacrifices.} 33. Qxa4 Qh2 34. Ree3 h5 {Running with his rook
pawns is also typically Bosboom. All his favourite themes seem to come
together in this one game. Therefore it was rewarded the best game prize.} 35.
