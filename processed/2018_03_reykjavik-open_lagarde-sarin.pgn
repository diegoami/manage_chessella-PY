1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O Nxe4 {And so one of the world's most
promising prodigies establishes his ambition to join the world elite early on,
by imitating their drawish openings!} 5. d4 Nd6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. dxe5 Nf5 8.
Qxd8+ Kxd8 {We have reached the famous Berlin endgame. For once, I have little
or no knowledge of the theory from either side, but as befits a conoisseur of
chess culture in general, I have absorbed a few of the ideas, which I present
below.} 9. h3 {The highest scoring move. As befits such a free-flowing
position, White has a number of lines in this historically and theoretically
significant opening.} (9. Nc3 {is the main move.} Bd7 (9... h6 {was also
played once in the famous match:} 10. h3 Ke8 11. Ne4 c5 12. c3 b6 13. Re1 Be6
14. g4 {and the draw was agreed here (!) in Kasparov,G-Kramnik,V London 2000})
10. b3 h6 11. Bb2 Kc8 {From here, the king often nestles in between its pawns
on the cozy squares c6 and b7.} 12. Rad1 (12. h3 b6 13. Rad1 Ne7 14. Ne2 Ng6
15. Ne1 h5 16. Nd3 c5 17. c4 a5 18. a4 h4 19. Nc3 Be6 20. Nd5 Kb7 {was a
completely thematic development for Black, who had by now equalised in another
match game: Kasparov,G-Kramnik,V London 2000}) 12... b6 13. Ne2 c5 14. c4 Bc6
15. Nf4 Kb7 16. Nd5 Ne7 $11 {This has become practically a formula by now!
Kasparov,G (2849)-Kramnik,V (2770) London 2000}) (9. b3 {and}) (9. Rd1+ {
are also important moves to know about}) 9... Ke8 10. Nc3 h5 11. Rd1 ({Last
year, the world watched Kramnik try and take down his own opening:} 11. Ne2 b6
12. Rd1 Ba6 (12... c5 $5 $132) 13. Nf4 Bb7 14. a4 Be7 15. e6 Bd6 16. exf7+ (16.
a5 $5 $14) 16... Kxf7 17. Ng5+ Kf6 {when Black had survived the opening and
went on to hold comfortably in Kramnik,V-Malakhov,V Sochi 2017}) 11... Be6 12.
Ne2 (12. Ng5 {must surely be slightly more critical. On a level of principle,
Black is now obligated to play the ugly} Rh6 13. Bf4 Be7 {, or else he stands
worse. Nevertheless, White can take the bishop pair and then play for g4, etc.}
) 12... Bd5 $1 {The time for White to get in aggressive moves like Nf4, Ng5 et
cetera has definitely passed, and Black has equalised.} 13. Nfd4 Nxd4 14. Nxd4
{The only thing Black has to worry about here is the Nf5 motif.} Be7 (14... Rd8
15. Bf4 Bc5 $11 {would have been a more solid choice.}) 15. b3 h4 $6 {
Misplaced maximalism.} (15... Be4 $5 $11 {was probably also more solid, opting
to maintain the bishop pair.}) 16. Nf5 (16. f3 Rh5 17. c4 Be6 18. f4 $14 {
was the machine way of playing against the light-squared bishop.}) 16... Be4
17. Nxe7 Kxe7 18. Rd4 $1 {This pawn exchange is the best way for White to
cause trouble.} Bxc2 19. Bg5+ Ke6 20. Rc1 Bg6 (20... Kxe5 21. Rd7 {looks a lot
worse than it is, though White is still better after} f6 22. Rxc2 fxg5 23. Rxg7
$14) 21. Bxh4 a5 (21... Kxe5 22. Rb4 $1 {recovers the pawn, possibly with
interest. The idea is Bg3+.}) 22. Bg5 a4 23. b4 a3 $6 (23... Kxe5 {was
decidedly called for by now, though White is much better.}) 24. f4 {White has
consolidated his edge and Black has to think very seriously about the idea of
g4.} f6 25. exf6 gxf6 26. Re1+ Kf7 27. Rd7+ Kg8 28. Bxf6 Rh7 29. Rd2 $1 $18 {
In the long run Black will not succeed in holding back the connected pawns on
the kingside.} Bf7 30. Re3 Bd5 31. Rdd3 Ra4 32. Rxa3 Rxb4 33. Ra8+ Kf7 34. Be5
Rb1+ 35. Kh2 Rd1 36. Rc8 Kg6 37. Rf8 Rf7 38. Rg8+ Kf5 39. Rg5+ (39. Bc3 $1 {
led to a mating attack; this is the last major missed chance from either side.
Regrettably Black is lost even with this omission.}) 39... Ke6 40. h4 Bxa2 41.
h5 Bb1 42. g4 Rh7 43. Bc3+ Kf7 44. Rge5 Rd7 45. f5 b5 46. Kg3 {A very nice
game by Lagarde!} 1-0
