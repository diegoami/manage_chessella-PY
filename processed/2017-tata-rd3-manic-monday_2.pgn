Nf3 {0} Nf6 {23} 2. c4 {55} c5 {17} 3. Nc3 {25} d5 {19 Harikrishna likes to play the Semi-Tarrasch. Soon we reach something similar.} 4. cxd5 {45} Nxd5 {9} 5. e3 {202} e6 {123} 6. Bc4 {252} (6. d4 {would be the e3 variation of the Semi Tarrasch.}) 6... Nc6 {144} 7. O-O {48} Be7 {381} 8. Qe2 {509} O-O { 344 What Hari does is nice to learn from. He just develops his pieces and gets his king to safety.} 9. Rd1 {39} Nb6 {257} 10. Bb5 {966} Bd7 {304 Once again simple development. No flashy business.} 11. d4 {402} cxd4 {109} 12. exd4 $1 { 7 Accepting the Isolani is the correct way to play.} (12. Nxd4 Nxd4 13. Rxd4 Bxb5 14. Qxb5 Qc7 {And Black has absolutely no problems.}) 12... Nb4 {29} 13. Bxd7 {6} Qxd7 {9} 14. Ne5 {7} Qe8 $1 {423 A very nice idea. Hari realizes that sooner or later he will play f7-f5 and hence the queen is well placed on e8.} 15. a3 {150} N4d5 {130} 16. Rd3 {22} f5 {742 After this move the e5 square and e6 pawn become weak, but White has no real kingside attack.} 17. Bd2 {1320} Bf6 {144} 18. Re1 {101} Rc8 {357} 19. Rg3 {201} Qe7 {602} 20. Bh6 {1112} Kh8 {297} 21. Bc1 {11} Kg8 {218 Hari has a comfortable position, but with the leader and the black pieces, he is fine with a draw.} 22. Bh6 {53} Kh8 {147} 23. Bc1 {5} Kg8 {66} 24. Rh3 {55 Eljanov shows great fighting spirit, although objectively this decision is incorrect because only Black can have chances to fight for advantage.} Bxe5 {408} 25. Qxe5 {9} Rc6 {19} 26. Qe2 {318} (26. Nxd5 Nxd5 27. Qxd5 $4 exd5 28. Rxe7 Rxc1+ $19) 26... Rfc8 {228 Black's harmony keeps improving.} 27. Bd2 {4} Nxc3 {118} 28. bxc3 {69} (28. Bxc3 Nd5 $17 {is clearly better for Black.}) 28... Nd5 {25} 29. a4 {609} Qf7 {339} 30. Rg3 {152} Nxc3 { 288} 31. Rxc3 {4} Rxc3 {8} 32. Bxc3 {7} Rxc3 {8} 33. h3 {3} Rc6 {91 Black has pinched a pawn and White has to play carefully, in order to not let Black consolidate.} 34. Qe5 $1 {23} Qd7 {202} (34... h6 {looked more human.} 35. Qb8+ Kh7 36. Qxa7 Ra6 37. Qc5 Rxa4 38. Qe5 Ra6 39. Rc1 {White has compensation and the game should most probably end in a draw.}) 35. Qb8+ {85} Kf7 {56} 36. Qxa7 {27} Ra6 {15} 37.
