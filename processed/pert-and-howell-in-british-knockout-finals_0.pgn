        g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O d6 6. Nc3 $5 {It seemed obvious that White 
        wanted to play the Fianchetto Variation of the King's Indian, but now 
        the game is being steered into the Pirc territory.} Nbd7 7. a4 $5 {What 
        is the idea of this move? Apart from gaining space on the queenside it 
        throws the ball back in Black's court.} (7. e4 {would have been Pirc.}) 
        7... e5 8. dxe5 dxe5 9. a5 $1 {Allowing a move like a6 is almost out of 
        question.} a6 10. Qd3 $1 {The queen gets ready to settle down on the c4 
        square which would be perfect for it.} Re8 11. Qc4 h6 12. Rd1 {White has 
        not much of the control in the centre, but his pieces are so nicely placed. 
        He is clearly better.} Rb8 $2 13. Nh4 $1 {Suddenly defending the g6 pawn 
        is not at all easy.} b5 (13... g5 {This move doesn't lose the pawn but 
        is a positional catastrophe.} 14. Nf5 Bf8 15. h4 $18 {Black's position 
        would crumble in a few moves.}) 14. axb6 cxb6 15. Nxg6 $18 {White is a 
        pawn up and Black has absolutely no counterplay. It is surprising that 
        Nick couldn't finish off the game quickly.} b5 16. Qb3 Qc7 17. Nh4 Bf8

        Rc3 47. Bd5 Rd3 48. Bc4 Rc3 49. Be6 Bd4 50. Rxa6 {White has two extra 
        pawns. The only technical difficulty are the opposite coloured bishops. 
        But even so White should be winning here.} Rc2 51. Ra2 Rc6 52. Bd5 Rd6

        given White excellent winning chances.}) 77... Rd5 $1 { Now Kf4 is a big 
        threat and the b5 pawn is also hanging.} 78. Bf7 (78. b6 Kf4+ 79. Kh6 
        Kg3+ 80. Kg7 Kxh4 $11) 78... Rxb5 79. Kg6 Rb6 80. Rxb6 Bxb6 {Quite a heartbreak 
        for Pert.} 1/2-1/2
