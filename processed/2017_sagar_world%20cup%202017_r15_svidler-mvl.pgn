to be very interesting. One knight moves around the board for six out of the
first eight moves, and yet Black is doing absolutely fine.} 9. h4 {[%emt 0:00:
08] Peter believes in his preparation, just like MVL did in game one he sticks
to his opening.} Nd4 {[%emt 0:00:02]} 10. d3 {[%emt 0:00:04]} e6 {[%emt 0:00:

[%emt 0:00:03] Already Black is to be preferred. If you were to keep the king
back on e1 and the pawn on h2, White's position would be preferable. But two
problems are just too much to rectify. It's not that White is worse. I just
feel that Black's moves are natural, while White's plans are not so easy to
find, at least in a rapid game.} 14. a3 {[%emt 0:00:39]} Bd6 {[%emt 0:01:08]}

{[%emt 0:00:54] As Peter said after the game, when he was chatting with MVL -
he didn't believe in this idea, but saw that it was interesting and went for
it.} O-O-O $1 {[%emt 0:00:19] The king will be well placed on b8.} 21. h5 {
[%emt 0:02:06]} Kc7 $3 {[%emt 0:03:08] "Kc7 was such a nasty move", were
Svidler's words after the game ended. In one stroke MVL is able to kill two
birds. First of all he is able to get his king off the eighth rank, so that
hxg6 hxg6 Qxh8 Rxh8 Rxh8 doesn't come with a check. And secondly the queen on
d6 is defended and gxf5 becomes possible. This move is easy to dismiss, as one
sees Rc1 and thinks that the king is misplaced on c7, but it is not as MVL
shows in the game.} 22. Bxf7 {[%emt 0:04:03]} (22. hxg6 hxg6 23. Qxh8 Rxh8 24.
