Nf3 {(0s) The Chinese have been like a machine in this event. In round four they dismantled the young and talented Italian team 3-1.} d5 {(0s)} 2. d4 {(0s)} Nf6 {(0s)} 3. c4 {(0s)} c6 {(0s)} 4. e3 {(47s)} Bg4 {(26s)} 5. h3 {(50s)} Bh5 {(7s) } (5... Bxf3 6. Qxf3 e6 {used to be considered the safest continuation but recent results in 2015 and 2016 favor White. That may have been the reason behind the Italian GM's opening choice or he may have considered other matters that are unknown to your commentator!}) 6. g4 {(33s)} Bg6 {(7s)} 7. Ne5 {(3s)} e6 {(95s)} 8. Nxg6 {(9s)} hxg6 {(6s)} 9. Bg2 {(7s) Wang Yue is a very classical player. I have always considered his positional understanding as one of the best of players of my generation. The way he handles Dvirnyy's opening choice is no exception to his style: "I get two bishops and I start grinding!"} Nbd7 { (102s)} 10. Qd3 {(84s)} g5 {(440s)} 11. Nc3 {(156s)} Bb4 {(149s)} 12. Bd2 { (82s)} Qe7 {( 1705s)} 13. a3 {(257s)} Bxc3 {(1081s)} 14. Bxc3 {(227s)} Nf8 { (141s)} 15. cxd5 {(1769s)} exd5 {( 99s) The position is closed and White needs to do something before his pair of bishops become useless.} 16. Qf5 { (362s)} Ne4 $6 {(839s) This move is not a blunder or even a positional mistake but this changes the game's character from a tough complicated battle into a technical calm position which is more in line with Wang Yue's strengths. In that sense, the Italian GM puts himself into an unfavorable situation by entering into his opponent's area of expertise.} 17. Bxe4 {(670s)} Qxe4 {(38s)} 18. Qxe4+ {(5s)} dxe4 {(4s)} 19. d5 {(21s)} cxd5 {(146s)} 20. Rd1 {(41s)} O-O-O $2 {(314s) But this almost throws away the game.} (20... Ne6 21. Rxd5 f6 {looks very drawish to me.}) 21. Bxg7 {(38s)} Rg8 {(6s)} 22. Bf6 {(366s)} Rd7 {(5s)} 23. f4 $1 { (313s) This is exactly what I was talking about Wang Yue's great understanding of technical positions.} exf3 {(99s)} (23... gxf4 24. exf4 Ne6 25. Kf2 b6 (25... Nxf4 26. Rc1+ {loses the knight!}) 26. Ke3 {with close to a decisive advantage}) 24. Rf1 {(105s)} ({I prefer} 24. O-O Nh7 25. Bd4 b6 26. Rxf3) 24... Ne6 {(223s)} 25. Rxf3 {(22s)} Kc7 {(280s)} 26.

R1f3 {(42s)} Kc6 $2 {(5s) played so fast and what is worse: loses a pawn on the spot! I cannot say more other than blundering a pawn was a contagious epidemic in the fourth round of Baku Olympiad!} (30... Rg6 31. Be5 Nd8 {is very bad but not over!}) 31. Bxg5 {(88s)} Nxg5 {(135s)} 32. Rxg5 {(4s)} d4 {(41 s)} 33. e4 {(109s)} d3+ {(6s)} 34. Kd2 {(3s)} Re6 {(46s)} 35. e5 {(75s)} Rd5 {(44s) } 36. Rxf7 {(67s) An easy victory for Wang Yue. Dvirnyy had a draw in his pocket but he made way too many mistakes!} 1-0
