1. c4 e6 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 d5 4. Nf3 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. d4 dxc4 7. Ne5 {Gawain
Jones departs from his usual 1.e4 fare and plays a topical Catalan.} Nc6 8.
Nxc6 bxc6 9. Na3 Bxa3 10. bxa3 Ba6 {Right now this is fashionable.} (10... Nd5
11. Qa4 Nb6 12. Qa5 (12. Qxc6 Rb8 {is another significant line, and I think
Black is more or less fine here.}) 12... Bb7 13. Rd1 Qc8 14. Rb1 Rd8 15. e4 Ba6
$1 $132 {Black maintained equality here in Howell,D-Speelman,J England 2017.
It is a fair bet that White knew about this game and maybe even that Black
anticipated he would...}) 11. a4 Qc8 $6 $146 {This novelty commits to an
exchange sacrifice, which may not end up working out well.} (11... Qd6 {
was a sensible move in a predecessor game, which Black may have known about.}
12. Qd2 (12. e4 Qb4 13. Qc2 Rab8 $132) 12... Rfb8 13. Qa5 Rb6 14. Re1 Bb7 (
14... Qxd4 $5 {is also playable}) 15. Qc3 Qb4 16. Qxb4 Rxb4 17. Bd2 Rb2 18. Bc3
Rc2 19. Rec1 Rxc1+ 20. Rxc1 Nd5 $11 {Wang,Y-Zhou,J Xinghua Jiangsu 2011}) 12.
Ba3 Rd8 13. Be7 Rd5 $5 (13... Rd6 $5 $14 {could be the best way to give the
exchange, which in fact White is not encouraged to take.}) 14. Bxf6 gxf6 15.
Bxd5 cxd5 16. e4 $1 dxe4 17. Qg4+ {Now White has a material advantage, and
whatever parallel one wants to draw with the ...b5 QGA exchange sacrifice line
or whatever, he stands better.} Kf8 18. Qxe4 Bb7 (18... Qb7 $5 19. Qxh7 Qd5 $14
{offers slightly more interesting compensation}) 19. Qxh7 Qd7 20. Qh6+ (20. Qh4
$1 Ke7 21. Rab1 Qd5 22. f3 $16 {was concretely the way to do it. White need
not shrink from Qe4 in what follows.}) 20... Ke7 21. Qe3 Qxa4 22. Rab1 Bd5 $14
{Black seems to have broadly speaking gotten things back on track. The
practical problems caused by the long diagonal are augmented by the fact that
Black has a pawn for the exchange now.} 23. Rb2 Rh8 24. Qc3 a5 25. f3 Kd7 26.
Rc1 Ra8 $6 {A slightly strange move, unless it occurs to you that Black might
have been concerned about the odd-looking idea of Rb3-a3.} (26... f5 {was more
natural. Now} 27. Rb3 $6 {is nothing in particular after} Qxa2 $1 {due to the
threat to h2.} 28. Rb2 Qa4 $15) 27. Qe3 Rg8 28. Kg2 f5 29. Kf2 Rh8 30. Ke1 Qc6
31. Rc3 Qa8 32. Qe2 Qa7 33. Qd1 e5 (33... f4 $5 $44 {kept the tension going
longer, and thus might have stood better chances against a White player who,
it seems, might have been making some slightly sub-optimal calls.}) 34. Qa4+
Kc8 35. Rxc4 {White does not miss his chance to clarify the position at the
cost of reinstating material parity.} Bxc4 36. Qxc4 Rd8 37. Kf1 (37. Qb5 $5
Rxd4 38. Qxe5 $14) 37... Qxd4 38. Qa6+ (38. Qxd4 $5 Rxd4 39. h4 $44) 38... Kd7
39. Qb5+ Ke7 {Black now plays for a win!} 40. Kg2 Rd5 41. Qe2 Kf6 42. Rc2 Qb4 (
42... c5 $17 {was completely natural and probably winning, and would have been
a good culmination to the strategy begun with ...Rd5.}) 43. Qe3 c5 44. Qh6+ Ke7
45. Re2 {Now White is in some sense 'in', and there is compensation again.} Qb5
46. Rf2 Qb8 47. Qg5+ Ke6 48. g4 $1 f4 49. Qf5+ Ke7 50. Re2 Kf8 51. Qf6 Qd6 {
Black has to give this back to alleviate some of the pressure. But after this,
there are close to no winning chances- for either side.} 52. Qxd6+ Rxd6 53.
