Bg5 {The Trompowsky! A rare guest in GM games.} e6 3. e4 h6 4. Bxf6 Qxf6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. Qd2 d6 7. a3 Ba5 8. Nge2 Nc6 {This is probably why the Trompowsky is a rare gues in GM games. I like Black already, he has the pair of bishops and White's central position doesn't impress me to the point where it would be compensation.} 9. Rd1 O-O 10. f4 e5 $1 {A very standard break on the center. White's position is underdeveloped and his dark squares are going to suffer without his bishop of that square.} 11. dxe5 dxe5 12. b4 Bb6 13. f5 Ne7 $2 {This was definitely not the way to punish White's play.} (13... Rd8 $1 14. Nd5 Qh4+ 15. Ng3 Nd4 $1 {with a big, big initiative all over the board.}) 14. Na4 Qh4+ 15. Ng3 g6 16. fxg6 Nxg6 (16... fxg6 $15 {made much more sense, opening the f-file and making it difficult for White to castle.}) 17. Be2 Nf4 18. Bf3 Be6 (18... Qg5 $1 19. Nxb6 axb6 20. Qc3 h5 $1 {with an initiative.}) 19. Nxb6 cxb6 20. O-O Qg5 21. Kh1 Rfd8 22. Qf2 Rxd1 23. Rxd1 Ng6 24. Nf1 Rd8 { Black exchanges rooks, good enough for equality but he is no longer thinking of an advantage.} 25. Rxd8+ Qxd8 26. Qd2 Qxd2 27. Nxd2 Ne7 28. Kg1 Nc8 29. Kf2 Nd6 30. Be2 f6 31. Bd3 Kf7 32.
