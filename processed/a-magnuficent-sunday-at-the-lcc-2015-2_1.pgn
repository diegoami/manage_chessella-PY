Knowing the solid player that he is, it shoudn't be a very tough task.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Bg7 6. Bg2 Nb6 (6... Nxc3 7. bxc3 c5 {is much more common, but White can be solid here with} 8. e3) 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. e3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. b3 e5 11. Nxe5 Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxe5 13. Bb2 Qe7 14. Qc2 c6 15.

Nxe2 Bf8 (25... Rd2 26. fxg7 Rxb2 27. Nc3 Kxg7 $11) 26. Bd4 Kf7 27. Rc3 Nd5 28. Rc4 Nxf6 {Black has recovered the pawn and the position is about equal. But Maxime needs to win and hence tries to keep as many pieces on the board as possible.} 29. Kg2 Nd5 30. Kf3 a5 31. Bc5 Bg7 32. Bd4 Bf8 33. Bc5 Bh6 {At this point it seemed as if Giri was quite confident that he would easily make a draw. But now he starts making mistakes and soon lands up in a positional that pretty irritating to defend.} 34. Rd4 Bg7 35. Rd2 a4 $1 36. Bd4 (36. b4 { might have made it easier to achieve the draw.}) 36... Bxd4 37. Rxd4 axb3 38. axb3 Ra8 $1 {The rook takes the open file and is threatening to penetrate to a2. It is not much but it is surely quite unpleasant.} 39. Rd3 Ra2 40. h3 Rb2 41. Nd4 h5 42. f5 $1 {A good move by Anish. It either exchanges a few more pawns or secures the e6 square for the knight.} g5 43. Ne6 Kf6 44. Nd8 (44. g4 {would have been good, but it is very difficult for a human to make this move, especially when your opponent can play h4.} h4 45. Nc5 Rh2 (45... Nf4 46. Ne4+ Ke5 47. Nc5 $1 Kf6 48. Ne4+ $11) 46. Ne4+ Kg7 47. Nxg5 Kh6 48. Nf7+ Kg7 49. Ng5 $11) 44... Rh2 $1 {A super accurate move by MVL.} 45. Nxb7 Rxh3 (45... h4 $6 46. Kg4 hxg3 47. Kxg3 $11) 46. Nd6 Rh2 47. Ke4 Re2+ 48. Kd4 Ne7 49. Kc5 $6 (49. g4 $1 {was such a nice move but so difficult to find in time pressure.} hxg4 50. Ne4+ Kf7 51. Nxg5+ $11) 49... g4 50. Kb6 Re5 51. Kc7 c5 $6 (51... Nd5+ $1 $19) 52.

Rh8 $2 (59. Rh7 {would have preserved excellent drawing chances.}) 59... Rxe5 $1 {As alert as ever, MVL grabbed his chance and equalised his match forcing the games into a tiebreak.} 0-1
