1. c4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e3 Nf6 4. b3 Be7 5. Bb2 {It seems that after its use by
the World Champion in a tiebreak game against Giri, this system is gaining
traction among a number of top players. I shall try and avoid rehashing my
comments to that game, but it deserves mention.} O-O 6. Nc3 c5 ({Black can
delay ...c5, but after a few moves it transpires that the move is more
indispensable to him than d4 is to White, and by extension, he must steel
himself sooner or later to recapture on d5 with the knight.} 6... b6 7. Be2 Bb7
8. O-O Nbd7 9. Rc1 {and ...c5 must be one of Black's next three moves, or else
he is just being silly. Meanwhile, White can try Qc2-b1-a1, Rfd1, etc.}) 7.
cxd5 Nxd5 8. Qc2 (8. Nxd5 {was Carlsen's choice. A number of ways for Black to
in principle equalise the game have been suggested, and he should probably
memorise one or more of them, because without pre-existing knowledge, the
hanging pawn or isolated pawn structure that must result is difficult for
Black to play.} exd5 9. d4 Qa5+ 10. Qd2 Qxd2+ 11. Kxd2 Nc6 (11... cxd4 $146 {
"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly." This
is a remarkable line from Shakespeare's Macbeth that not only provides the
most confusing multiple subjunctive in the history of the language, but also
neatly encapsulates Black's strategic decision here.} 12. Nxd4 Nc6 13. Nxc6 (
13. Be2 Bd7 14. a3 Rac8 $11 {should lead to nothing}) 13... bxc6 14. Rc1 Bb4+
15. Kd1 Bd7 $132 {Black has a reasonable amount of activity to compensate for
his worse structure.}) 12. dxc5 Bxc5 13. Bb5 Bb4+ 14. Ke2 $14 {Carlsen,M-Giri,
A Wijk aan Zee 2018}) 8... Nb4 (8... b6 $11 {is also possible immediately;
this seems like a slightly less adventurous way of equalising.}) (8... Nc6 {
was most played in the preceding games that reached this point: notable was the
} 9. h4 $5 h6 10. g4 $40 {of Carlsen,M-Ganguly,S Doha 2016; the World Champion
was later outplayed but managed to extricate himself and draw.}) 9. Qb1 b6 10.
a3 (10. h4 $5 {might be playable here too, but here there is} Ba6 $1 $132 {
and this might be the point of Black's 8th.}) 10... Nd5 11. Nxd5 (11. h4 $5 {
can again be tried, but the follow-up} Nf6 12. Rg1 Bb7 13. Be2 Nc6 14. g4 Na5 {
indicates another possible point of Black's 8th.} (14... Nd4 $5 $14)) 11...
exd5 12. d4 Nc6 13. Bb5 Bd7 14. O-O {White has no opening edge and this move
admits that.} Nxd4 15. Nxd4 cxd4 16. Bxd7 Qxd7 17. Bxd4 {Reaching a simplified
position in which Black has one weakness, but is compensating for it well
enough with activity. I don't suppose either player was seriously anticipating
anything but a draw here. As we know, this kind of thinking can lead to
complacency...} Rfc8 18. Rd1 Rc6 19. Qb2 $6 {Now White has to be slightly more
careful than Black.} (19. Qd3 $11) 19... Qf5 {Threatening ...Rc2.} 20. Qe2 (20.
Bxg7 Rc2 $19) 20... Rc2 21. Qf3 (21. Rd2 Rac8 22. b4 $11 {is the way the
computer suggests to grovel, and Black seems to have nothing concrete.}) 21...
Qxf3 22. gxf3 Bh4 23. e4 (23. Rf1 Rac8 24. a4 Re2 $36 {is equally unpleasant})
23... dxe4 24. fxe4 Bg5 25. a4 Bd2 $15 {Black has managed to liquidate his
only weakness, and what is left is his slight advantage in piece activity.} 26.

Black needs a plan here too.} (30. e5 f5 31. e6 Kf8 32. e7+ Kxe7 33. Bxg7 Ke6

reach the time control'.} 33. Ke2 Bf4+ 34. Kf3 Bd2 35. Ke2 Bf4+ 36. Kf3 g5 37.

axb6 43. Kg2 Rb2 $15 {fails to solve White's problems}) 40... Rb2 (40... Bd6 $5
{deserved consideration, trying seriously to take the bishops off, the better
to emphasise the slightly greater activity of Black's other two pieces
compared to their White counterparts.} 41. Kg2 Bc5 42. Bxc5 Rxc5 $15 {and
White still has a little suffering ahead}) 41. a5 $1 {Liquidating down to
something which is impossible to try and win.} bxa5 42. Bxa7 f5 43. exf5+ Kxf5
