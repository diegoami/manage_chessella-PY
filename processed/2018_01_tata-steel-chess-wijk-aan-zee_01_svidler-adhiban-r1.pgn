1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Nf3 e6 5. Be2 Ne7 6. O-O h6 {Not the move I was
intending to recommend in my forthcoming book (!) but nevertheless a main line.
Perhaps it is worth a detailed look!} 7. Nbd2 Bh7 8. Nb3 Nd7 9. a4 (9. Bd2 {
may possibly be a better challenge to Black's ...g5-centric setup (though
obviously Svidler in his preparation thought differently.) Careless play by
Black would be:} Nf5 10. Rc1 g5 11. h3 Be7 12. c4 $14 {and White obtains
essentially what he wants.}) 9... g5 $5 {A very logical novelty (at least
according to my database.)} (9... Nf5 10. a5 Be7 {was played previously, but
as in the last note ...Be7 is met well by c4.} 11. c4 $14 {Azarov,S-Kunal,M
Abu Dhabi 2016}) 10. a5 a6 (10... Nf5 11. c4 $1 g4 12. Nfd2 h5 13. a6 b6 14.
cxd5 cxd5 15. Nb1 $14 {seems concerning, or at least easier to play for White,
as Black's king lacks shelter on either the kingside or queenside, and its
home in the centre will soon come under attack. Maybe best now is ...f6, but
White should be better.}) 11. c3 (11. Bd2 Nf5 12. h3 {looks sensible, keeping
open the option of g4 and also thinking vaguely about the strategically
desirable Ne1-d3 or Qe1/Bb4 plans.}) 11... Nf5 {Now this may be equal as ...
Black will be able to choose between ...c5 and ...f6.} 12. Bd3 (12. c4 $11 {
may proceed like the note to Black's 10th but Black now has b5 covered in the
event of the c-pawns being swapped.}) (12. g4 Ne7 13. Be3 {is advocated by the
engine but after} f6 $1 $13 {I am skeptical.}) 12... g4 13. Ne1 h5 14. Nc2 c5 {
As promised, but White now tries to prove a little something and basically
gets it.} (14... f6 $5 15. f4 Qe7 $132 {may have avoided giving White such
easy play.}) 15. Nxc5 Nxc5 $6 (15... Bxc5 $1 16. dxc5 Nxc5 17. Nb4 Rc8 $11 {
may have been easier.}) 16. dxc5 Bxc5 17. Nd4 $1 (17. Bf4 Nh4 $1 $11 {is a
good wrinkle for Black, exchanging the bishops and bringing his knight to a
great square on g6.}) 17... Bxd4 (17... Nh4 {may once again have been a good
idea. White always lacks f4 due to Black's advanced kingside pawns.} 18. Be3
Rc8 19. Bxh7 Rxh7 20. Qd2 Rg7 $132) 18. cxd4 Rc8 {Reaching a curious position
where White must be better but his position may be a little harder to play.}
19. Ra3 $6 {A strategically well-informed move, thinking about doubling on the
f-file in future, but this proves impossible to arrange.} (19. Bf4 {With the
simple plan of Rc1, since Black's c8-rook currently does more work than the
White a1-rook.} Nh4 {If Black plays ...Ne7 then all the minor pieces come off,
which is in White's interest only.} 20. Bxh7 Rxh7 21. Rc1 $14) 19... Rc7 20.
Bf4 Nh4 21. Qd2 (21. Bxh7 Rxh7 22. Qd2 {is the engine opinion, still trying to
arrange a rook trade with Rc1.}) 21... Bxd3 22. Bg5 Qc8 23. Rxd3 Nf5 {Almost a
perfect fortress. Black has equalised for the second time! Any lingering
advantage the engine gives is purely down to preference for a bishop over a
knight.} 24. Qb4 Kd7 25. Qa4+ Rc6 26. Rc1 Rg8 27. Bf6 Qc7 28. g3 Rc8 29. Rc5
