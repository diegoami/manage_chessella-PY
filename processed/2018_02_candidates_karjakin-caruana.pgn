1. e4 {No Nf3 for today! It would be silly to say that 1.e4 is more solid than
1.Nf3, which had been Karjakin's choice in the first half of the event. But
sometimes you want to fall back on the lines which you are most comfortable
with, and for Karjakin that is 1.e4.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {This is not the first time that Caruana has played the Classical
Sicilian, however the last time he played it was six years ago in 2009.} 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qd2 a6 8. 0-0-0 Bd7 9. f4 h6 10. Bh4 {Main moves here for Black are g5
and Nxe4. But Caruana goes for the relative sideline with 10...b5.} b5 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. f5 {A top level game that reached this position was Ivanchuk-Piket
which continued h5. But Caruana is still in his preparation and goes for Qb6.} Qb6 13. fxe6 fxe6 14. Nxc6 {Karjakin tries to play as solidly as possible.} Qxc6 (14... Bxc6 {was also possible.} )15. Bd3 h5 16. Kb1 b4 17. Ne2 Qc5 18. Rhf1 Bh6 19. Qe1 a5 $5 {A very interesting pawn sacrifice on f6. Of course White should
be careful in taking it, because after Qe5 and Bg7 his position might just
collapse.} (19... Ke7 20. Qg3 Rag8 (20... h4 21. Qxh4 Bg5 22. Qg3 e5 23. Nf4 exf4 )21. Qf3 Rf8 22. Bxa6 )20. b3 $5 {A very double-edged move. On one hand
it weakens the dark squares and on the other it prepares Bc4. Who benefits the
most from it? The one who plays the best chess from here onwards.} (20. Rxf6 Bg7 21. Rf3 Qe5 22. c3 a4 $13 )Rg8 (20... a4 $6 {No matter how natural this
move looks it is a mistake because it weakens the b4 pawn. As the famous
trainer Mark Dvoretsky explains, Black wants his queen on e5, not on c5
defending the b4 pawn. That is the task of the a5 pawn!} 21. Bc4 $1 axb3 22. Bxb3 $16 )21. g3 Ke7 (21... Qe5 {was a natural move and is met with} 22. Bc4 $1 Qxe4 23. Nd4 $1 Qxe1 24. Rfxe1 $18 {White is just better.} )22. Bc4 Be3 23. Rf3 (23. Nf4 $5 {was a natural move and maybe better.} Bd4 24. Qd2 Bc3 25. Qd3 $16 )Rg4 {Caruana's position looks quite attractive on the surface. His
pieces are actively placed and he has good chances. However, his king is on e7
and that should always be kept in mind.} 24. Qf1 Rf8 25. Nf4 Bxf4 26. Rxf4 a4 (26... Bc6 {keeping the status quo was also possible.} )27. bxa4 $5 {A bold
decision by Sergey who is ready to ruin his structure but at the same time
realises that the bishop will sit well on b3.} Bxa4 28. Qd3 Bc6 29. Bb3 Rg5 30. e5 $5 {The most critical moment of the game. Karjakin finds the right moment
to break through in the center. Although the position is roughly equal
the responsibility on Black's shoulders to make accurate moves has increased
sharply as his king is in the centre.} Rxe5 $1 (30... Qxe5 31. Rxb4 $14 )31. Rc4 $5 Rd5 32. Qe2 $5 {White has sacrificed a pawn but hopes to get to the
black king in some way or the other.} (32. Qxd5 Qxd5 33. Rxd5 Bxd5 34. Rxb4 {
would result in a drawish endgame.} )Qb6 33. Rh4 Re5 $6 (33... Rxd1+ 34. Qxd1 Rh8 {Exchanging one rook would have reduced White's attacking chances.
Here Black has lesser dangers.} 35. Rxh5 Rxh5 36. Qxh5 Qg1+ 37. Kb2 Qd4+ 38. Kb1 Be8 $15 )34. Qd3 Bg2 {Caruana want to play d5 but would like to keep his
bishop actively placed on e4. In some ways this is a highly ambitious move.} 35. Rd4 d5 36. Qd2 Re4 $2 {Caruana was in terrible time pressure and missed
White's next move. As Karjakin described it, this sacrifice was not
particularly difficult to calculate.} (36... Be4 37. Rxb4 Qc7 {and position is
complicated but Black is not worse.} )37. Rxd5 exd5 38. Qxd5 Qc7 (38... Rd4 39. Qxd4 Qxd4 40. Rxd4 $16 {was the best defence, but this pawn down endgame looks
lost.} )39. Qf5 $1 {Qh7 is an extremely difficult threat to meet.} (39. Qxh5 {
was also very strong.} Re6 40. Bxe6 Kxe6 41. Qe2+ Kf7 42. Qxg2 $18 {White
shouldn't have too many difficulties converting this.} )Rf7 40. Bxf7 Qe5 (40... Kxf7 41. Rd7+ $18 )41. Rd7+ Kf8 42. Rd8+ {What a stunning finale. The
moment Caruana extended his hand, the playing hall erupted in a thunderous
applause for the new Challenger - Sergey Karjakin!} (42. Rd8+ Kxf7 43. Qh7+ Ke6 44. Qd7# )1-0
