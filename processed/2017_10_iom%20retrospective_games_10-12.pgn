{How would you continue with White?} 23. Bxg7 {Incorrect. But the solution is
far from easy.} (23. Be7 $1 {Yes yes, once seen it seems not too difficult.
But to me, when my husband showed me in awe what his laptop was shouting...it
did look like a brain-breaker. Who is able to see such backwards silent moves
in the middle of the attack? Not many.} Kf7 (23... Qxd2 $140 24. Bxf6 Bxf6 25.

for a win and missed a nice trick which will be revealed in the following.} ({

Qxg4 Bxg4 {Pretty much forced up to now but the idea Kramnik had starting with
14.g4 was to go for a positional exchange sacrifice} 17. Nxe4 Be2 {Offer
accepted.} ({Nothing wrong though with} 17... Rd8 18. Kg2 Bf5 $13) 18. Nxd6
Bxf1 $2 {Understandable but too materialistic.} ({There is no rush in taking
the exchange, so Black can first develop the pieces to better squares and ask
White an important question: how exactly will your development look? And react
accordingly.} 18... Nd7 19. f3 {Already a concession.} (19. Nxb7 Rf6 20. Na5

pieces enjoy good collaboration too. There were no further problems for White

{What would you play with Black?} 18... Qa6 {was incorrectly chosen by Hou
Yifan.} ({As an interesting coincidence, I was passing by in this precise
moment and stopped for a while to understand what was going on. Shortly after,
my husband joined. After the game, we looked at each other and said: "wasn't}
