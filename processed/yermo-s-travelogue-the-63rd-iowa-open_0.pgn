{My first game against GM Gareyev. We had both taken part in the Twin Ports
Open, the week prior, but I did not play well enough there to earn the right to
a game against him :-). I had decided before this tournament to avoid specific
preparation for individual games, and in furtherance of that goal, only knew
who I was playing 3 minutes before round time!} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4.
Nc3 dxc4 5. e3 {Alekhine's variation.} b5 6. a4 b4 7. Ne2 $5 { I had never seen
this move before the game. Afterwards, I found that Timur had played it during
a rapid game in Hawaii a few years ago, Gareyev-Kojima, Hawaii 2015, a rather
entertaining game, actually. Staring at the position, I tried to figure out the
pros and cons of this move, compared to the more usual 7. Na2 and 7. Nb1
approaches.} a5 $6 {I think this misses the mark. Black should be focusing
energy on developing pieces, usually with an eye towards ... c5, while White
works to recoup his pawn. The text move secures b4, allowing a more
"harmonious" ...Ba6, and prevents White from playing a4-a5 himself. However, it
is not clear at this point that Black wants his bishop on a6, and a4-a5 does
not need to be feared yet. A better approach would seem to be immediately going
for ...e6, ...Nbd7, and ...Be7 or ...c5, depending on circumstances. As my
friend Denton Dykes would say, "Do what you have to do, before you do what you
want to do!"} 8. Nf4 Ba6 {Consistent, but not great.} 9. Ne5 e6 10. Qf3
{Threatening fire and brimstone! Besides the obvious threat to c6, f7 is
suddenly looking more tender. Fearing ghosts, I played:} Ra7 $6 { Consistent
with my apparent goal of misplacing my pieces :-)} (10... Qc7 $142 { Dealing
with both threats in a way that does not misplace pieces, and also fights for
the e5 and c5 squares.}) (10... c3 $5) 11. Bxc4 Bxc4 12. Nxc4 Be7 13. O-O O-O
{[#] Ok, here, I thought I was doing Ok, just a normal opening disadvantage as
Black against a strong GM. Then came:} 14. e4 $5 {Timur is planning to crush me
like a bug! I needed to find something to change the trend of the game. So, I
held my breath, and plunged into:} Qxd4 $1 15. Be3 Qxc4 16. Bxa7 Qxe4 (16...
Nbd7 $1 {Looks even better. in hindsight. Getting the knight into action should
take priority over half-opening the e-file for White's rooks ;-)}) 17. Qxe4
Nxe4 18. Rac1 {A critical moment for me. I need to get my remaining pieces into
the game, but spy a "great" idea. Somehow, I refused to see that Nf4-d3 was
even a possibility in the lines I looked at. So, instead of following a plan
such as ...c5, ...Nd7, with ...Nd2-b3 thrown in, I took the opportunity to help
White reposition his minors to great squares:} Bg5 $2 19. Be3 {Ugh!} Bf6 (19...
e5 {My initial intention. When we got here, I saw: } 20. Nd3 Bxe3 21. fxe3 f6
22. Nc5 $1 $18) 20. Nd3 $16 {So, White's position is stabilized, and I am still
playing with only half my pieces. Timur proceeds to do what GMs are supposed to
do to NMs ;-)} Rd8 21. Rfd1 Rd5 22. Ba7 Nd7 23. Rxc6 g5 24. Rcc1 Bd4 $4 25.

my g-pawn is undefended.} 34. Re1 (34. Re1 N5c4 35. Rxg5+ Kf6 36. Rc5 $18) 1-0
