{It was a tremendous privilege and honor to have the opportunity to face the
reigning World Champion, Magnus Carlsen, even if it was only a simul
exhibition. Before the game, almost all the chess friends that I spoke to said
that there is no point preparing against the guy - he simply plays everything
under the sun as a quick search on Megadatabase will tell you. Still, I
checked a few trendy lines that I thought Magnus might try and by sheer luck,
one of them actually appeared over the board...} 1. c4 Nf6 {This was an
attempt to transpose to Anti-Grunfeld lines which may arise after 2.Nf3 g6.} (
1... e6 2. Nc3 {,}) (1... g6 2. e4 {and}) (1... c5 {were other possible
options.}) 2. Nc3 e5 3. e3 {True to his style, Magnus cannot be bothered to go
into the absolute mainstream stuff. This was not a difficult move to predict
given that he has played 1.e3 at the Baku Olympiad against a reasonably strong
Grandmaster!} ({A recent game I played with another strong Norwegian player
continued (by transposition)} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Bc5 {
A trendy line popularised by Fabiano Caruana} 7. O-O O-O 8. d3 Bb6 9. Bd2 Bg4
10. Na4 Qd6 11. Rc1 Rad8 {and the game Tari - Goh, Barcelona 2017 eventually
ended peacefully.}) 3... Bb4 (3... Nc6 {was my main preparation but here,
Magnus had played} 4. g4 $5 {against MVL during one of the Grand Chess Tours,
winning in brilliant style. I see absolutely no reason why I should try to
defend a position that MVL couldn't....}) 4. Nge2 O-O 5. a3 Be7 6. Ng3 ({
My very brief preparation continued} 6. d4 exd4 7. Qxd4 {(Controlling the d5
break is logical)} (7. Nxd4 d5 {leads to comfortable equality.}) 7... c6 $1 (
7... Nc6 {is an automatic move but after} 8. Qd1 {, Black is running the risk
of entering a slightly passive middlegame since the ...d5 break will be almost
impossible to achieve.}) 8. Nf4 Na6 $5 {with interesting play.}) 6... c6 (6...
d5 {was also possible and could have been a slightly smarter choice since I
ended up taking on d5 with the knight anyway.} 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. Qc2 Be6 (8... c5
9. Bc4 Nc7 $5) 9. Be2 (9. Nf5 Bf6 {is fine for Black}) 9... c5 {and Black has
equalised with chances of fighting for the initiative}) 7. d4 ({After the game,
Magnus and I briefly discussed} 7. Nf5 d5 8. Nxe7+ Qxe7 9. d4 exd4 10. Qxd4 Rd8
{and now the threat of ...c6-c5 gives Black good play in the centre.}) 7...
exd4 8. exd4 d5 9. cxd5 {Right around this moment, the guy sitting next to me
was checkmated with Qd1-h5. I then realised that this was going to be a more
difficult evening than expected...} Re8 $5 (9... Nxd5 10. Bd3 Re8 11. O-O Be6 {
was maybe also fine for Black but I thought that I should cleverly try to
prevent Bd3 if I could. Magnus's next move took me, and a lot of other strong
players by surprise.}) 10. Bd3 $5 {Ignoring the discovered check. Regardless
of the objective strength of the move, many players, including former National
Champion and Olympian IM Hsu Li Yang, considered this to be remarkable
especially given that this was played under simul conditions.} (10. dxc6 {
was my main worry, where I calculated} Nxc6 (10... Bc5+ 11. Be3 Bxd4 12. cxb7
Bxb7 {was also possible but I didn't really believe that such a dream could
materialise.}) 11. Be3 Ng4 {followed by vague ideas of ...Bf6 or ...Bg5.})
10... Bxa3+ 11. Nge2 Bf8 {It was difficult for me to decide an appropriate
retreat square for my bishop.} (11... Bb4 {is one of the engine's top choices,
but I didn't see what the bishop was doing on a square which my queen's knight
wanted for herself.}) (11... Bd6 {is logical but it reduces my control over
the d5 square}) ({while} 11... Be7 {has the idea of regrouping with ..Nd5 and .
.Bf6 but it also temporarily blocks the e-file. In the end, it was a matter of
weighing the various pros and cons.}) 12. dxc6 Nxc6 13. O-O Nb4 14. Bb1 Bg4 $6
{A natural but pseudo active move.} ({On hindsight,} 14... Be6 $5 {with the
idea} 15. Bg5 Bc4 {was strategically desirable especially since} 16. Ne4 {
can be met by} Be7 {followed by exchanges.}) 15. Bg5 (15. f3 $6 Be6 {was my
intention but Magnus was never going to give away squares without something
concrete in return.}) 15... Qb6 16. Qd2 Bxe2 {An important decision but
perhaps overtly hasty. I should also add that Magnus graciously allowed me to
"pass" when I asked for a bit more time at this juncture.} ({Taking a breather
with} 16... a6 $1 {would have solved a lot of my problems but I naively wanted
to play concretely at every juncture.}) 17. Nxe2 Ne4 18. Bxe4 Rxe4 19. Be3 Nd5
$2 {The first real mistake of the game, allowing Magnus to improve his pawn
structure.} ({It was really important to play} 19... a6 {now as it will soon
be clear.}) 20. Nc3 Nxe3 ({I didn't like} 20... Nxc3 21. bxc3 {as it appears
to give White far too much play on the queenside. In particular, moves like
Rb1 or Rc1 with the idea of pushing c4 spring to mind. It is worth mentioning
that Black would probably be positionally if he could play Qc6, a6 and b5 in a
row but organising this is far from straight forward.} {Having said that, the
position after} a5 $5 {might be better for White but Black retains a sliver of
counterplay, which is more than what he got in the game.}) 21. fxe3 Re6 $2 {
Not the best square for the rook, the reason to which will be explained in the
note to White's next move.} (21... Ree8 {with the idea} 22. Qf2 Qe6 {was
slightly better for White.}) 22. Qd3 $6 ({To my horror, I realised that my
original intention of meeting} 22. Qf2 {with} Rf6 $4 {could be met by} 23. Nd5
$1 Rxf2 24. Nxb6 Rxf1+ 25. Kxf1 Re8 26. Rxa7 Rxe3 27. Ra8 $1 {and White wins.
Maybe this was what Magnus missed.}) ({Instead, I was probably going to
continue} 22. Qf2 f6 23. Nd5 Qc6 24. Qf3 Rd8 25. e4 {with an unpleasant
position but at least Black is still alive.}) 22... Rae8 $2 {A horrendous
blunder, perhaps induced by the imposing speed of the World Champion or maybe
the 3 glasses of wine just before the game?} (22... Rd8 $1 {was of course my
original intention, when there is still everything to play for.}) 23. Nd5 Qd6
24. Qf5 $1 {Winning a pawn by force. Not an ideal situation against a World
Champion best known for his technical play.} Qd7 {It wasn't pleasant to miss a
simple 2-mover but there was no need to capitulate.} (24... f6 25. Rxa7 Qc6 $1
{with the idea of playing ..Rd6 and ..Qc2 would have given Black some
counterplay. I have to admit that this counter-intuitive manoeuvre was
machine-inspired and I would probably have missed even with a bit more time on
the clock.}) 25. Rxa7 Rd6 26. Qxd7 Rxd7 27. Ra5 $1 {Magnus displays his
flawless conversion technique from this juncture. As Olimpiu Urcan succintly
puts it, I was about to be subjected to severe medieval torture....} Red8 28.
Nc3 Re8 29. Rf3 Rc8 30. Rb5 g6 31. g4 $1 {stopping ..f7-f5 and keeping
absolute control on the kingside.} Be7 32. Kf2 Ra8 33. Ke2 Kg7 34. Kd3 Ra1 35.
h3 h6 36. e4 Rg1 37. e5 Re1 38. Nd5 Bg5 39. Kc4 Bd2 40. Rfb3 Rc1+ 41. Kd3 Bg5
42. Nc3 Rh1 43. Rxb7 Rxh3+ 44. Kc4 Rd8 45. Ne4 {And with his knight jumping to
d6, my kingside stymied by a solitary pawn on g4, and with his passed pawns
about to be set in motion, I've seen enough.} 1-0
