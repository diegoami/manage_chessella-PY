1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Bd3 Nf6 (5... d5 {is also playable, but Black's pieces get in a
little tangle after} 6. Qe2 Qe7 7. O-O {when c4 is in the offing, as well as
Re1, and Black does not have a clear way to develop without losing large
amounts of time on a queen trade.}) 6. O-O Be7 7. c3 O-O 8. Bc2 Bg4 {I
actually don't much like this move, although 1) it is obviously not bad, and 2)
I made an analogous call against Nigel Short once.} ({I would be interested in
why Black decided against the normal Petroff move} 8... d5 {when following
some normal re-grouping like ...Re8, ...c6, ...Nbd7-f8 White's small
initiative will dissipate all by itself.}) 9. h3 (9. d4 {works better
immediately, as White must have realised a bit later on in the game. The point
is that a White knight on g3 already suffices to put the question to a Black
bishop on g4, and furthermore, the answer 'Bh5' is not very sensible at that
point. Definitely Black would have had to play rather differently than in the
game.} Re8 $1 (9... c6 10. Re1 Na6 11. Nbd2 {may still just be alright (say 11.
..Bh5 with a passive but reasonable position) but certainly} Qd7 $6 {is not:}
12. Nf1 Rae8 13. Ng3 $14) 10. Nbd2 d5 11. Re1 Bd6 12. Rxe8+ Qxe8 13. Nf1 c6 14.
Be3 Nbd7 15. Ng3 g6 $11 {Black has made a good number of 'useful' moves and
can now give up the bishop pair with a clean conscience.}) 9... Bh5 10. d4 c6 (
10... d5 11. Re1 Re8 $11 {is obviously still fine too.}) 11. Re1 Na6 12. Nbd2
Qd7 {An interesting and in fact rather ambitious concept from Black. Just as a
2500 might play the Modern rather than the Caro-Kann in an attempt to outclass
a 2350, here Anish is deliberately leaving the pawn-structure fluid to leave
more room to outplay his opponent.} 13. Nf1 (13. Ne4 Nxe4 14. Bxe4 Nc7 {
might have been what Black was hoping for, and now the play becomes a bit
messy. He has ideas of ...f5 in some positions, and will be able to meet d5
with ...c5.}) 13... Rae8 14. Ng3 {The analogous position without h3 or ...Bh5
would have been troublesome for Black, but here he is just fine.} Bg6 15. Bxg6
hxg6 16. Qb3 Bd8 (16... Nc7 $11 {is both clever and spectacularly unnecessary.}
) 17. Bg5 Nd5 {Now the bishops are gone, Black has a little bit less to play
with.} (17... Bb6 $5 {would have been a slightly interesting attempt from
Black. He would like ...Nc7-e6 next, forcing an imbalance in kingside
structures and minor pieces.} 18. a4 d5 19. Ne5 Qc8 $132) 18. Bxd8 Rxd8 19. Ne4
(19. c4 $5 Nf6 20. Ne4 {and White can once again think about being the one
with a microscopic nibble.}) 19... Rfe8 20. Qa3 Nf6 (20... Nac7 $5 21. c4 Nf4
$132 {would have been the last way to inject some life into the game; White's
structure is at risk of having holes punched in it by (say) ...b6 and ...d5.})
21. Nxf6+ gxf6 22. d5 c5 23. Qb3 Kg7 {Now both sides probably thought the game
would be drawn without further oversights or adventures. Indeed, the position
looks ripe for massive trades, and the draw can perhaps be made with only
queens and pawns on each side.} 24. c4 Rxe1+ 25. Rxe1 Re8 26. a3 Rxe1+ 27. Nxe1
Nb8 28. Nc2 Qe7 29. Qe3 Qe5 30. Qb3 $6 {But that doesn't excuse carelessness!
I suspect this move was looking for a repetition, but instead White drifts
into real danger.} (30. Qxe5 fxe5 31. f3 f5 32. Kf2 a6 33. a4 $11 {locks down
the position and draws, although White still needs to use a bit more care.})
30... b6 $1 31. Ne3 f5 32. Qa4 a6 33. b4 $2 (33. g3 Kf8 34. b4 f4 35. gxf4 Qxf4
$15 {was necessary, if a tiny bit unpleasant due to pawn-islands.}) 33... f4
34. Nf1 Kf8 {Probably Anish was not on the lookout for a truly serious chance,
after playing a super-solid Black Petroff game.} (34... Qe1 $1 $17 {and
despite the fact that both knights are immobilised, White is actually in a lot
of trouble.} 35. bxc5 bxc5 36. Qb3 Nd7 37. Qa4 {is of course not a repetition
now, because} Ne5 38. Qxa6 Nd3 {forces mate.}) 35. bxc5 {After the near-miss,
White bails out and forces a repetition.} dxc5 36. Qb3 Nd7 37. Qa4 Nb8 38. Qb3
Nd7 39. Qa4 1/2-1/2
