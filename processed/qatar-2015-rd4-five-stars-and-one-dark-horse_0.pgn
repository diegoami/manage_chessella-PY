Nc6 9. Qd3 Nb4 $5 $146 {This move was made quite quickly by Magnus and hence he
was clearly prepared.} 10. Qd2 h6 11. Bxf6 Bxf6 12. Nd5 $6 (12. a3 {is met by}
Bg5 13. Qd1 Nc6 14. O-O Be6 15. Qd3 O-O 16. Rad1 $11 {And White has a much
better position than what happened in the game.}) 12... Nxd5 13. Qxd5 Qc7 14.
O-O-O Be7 15. Kb1 Be6 16. Qd3 O-O $15 {Black has a very pleasant position due
to the following reasons: 1. He has the bishop pair. Although the bishop on e7
is not particularly great it can be activated either on g5 or after White plays
f4 it can be strong on the a1-h8 diagonal. 2. The d5 square is weak, however
the knight on b3 is at least three moves away from it and cannot really take
advantage of it. 3. And last but not the least Black has a clear plan of attack
on the queenside with b5-b4, a5-a4. White also can push his pawns down the
board but somehow he lacks the firepower in that zone.} 17. f4 exf4 18. Nd4 Bd7
19. Rhf1 Bf6 20. Rxf4 Be5 {The bishop on e5 is really strong now.} 21. Rff1
Rac8 22. c3 b5 23. Nf3 Be6 24. Nd4 Bc4 25. Qf3 b4 $1 {White's king position is
slowly but surely getting ripped open where as White has not yet started his
play on the kingside.} 26. cxb4 Qb6 $1 27. Bxc4 Rxc4 28. Nc2 Rfc8 {The f7 pawn
is not really so important as the king can hide safely on f7. Yet it made sense
to take the pawn and then play Rd2.} 29. Rd2 (29. Qxf7+ Kh8 30. Rd2 Qc6 31. Qf2
Qxe4 (31... a5 {was played by Magnus in the game.}) 32. Re2 $14 {And White
should defend this position and might well be slightly better.}) 29... Qc6
(29... Qc7 $1) 30. Qxf7+ Kh8 31. Qf2 a5 32. a3 $2 (32. bxa5 {is a computer move
but it looks extremely scary and I won't be surprised if there is a mate
somewhere around the corner.} Rb8 33. b3 Rc3 $40) 32... axb4 33. Nxb4 Qxe4+ 34.
Ka2 Rxb4 $1 35. axb4 Ra8+ 36. Kb3 Rb8 37. Ka2 Qxb4 {The queen, rook and bishop
combine to launch a winning attack against the White king.} 38. Rc1 Qa4+ 39.
Kb1 Qe4+ 40. Rcc2 Bxb2 41. Qf3 Qe1+ 42. Rd1 Bd4+ (42... Bd4+ 43. Kc1 Be3+ {with
a winning position. A fine game by Magnus Carlsen who had very little
difficulty in crushing his talented young opponent.}) 0-1
