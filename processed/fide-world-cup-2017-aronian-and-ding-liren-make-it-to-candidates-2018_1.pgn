bxc3  c5  8. e3  cxd4 {[%emt 0:00:02] Over here Ding Liren started to think for
quite some time. Aronian has played this position with white and has gone for
the move exd4. Ding Liren decided this was a good opportunity to just call it a
day, recover from the shock of the previous round and get ready for the
10'+10'' tiebreaks. Hence, he offered a draw.} 9. Bxf6  1/2-1/2
