 b4  16. Nd1  Qf8 $1 {120 Not only preventing White from exchanging off the
monster bishop on g7, but prepares an h6-h5 of his own to force White's pieces
back.} 17. Nf2  h6  18. Be3  h5  19. Rfe1  a5 $6 {681 A strange decision. On
the one hand, Black wants to secure the b6 square for his knight where it will
have a good range of action, but on the other, it gives White's (very) bad
bishop a lovely square on b5.} 20. Bb5  Bb7  21. Nf1  Rec8  22. Rac1  Nb6  23.
Qc2  Nfd7 {75 Black's plan is clear and White seems to have given up on his
central expansion, usually prepared via f4-e5. Instead Black has the initiative
now and is threatening ... c4 after which he will be doing very well.} 24. Nd2
$2 {54 Quite simply a mistake. Yes, it aims at the c4 square, but not it does
not prevent ...c4 from being played.} (24. b3 $1 {was obligatory, after which
it would be a complicated struggle still, with a small edge for White thanks to
his space advantage.}) 24... c4 $1 {93 Now, not only has Black equalized, he is
probably a bit better.} 25. Qb1  c3  26. bxc3  Bxc3  27. Nd1  Bxd2  28. Bxd2 
Rxc1  29. Bxc1 {83 In spite of having played his dream breakthrough with ...c4,
White is still fine, and mostly because of that bishop on b5. It shows how a
small mistake can still have long reaching consequences.} Nc5 $1 {7 The purpose
of ths move is not simply to plant the knight on a nice square, but to prepare
Ba6 and trade off that bishop on b5. If it goes down, the a4 pawn may also
fall.} 30. Nb2 $2 {123 White is clearly rattled at the way he lost control of
the game. This is not how the top-seed 2600 player envisioned it at the start
of the day.} (30. Be3 {was the only move to prevent an immediate ...Ba6.})
30... Ba6  31. Bxa6  Nxa6  32. Be3  Nc5 {43 Simply put: White is in a world of
pain.} 33. Qd1  Qe8  34. Bxc5 $2 {153 This only forestalls the loss of the pawn
for a couple of moves, and instead brings in new issues, such as two monster
connected passed pawns. White is panicking.} dxc5  35. Qb3  Qe5  36. Rd1  Qc3
$1 {77 Black has now calculated the win to the end.} 37. Qxc3  bxc3  38. Nd3 
c2  39. Rc1 {7 [#] Black had foreseen this next shot already when he played
36...Qc3.} Nxd5 $3  40. Rxc2  ({After} 40. exd5 Rb1 41. Rg1 {Forced since the
threat was ...c4, evicting the knight from the rook's protection.} Rd1 $1 42.

very elegant} 43. Rc1 b2 44. Rb1 Rc8 $3 {and there is no defense against
...Rc1}) 0-1
