{I was privileged to watch this game live: Adams' technique was quite
something, even at this time control.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6
5. O-O d6 6. c3 O-O 7. a4 a5 (7... a6 {is marginally more played, and for some
reason here White no longer plays with Bg5. A fairly recent high-level test
continued} 8. Nbd2 Ba7 9. h3 Ne7 10. Re1 Ng6 11. Bb3 Re8 12. d4 h6 13. Bc2 {
and now Black may have gone slightly astray with} c6 $6 14. Nf1 d5 {This is
always a double-edged idea; there are lots of examples from all over the Ruy
Lopez where it immediately equalises, and equally many where it ends up
weakening the dark squares to a crippling extent.} 15. Nxe5 Nxe5 16. dxe5 Nxe4

8. Bg5 Qe7 9. Nbd2 ({Black's idea is that after} 9. d4 Bb6 10. d5 Nb8 {White
has gained space in the typical Ruy fashion, but the a5-pawn anchors the
b6-bishop in position, and consolidates a grip on the c5-square, and therefore
it is White who should think about hurriedly equalising the position.}) 9...
Be6 10. Qb3 Rab8 11. Rad1 h6 {Around here, the psychology behind the two
players' alternating decisions becomes quite interesting. As an educated
outsider, the only thing I can say is that Black probably started thinking
about winning the game at an inopportune time.} 12. Bh4 ({Following} 12. Bxe6 {
Black would probably (correctly) recapture immediately with the pawn:} fxe6 13.
Be3 Nd7 $11) 12... Ba7 13. Bxe6 Qxe6 {Morally committing to the doubled f-pawn
structure.} (13... fxe6 $11 {was still the correct recapture, in my opinion.})
14. Bxf6 $1 Qxb3 (14... Qxf6 15. Nc4 $14 {is unpleasant- White will follow up
with Qb5 and be material up before Black even gets started; or alternatively
play d4; or finally there is Ne3-d5 to think about.}) 15. Nxb3 gxf6 16. Nbd2
Rfd8 17. Nh4 Ne7 {The position is still objectively almost balanced, but the
momentum has moved over to White, in any game between competent players of
equal strength.} 18. Nc4 b5 19. Nxa5 Bb6 $6 (19... bxa4 20. Rd2 a3 $5 21. bxa3

line without delay.}) 23... Ra8 (23... Rdb8 $5 $11 {is a bizarre computer move
that seems to improve- delaying taking either a-pawn until after Black has
made some more useful moves, such as ...c6 or ...Kg7.}) 24. Rb1 Rxa4 25. Rfc1 {
At this point Luke took a good 4 minutes or so to make his choice, lowering
his time from 7 to 3 minutes...} c5 {The braver decision, but the pawn move
would be obligated sooner or later.} (25... Ra7 26. Rb8+ Kg7 27. Re8 c5 28. Rb1
Rb4 29. Ra1 Kh7 $8 $14 {White has a very annoying pull here. Even the likely
set of endgames with every pawn west of the half-way line being swept away is
no panacea for Black.}) 26. Rb6 Rd8 (26... R8xa5 27. Rxd6 Ra1 28. Rxa1 Rxa1+
