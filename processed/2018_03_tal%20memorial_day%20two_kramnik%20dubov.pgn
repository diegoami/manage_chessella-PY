1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O d5 6. c3 $5 {If the d5 c6
formation in Grunfeld can be good for Black, this has to be good for White!} c6
7. Nbd2 Nbd7 8. Re1 c5 9. a4 {For a player like me this move makes not much
sense. Why a4? Well Kramnik would have wanted to gain more space on the
queenside with a5. You can always understand the moves in hindsight, but if
you got this position, would you play a4? I am not so sure!} cxd4 10. cxd4 a5
11. Nb1 $1 {Of course the knight will stand better on c3.} Nb8 12. Nc3 Nc6 {
We have nearly full symmetry apart from the fact that White has the extra Re1
on the board. This is because Black lost a tempo with c6-c5.} 13. Ne5 Bf5 14.
Bg5 Nb4 15. Rc1 Ne4 16. Be3 Nxc3 $6 {Dubov's idea clearly was bxc3 Na2, but he
missed something there.} 17. bxc3 $1 (17. Rxc3 Rc8 $11) 17... Nc6 (17... Na2
18. g4 $1 {This is a stronger move.} (18. Rc2 $5 {This is what Dubov missed as
Kramnik said after the game.} Bxc2 19. Qxc2 Bxe5 20. dxe5 d4 21. Bxd4 Nb4 {
Somehow the knight escapes, but White has excellent compensation anyway.})
18... Nxc1 19. gxf5 Na2 20. Qd2 $1 Bxe5 21. dxe5 d4 22. Bxd4 $18 {Now Nb4
doesn't make sense as the bishop on d4 is protected.}) 18. Qb3 $14 {White
already has a tangible edge.} Bxe5 (18... e6 {According to Kramnik would have
kept Black's disadvantage to a minimum.}) 19. dxe5 Be4 20. Bxe4 dxe4 21. e6 $1
Qc8 22. Bh6 {Black loses an exchange and with it the game.} f5 23. Bxf8 Qxf8
24. Qxb7 Ne5 25. Qd5 Ng4 26. h3 Nf6 27. Qe5 Qh6 28. Kg2 {Quite an easy win for
the Big Vlad.} 1-0
