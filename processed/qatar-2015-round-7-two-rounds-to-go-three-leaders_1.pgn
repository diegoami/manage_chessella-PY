1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Bg2 Nb6 6. e3 $5 {This line with
e3 is not common but has been seen many times in the past and hence is not
really a surprise.} Nc6 7. Nge2 Qd3 $5 {An idea borrowed from the game
Svidler-Nepomniachtchi, Russian Championships 2011. Try finding the game to see
the similar contours to this move.} 8. f4 f6 9. Be4 Qa6 {This entire white
strategy of Qd8-d3-a6 looks quite suspect.} 10. fxe5 fxe5 11. Ng1 $1 {Of course
Mamedyarov undevelops! After seeing his games from this tournament we all know
that we can always expect something unexpected from him!} (11. O-O { would be
unambitious and would give Black a fine position after} Bg4 {and 0-0-0 coming
up.}) 11... Nd7 12. Nd5 (12. Qh5+ g6 13. Bxg6+ hxg6 14. Qxh8 Nb4 $1 $17 {was
Ganguly's idea.}) 12... Bd6 13. Qh5+ Kd8 14. Nf3 Nc5 15. Qg5+ Ne7 $1 16. Nxe7
Bxe7 17. Qxe5 {White has won a pawn, but the black king is safe on d8 and Black
can quickly get his pieces in to the game.} Rf8 18. Rf1 Qc4 $2 ( 18... Bd7
{with the idea of Nxe4 and Bc6 could be quite strong as after} 19. d4 Nxe4 20.
Qxe4 Bc6 21. d5 Qa5+ 22. Bd2 Qxd5 $17 {Black is just better.}) 19. Bxh7 Bh3 20.
Rf2 $16 Bf6 21. Qf4 Nd3+ 22. Bxd3 Qxd3 23. g4 {Mamedyarov plays this phase of
the game quite well and has a tangible edge. But in such wild positions you can
never really have a stable assessment as humans are always prone to errors.}
Qd7 24. Ne5 Qd5 25. Ng6 Qh1+ 26. Ke2 Qg1 27. Nxf8 { Mamedyarov has won a rook
but now has to be careful against Black's counter attack.} Bxg4+ 28. Kd3 Ke8
{Making some space for the rook to come to d8. Now the next move is extremely
easy for the computer to see but almost impossible for the humans to play.} 29.
Rf1 {The more human approach.} (29. b3 $3 Rd8+ ( 29... Bxa1 $2 30. Qe4+ $1 Kd8
31. Ng6 $18 {A check on e7 with the queen and rook on f8 are threatened. Black
is busted.}) 30. Kc4 $1 {The white king boldly moves around as if he is in a
park. But there is absolutely no way to get to the king. He will escape.} Qd1
31. Qe4+ Kf7 (31... Kxf8 32. Ba3+ $18 { [%cal Ga1d1]}) 32. Rxf6+ gxf6 33. Qg6+
Ke7 34. Ba3+ $18) 29... Rd8+ 30. Kc2 Qg2 31. Nh7 $2 {An extremely bad move by
Mamedyarov, who hands over the advantage to Black in just one move. It is a
little unfair to condemn the play in such a complicated position with clocks
ticking. It really is not easy.} Be2 $2 { This gives White an option to
sacrifice his rook and wriggle out.} (31... Qc6+ 32. Kb1 Be2 {was the right
move order as after} 33. Nxf6+ gxf6 {Bd3+ is an unstoppable threat and White
will have to part with a huge chunk of his material advantage.} 34. a3 (34. b3
Bd3+ 35. Kb2 Rd6 $3 $19 {[%cal Gc6c2,Gd6a6] Once again not easy to see, but it
does exist.}) 34... Bd3+ 35. Ka2 Qc2 $19 { and Bc4+ will claim the queen.}) 32.
Nxf6+ gxf6 33. b3 $1 Bd3+ (33... Qc6+ 34. Kb2 Bd3 35. Qxf6 Qc2+ 36. Ka3 {is
absolutely nothing now.}) 34. Kb2 Bxf1 35. Qxc7 $16 {White is better now. His
king is safer and he is two pawns up.} Bd3 36. Ka3 Bf5 37. Bb2 Qxd2 38. Bxf6
Qd6+ {Unfortunately Ganguly had to exchange the queens.} 39. Qxd6 Rxd6 40. Bd4
{White is two pawns up although due to the opposite coloured bishop endgame it
seems a tad difficult to convert this position. However in the end Mamedyarov
did that and moved into the lead.} Ra6+ 41. Kb4 Be4 42. a4 Rh6 43. Ra2 a6 44.
