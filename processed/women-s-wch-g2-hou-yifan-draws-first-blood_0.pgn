1. e4 e5 {Taking a page out of her opponent's book?! Mariya is not known for
being an 1...e5 player either, and is much more used to playing a Sicilian.} 2.
Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 {The few times that Muzychuk has
defended the black side of the Spanish, she always chose the open variation
with 5...Nxe4.} 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Be3 {Not the mainline, which
nowadays is arguably 9.Nbd2 slightly over 9.c3, but still a move that has been
seen more and more in recent years.} Be7 10. c3 O-O 11. Nbd2 Qd7 12. Bc2 Nxd2
13. Qxd2 Bg4 14. Bf4 $5 {A fascinating strategical decision. Hou Yifan decides
that she does not want to retain the integrity in her pawn structure, and
allows Muzychuk to shatter it. On the flipside, the Chinese player obtains the
pair of bishops and the potential of playing f4-f5.} Bxf3 {Otherwise the bishop
on g4 looks silly.} 15. gxf3 Rad8 16. Rfd1 {The position has many dynamic
factors. If Black was able to set up a pawn on f5, a knight on e6 and push c6
she would be better, without a doubt. Those maneuvers, however, take a long
time, and Hou Yifan needs to make sure she is in time to react with something
active.} Qe6 (16... f5 $2 17. Bb3 $16) 17. Qe3 Rd7 {Defending the pawn on c7,
but the move looks slightly clumsy.} (17... f5 $2 18. exf6 Qxf6 19. Bxc7 {is
not possible just yet.}) (17... Na5 $5 {Is a very interesting suggestion by the
computer, aiming at playing Nc4 and a quick f5.} 18. b3 c5 { doesn't look good
for White.}) 18. Bg3 g6 $2 {This move I have to condemn. I don't see any
scenario where the move g6 is useful for Black, as the move truly does little
to diminish White's ambition to push f4-f5. If Black was preventing some kind
of Qd3 move, she should have waited until White committed this move to defend
against the checkmate.} (18... f5 19. exf6 Qxf6 20. a4 { looks good for White.
Notice that Qxf3 is impossible, and the opening of the queenside is dangerous.}
Qxf3 21. Qe6+) (18... Na5 {again, was probably better. }) 19. a4 Nd8 {Muzychuk
has a clear plan, but it is simply too slow} (19... b4 20. a5 bxc3 21. bxc3
$14) (19... Na5 $5) 20. axb5 axb5 21. f4 f6 {Otherwise f5 follow} 22. exf6 Qxf6
23. Qe2 $1 {A nice geometrical motif} (23. f5 gxf5 24. Be5 Qe6 {is some
computer line that is not immediately obvious to me why it works.}) 23... c6
{Black has to defend b5.} 24. Qg4 {And this is the point. There is no way to
defend the rook on d7 without allowing f5.} Rb7 25. f5 $16 Bd6 26. Ra6 $1
{Putting pressure on the sixth rank. White has play al l over the board} Rg7 $1
{Swinging the rook into action is the best chance.} 27. fxg6 Bc5 $2 (27... Bxg3
28. Qxg3 hxg6 (28... Qe6 $5 $16 {and the game keeps going as Black will take on
g6 next move.}) 29. Rxd5 $18 cxd5 30. Rxf6 Rxf6 31. Qe5) 28. Kg2 {Protecting
f2} hxg6 $2 (28... Bxf2 29. Rf1 $18) (28... Qe7 {was better, but Black's
position is quite bad.}) 29. Rxd5 {Now it is all over} Bxf2 (29... cxd5 30.
Rxf6 Rxf6 31. Qg5 {costs Black material}) 30. Bb3 $1 {Other moves won too, but
this is a nice finishing blow} Ne6 31. Rd6 Bc5 32. Qxe6+ { A relatively
one-sided game in which Hou Yifan showed excellent positional mastery.} 1-0
