Rad1 Qc7 {A new move, and an improvement over Rc8 which had been played twice before.} 15. Rd7 Qxf4 16. gxf4 Bc6 17. Ng5 Bxd7 18. Bxa8 Bxc3 19. Rxd7 Bxb2 20. Be4 h6 21. Nf3 Nxc4 22. Rxa7 {An endgame that has arisen basically by force. The opposite colored bishops have drawish tendencies, but since White has a slight initiatve with the more powerful rook and some temporary back rank problems, it is Black that has to be precise in order to fully equalize.} Rc8 23. Kg2 Bf6 24. Bd3 g5 25. f5 g4 26. Ne1 $1 e5 27. Nc2 h5 28. Nb4 Kg7 29. Nd5 {The transfer of the knight was slow, but it is clear that on d5 it pressures both sides of the board and it is quite annoying. } Bh4 (29... Nd2 {is some computer suggestion I would never have come up with.} 30. Nxb6 Rc1 {with apparent counterplay (?)}) 30. h3 $1 {More precision from Nepo.} Rc5 (30... gxh3+ 31. Kxh3 Bxf2 $2 (31... Bg5 32. e3 $1 {and Black's position is certainly unpleasant. Be2 is a threat, among others.}) 32. f6+ Kf8 33. Ne7 {Black's king is in some trouble and White has a big initiative. It's possible he is already winning.} Rd8 34. Nf5 $1 (34. Bxc4 $1 b5 {is a miraculous defense for Black, but it also loses.} 35. Ng6+ $1 fxg6 36. Rf7+ Ke8 37. Re7+ Kf8 38. Rh7 $1 $18)) 31. hxg4 hxg4 32. Nc7 $1 Kh6 33. Ne8 $1 {Again with the knight maneuvers!} Nb2 34. Be4 Nd1 $1 {A counter maneuver, making some threats on the kingside.} 35. Nd6 $1 Kg5 36. Rxf7 (36. e3 Ra5 $1 {is still not so clear.}) 36... Bxf2 $2 {The decisive mistake in time pressure.} ( 36... Nxf2 $1 {Holds the position, for example:} 37. Rh7 Kf4 $1 {A tough move to find, but its enough for a draw. Further variations and proof of this will be found in a future ChessBase Magazine!}) 37. Rg7+ Kf4 38. e3+ $1 {The tactical coup de grace.} (38. f6 Bh4 {White has real problems with his king, which is what e3 solves.}) 38... Kxe3 (38... Nxe3+ 39. Kxf2 {obviously loses.}) (38... Bxe3 39. f6 {and the pawn is running down the board.}) 39. Rxg4 Kd2 40. Bf3 Ne3+ 41. Kxf2 Nxg4+ 42. Bxg4 {The rook is no match for the pieces and it cannot hold down the passed pawn.} Rd5 43. Ne4+ Kd3 44. f6 Ra5 (44... Kxe4 45. Bf3+ Kf5 46. Bxd5 Kxf6 {and the a-pawn is the correct color.}) 45. Be2+ Kd4 ( 45... Kxe4 46. f7 Ra8 47. Bf3+) 46. f7 Ra8 47. Ng5 {The culminating move is by Nepo's wonderful traveling knight. A great game!} 1-0
