{Ding Liren was in a must win situation as he had lost the first game with
black against Aronian.} 1. d4  Nf6  2. c4  e6  3. Nf3  d5  4. Nc3  Bb4  5. cxd5
 exd5  6. Bf4  c6  7. e3  Bf5  8. Be2  O-O  9. O-O  Be7 {[%emt 0:00:03] After
this move Ding was out of his preparation as he said after the game.} 10. Nh4

a5  14. g4 $5 {[%emt 0:00:45] This move is doubled edged. It gains space and
has some aggresive intentions but Black is very solid and can defend without
too much trouble.} Nbd7  15. g5  Ne8  16. e4 {[%emt 0:00:02] Something seems to
be wrong with White's play . He first pushed the pawn in front of his king and
later broke in the centre. That's what a must win game can do to you.} dxe4

19. Be5  Nd5 {[%emt 0:00:59] Over the last few moves Black has consolidated his
position, but White has been able to create imbalance which helps him continue
to play ambitiously.} 20. Bg4  Kh8 $6  (20... Nef6 $1 21. gxf6 gxf6 22. Bh2 f5
23. Bxf5 gxf5 24. Nc3 $13) (20... Nd6 21. Nc5 $14) 21. Rae1 $1 {[%emt 0:01:29]
White is not just better. He has all his pieces well placed and we can hope
that he could have taken advantage of it. But it was not to be.} Nef6 $5 {[%emt
0:04:31] This move is a little too late. White has a way to keep his
advantage.} (21... f5 22. gxf6 gxf6 23. Ng5 fxe5 24. Ne6 Qd7 25. Qxg6 $18) 22.

wanted to play this during the game. This move is also very strong.})) 23... f5

Rxh4  28. Nxf5  Rh7  29. Nxe7  Nxe7  30. Re5 {[%emt 0:00:01] Ding would like to
exchange his rooks via h5, but Levon's next move stops that.} Nf5 $1  (30...

Levon does is much better.}) 33. Rg1+  Kf6 { [%emt 0:00:01] A historic game.
This gave us the new World Cup champion - the first man in the history of the
game to have won the World Cup twice.} 0-1
