Obviously,} 7... Nc6 8. c4 ({Perhaps Carlsen planned} 8. Nbd2) 8... Nb4 { is
main line theory, but Granda always seeks his own ways.}) 8. c4 ({Perhaps he
had a point, as now the modern treatment} 8. Nbd2 {isn't effective without the
black knight misplaced on c6.}) 8... Nf6 9. Nc3 {Carlsen is happy to play a
standard IQP position, which may also come out of teh the exchange French with
3.c4, albeit here White is a tempo ahead.} Nc6 ({Against Adams back in 2008
Julio went} 9... dxc4 10. Bxc4 Nbd7 {leading essentually to the same thing
after} 11. Re1 Nb6 12. Bb3 c6 {etc. That game ended in a draw, but today Granda
faced a tougher test.}) 10. cxd5 Nb4 11. Re1 Nbxd5 12. h3 c6 13. a3 { [#]
Somehow this type of position is harder to defend than its sister type with the
black pawn on e6. Bc8 has no squares to go to, and White faces no pressure on
the c-file.} Re8 {That rook is better off staying put to keep the f7-pawn cozy
and warm.} ({The strength of White's position is well illustrated by a typical
sac} 13... h6 14. Qc2 Be6 15. Rxe6 $5 {not forced} fxe6 16. Qe2 $14 {which has
been seen in GM practice.}) ({I'd recommend avoiding the h7-h6 move
altogether.} 13... Qc7 14. Qc2 (14. Bc2 Bd6 15. Qd3 g6 16. Bh6 Rd8 17. Bg5 Rf8
{aiming at ...Bf5 or ...Bf4}) 14... Bd6 $1 (14... h6 15. Ne5 Be6 16. Bd2 Rad8
17. Qc1 {with a hard to meet threat of Bxh6.}) (14... g6 15. Bh6 Rd8 16. Bg5
Be6 {and again White can consider} 17. Rxe6 fxe6 {this time with} 18. Bxg6 {to
follow.}) 15. Ne5 (15. Nxd5 cxd5 16. Qxc7 Bxc7 17. Bg5 Ne4 $1 {A typical pawn
sac to alleviate the pressure. Black has good chances to hold, even against
Magnus Carlsen.}) 15... Be6 {Now, as the e-file is blocked it is safe to play
this move.} 16. f4 Rad8 {etc.}) 14. Qc2 h6 15. Nxd5 Nxd5 16. Ne5 Bd6 { [#]}
(16... Nf6 17. Bc4 Nd5 18. Qb3 Qb6 19. Qg3 $1 {and once again Black comes to
regret the h7-h6 move.} ({Of course,} 19. Bxd5 $2 cxd5 20. Qxd5 Be6 21. Qe4
Rad8 {is a dream position for Black.})) 17. Bh7+ $1 {It's one thing when a rank
beginner gives a check like this, but a whole different ballgame when it's done
by the World Champion.} Kf8 18. Bd2 {The thing is, Black can hardly consider
trading on e5 because the a3-f8 diagonal must be guarded.} Be6 19. Re2 {[#]}
Nf6 $2 {Played after a long think, and as it often happens, it turned out to be
wrong.} ({Black's main priority is to get his pieces out. Granted, after} 19...
Qf6 20. f4 Rad8 (20... Nxf4 $2 21. Bxf4 Qxf4 22. Ng6+ fxg6 23. Rf1 ) 21. Rf1
{he remains under pressure, but there are no threats yet, so he continues with}
Bc7 {and hopes for the best.}) 20. Rae1 Qc7 {[#]} (20... Bd5 21. Bf4 a5 22. Qd3
a4 23. Qg3 {and it's about to crack open.}) {Now the game is going to be
decided by simple means.} 21. Ng6+ $1 fxg6 22. Rxe6 Nxh7 (22... Rxe6 23. Rxe6
Nxh7 24. Rxd6 {will win the g6-pawn anyway.}) 23. Rxe8+ Rxe8 24. Rxe8+ Kxe8 25.
Qxg6+ Kd8 ({After the objectively best} 25... Kf8 26. Qxh7 Qf7 27. Qe4 Kg8 28.
g3 {Magnus would have faced a technical task. Anyone to bet against him?}) 26.
Qxh7 Qe7 27. g3 Kc7 28. Qg6 {Julio didn't bother trying to delay the
inevitable.} 1-0
