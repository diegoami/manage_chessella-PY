He was able to beat Anish Giri after his streak of 43 unbeaten classical games, and that too with the black pieces! But as we shall see Svidler didn't really have to try too hard, Anish just self destructed.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {With the Berlin gaining in popularity, it is a refreshing change to see the main line of the Ruy Lopez. } 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 (5... b5 {is what Svidler tried against Karjakin in the Russian Championships 2015. But today being such an important game, he tries to be more solid.}) 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. c3 {Giri does not fear the Marshall Gambit.} d6 {Staying true to his strategy of playing solid chess, Svidler doesn't opt for the Marshall.} (8... d5 {Out of 28 games that Svidler has reached this position, he has tried 8...d5 in 12 games.}) 9. h3 Bb7 { Played after three minutes of thought. This is explained by the fact that Svidler has played literally every possible line in this position - ...Na5, ... Re8,...Nb8,...Nd7 and even....h6.} 10. d4 Re8 11. Nbd2 (11. Ng5 Rf8 12. Nf3 { is a common way to make a draw.}) 11... exd4 {We can call this the Svidler line because the Russian is by far the strongest player to have played this line. He has tried it twice in 2015 against strong players like Motylev and Yu Yangyi and both the games ended in a draw. The interesting point is that Svidler played this after a long think of seven minutes while Giri was blitzing out his moves.} (11... Bf8 {is the main move and out of the nearly 3050 positions reached here, 2900 have continued with this move.}) 12. cxd4 Nd7 13. Nf1 Na5 14. Bc2 Bf6 {This is the reason why the bishop is not put on f8. It will be more active on f6. While both of Svidler's opponents played Bf4 in this position, Giri improvised with Rb1.} 15. Rb1 {This has been played in five games before and the speed with which Giri played showed that he was well prepared for this line. The idea is to play b3 and stop the knight from coming to c4.} c5 (15... g6 16. b3 $1 {The knight on a5 is stranded.}) 16. d5 (16. b4 {was played by Iordachescu but black shouldn't be worse after} cxb4 17. N1h2 Rc8 $15 {1-0 (34) Iordachescu,V (2590)-Kjartansson,G (2484) Jerusalem 2015}) 16... Nc4 {The knight heads to e5 before b3 can be played.} 17. b3 Nce5 18. N3h2 $5 {This move makes complete sense. Black has less space and hence exchanges are avoided. The knight on e5 might not have such a good square to go to after 19.f4.} Ng6 19. Ng3 Bc8 {The bishop was doing nothing on b7 and hence is rerouted to a better diagonal. At this point Svidler had already used up more than half of his alloted time while Giri seemed like he was still in his preparation.} 20. Rf1 {By moving away the rook, Bc3 will no longer come with the tempo and now the threat is to play Ng4.} (20. Ng4 {looks like a natural move.} Bc3 21. Rf1 Nde5 22. Ne3 Nf4 23. Nef5 Neg6 {Black has a perfectly acceptable position.}) 20... Nb6 (20... Nde5 21. f4 Nd7 22. Ng4 $36) 21. Ng4 {First real think of the game for Giri.} Bxg4 22. hxg4 (22. Qxg4 {is not in the spirit of the position.} Ne5 23. Qe2 g6 $11 {Black is completely fine here.}) 22... h6 23. Nf5 Ne7 24. Ne3 {Once again avoiding exchanges makes complete sense as White has more space.} b4 (24... c4 {is another way to create counterplay but after} 25. bxc4 bxc4 26. f4 $14 {White is clearly better.}) 25. g3 {The idea of Kg2 followed by Rh1 is very natural in this position.} a5 26. Kg2 a4 {Svidler has been able to create counterplay on the queenside and White hasn't really made any headway on the kingside or in the center.} 27. bxa4 $6 {I don't really like this move spoiling your own structure. But Giri is well aware about the positional concession and yet he decided to go for this.} (27. Bd3 axb3 28. axb3 Ra2 29. Re1 $14 {With the idea of Re2 neutralising the pressure should give White a small edge.}) 27... Qd7 28. Qd3 Ng6 (28... Nxa4 {is the computer's way of playing chess.} 29. e5 Bxe5 30. Qh7+ Kf8 31. Re1 $44 {should give White enough compensation and no human player would allow the queen to infiltrate in to h7.}) 29. Nf5 (29. a3 {was the last chance to get rid of the a-pawn weakness.} Nxa4 (29... bxa3 30. Rxb6 $18) 30. axb4 Ne5 31. Qd2 Nxg4 $13) 29... Nxa4 {The pawn is recovered, White has no attack on the kingside and Black is simply better.} 30. Bxa4 Rxa4 {Giri had lot of chances to play a3 and get rid of his a2 pawn. But he did not do that. Now he has to live with that weakness.} 31. Rh1 Ne7 (31... Rxa2 {There is nothing wrong with taking this pawn but Svidler might have been afraid of} 32. g5 $5 {An interesting pawn sacrifice.} hxg5 (32... Bxg5 33. Bxg5 hxg5 34. Qf3 f6 35. Rh2 $40) 33. Qf3 {With the idea of Qh5 is dangerous but can be defended with accurate play.} Re5 $1 34. Qh5 Rxf5 $1 35. exf5 Qxf5 $19) 32. g5 (32. Nxh6+ gxh6 33. Qf3 Bg7 34. Bxh6 Ng6 $19 {With no real attack.}) 32... hxg5 33. Ne3 Rxa2 {Black wins a second pawn. True that the h-file is open but how exactly to make use of that?} 34. Bd2 Ng6 35. Nf5 (35. Rh2 Ne5 36. Rbh1 g6 $19 {and all the threats have been averted.}) 35... Ne5 36. Qe2 g6 37. Nh6+ Kg7 38. Nf5+ Kg8 39. Nh6+ Kg7 {Svidler repeats the position to reach the 40th move mark.} 40. Nf5+ gxf5 41. Qh5 Ng6 {Black is a piece and two pawns up and his king is pretty safe. Svidler played a very consistent game but it has to be agreed that Anish was completely off colour. He now faces the uphill task of winning with black in game two.} 0-1
