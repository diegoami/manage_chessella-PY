{White threatens to create a passed pawn on the queenside. Caruana makes
White's task easier by leaving the sixth rank with the rook.} 49... Rxg3 $2 50.
a5 $1 bxa5 51. c5 Kd8 $2 ({After} 51... Rg6 52. h5 Rf6 53. c6 Rd6 54. cxd7 (54.
c7 Bc8) 54... Rxd7 55. Rxa5 {Navara would have winning chances since the white
h-pawn still remains on the board.}) 52. h5 $1 {A wonderful quiet move, paving
the way for the king by not allowing a check on the sixth rank.} ({Caruana
hoped that he could survive giving up the bishop after} 52. c6 Bxc6 (52... Bc8
53. h5) 53. Bxc6 {and somehow exchange the last white pawn. Perhaps easier said
than done, but anyway Navara had a study-like finish in mind.}) 52... f4 53.
Kd6 Bc8 54. c6 Rg5 ({After} 54... Rd3 55. Rxg7 Rxd5+ 56. Kxd5 {the black king
is still in trouble.}) 55. Bf7 $1 {And that's how a true chess artist finishes
his game, mating with a pawn:} (55. Bf7 Bh3 56. Ra8+ Bc8 57. c7#) 1-0
