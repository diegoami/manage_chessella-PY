Kd2 $1 {(7:38) The exclam goes to Howell's draw offer. It was going to be a long suffering for White as Black could comfortably play h5-g6-e5-f5 and keep improving his position while all White could do was to stall. Howell, offered a draw before things got nastier. A wise decision on his part and not a very good one from his opponent's side, who showed more respect to his opponent than to his position.} (25.
