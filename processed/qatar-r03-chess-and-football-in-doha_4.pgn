Ba3 {Diagram [#] Up until this point Black has been doing not much, just trying
to inconvenience the white pieces by attacking them with Ba3 or Nb4. Mamedyarov
finally has enough and decides to sharpen the play by sacrificing an exchange.}
22. Bxc6 $5 {I should give this a dubious mark, but the refutation is not at
all easy to see and we should credit Mamedyarov's creativity.} Bxc1 (22... dxc6
$1 {What is happening here? Isnt the rook on c1 hanging and c5 threatened?} 23.
Nxc6 {was the idea prepared by Mamedyarov.} Rxd3 24. Nxa5 {and maybe at this
point Lenderman saw that he has to take on d1 and then after Rd1 he is badly
tangled up as the bishop on c8 cannot develop and Rd8+ is threatened. But here
he has a superb move which gives him a clear advantage. And maybe this is what
both the players missed.} Rd7 $3 {The c1 rook is still attacked, and if it
moves to b1 then Bb4 is extremely strong. On the other hand Rxd7 is met by Bxd7
and Black simply has the bishop pair and the knight on a5 is not at all well
placed.} 25. Rxd7 (25. Rb1 Bb4) 25... Bxd7 26. Rd1 Be8 $1 {and b6 is going to
trap the knight!}) 23. Be4 $1 Bb2 $6 (23... Ba3 24. Bxh7+ Kf8 $13 {White has to
prove his compensation here, but knowing the way Mamedyarov plays we can be
sure that he would have enjoyed handling this position as white.}) 24. Nxe6 $5
{A brilliant creative sacrifice. What exactly is happening? Just follow the
Shak!} fxe6 25. Bxh7+ Kh8 (25... Kf7 26. Ne4 {is also a strong attack with Ng5+
coming up.}) 26. Ne4 Rf8 (26... Qh5 27. Ng5 $18 {[%cal Gh7g6,Gg5f7]}) (26...
Bf6 {might have been the best. Let's try to make a few moves here.} 27. Nd6 $1
Rf8 28. Bg6 Kg8 29. Qe2 $18 {[%cal Gf4f5, Ge2h5] is most probably what
Mamedyarov was planning with f5 followed by Qh5. This looks like a crushing
attack.}) 27. Bg6 Kg8 28. Qe2 Bf6 29. c5 {Cutting the queen on a5 and getting
ready to play Qh5.} Bc3 30. Qh5 Rf5 31. Bxf5 (31. Qh7+ Kf8 32. Qh8+ Ke7 33.

who used his brilliant intuitive and imaginative powers to beat his American
opponent.} 1-0
