Nc3 {Once you have gone through the main line, you will see that the two knights against Caro-Kann is also sorted because you can play the same idea again.} d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 5. Nxf6+ exf6 {You can follow the main line in order to understand how Black should play in this position and pawn structure.}) 2... d5 3. Nc3 {The main line in the Caro-Kann.} dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 {This is an easy to learn opening system.} (4... Bf5 {Traditionally this has been the main line.}) 5. Nxf6+ exf6 {The idea is to go for quick development as now the bishop on f8 is open and you can castle quickly. One of the best things about this line is that Black's moves remain pretty much the same irrespective of how White responds.} 6. c3 (6. Nf3 {is a normal move but when the knight is on f3, White is usually trying to castle short, and this is somehow not the most critical.}) 6... Bd6 {The bishop always comes out on this active square.} 7. Bd3 O-O {Black always castles short.} 8. Qc2 {This is the main line putting pressure on the h7 point.} (8. Nf3 {This is the normal development for White.} Re8+ 9. Be3 Nd7 {The Black knight develops on d7 and moves to f8 defending the h7 pawn and can later come to g6.} 10. O-O Nf8 { Black has many possibilities in this position. The bishop on c8 can go to e6 or g4 completing the development.}) 8... Re8+ {The rook coming to e8 is not just a check, but you also put your rook on the only open file in the position. } 9. Ne2 h5 $1 {I like this move, because it kills two birds with one stone. Firstly the pawn on h7 was hanging, so you save it, but on the other hand the h-pawn can be used as a battering ram to soften White's position.} 10. O-O h4 $1 {The h-pawn doesn't stop!} 11. Bd2 h3 12. g3 Nd7 {As always the knight will move to f8 where it will defend the king and will be ready to jump to active play from g6 or e6. The bishop on c8 will go to e6 and g4 completing the development. Keep an eye out for the light squared weaknesses in White's position. Who knows, a black queen might land on f3 and it is game over!} *
