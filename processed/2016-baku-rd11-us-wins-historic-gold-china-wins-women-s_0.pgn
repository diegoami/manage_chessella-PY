In this crucial final round, we watched a North American derby between the US and the surprisingly strong Canadian team. With Kovalyov and Hansen scoring in every other game, the Canadians reached 4th place after the penultimate round. Being ahead just by a whisker in tie-break, a victory in this match was direly needed by the US squad. With the team's "big three" guns culminating victories one after other, we just had to sit and wait for one of them to score. This time, it was Caruana and So who delivered the victory. So's victory came in a topsy-turvy game.} 1. c4 { (00:00) Wesley So is not trying to get into an opening debate and he opts for an "English".} c5 {(00:56)} 2. Nf3 {(00:00)} Nc6 {(01:52)} 3.
