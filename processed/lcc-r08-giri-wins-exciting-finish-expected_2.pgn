        Qc2 Bb7 10. Bd2 Bd6 11. Ng5 $5 {The main idea of this move is to get in 
        e4.} (11. Re1 {is the main move here.}) 11... Bxg2 12. Kxg2 Nbd7 13. e4 
        e5 14. dxe5 Nxe5 15. f4 Nc4 {Until this point we have been following some 
        top level games, most notably Eljanov-Carlsen and Ponomariov-Karjakin. 
        Both games continued with 16.b3, but Caruana had a new idea up his sleeve.}

        16... h6 17. Nf3 Ng4 { [%cal Rg4e3,Ge3g2,Ge3f1,Ge3c2,Rc4e3] A huge fork 
        is threatened on e3.} 18. Re1 Bc5 19. Nc3 {Caruana was still very much 
        in his preparation. Now Anand could have won an exchange with Ne3+ but 
        decided against it.} Qd6 (19... Nge3+ 20. Bxe3 Nxe3+ 21. Rxe3 Bxe3 22. 
        Nd5 Bb6 23. Ne5 $44 {[%cal Ge5c6] The knights in the centre should not 
        be underestimated. White has sufficient compensation for the exchange. 
        What is very useful to learn from this example is that Caruana does not 
        always follow the best moves of the computer when preparing specific lines. 
        He goes for his own ideas, and the computer more often than not changes 
        its evaluation.}) 20. Nd1 Rad8 21. h3 Qxd1 22. Qxd1 Rxd1 23. Rxd1 Nge3+ 
        24. Bxe3 Nxe3+ 25. Kh2 Nxd1 26. Rxd1 {White has the slightly more pleasant 
        endgame, but nothing disastrous has occurred for Black. With accurate 
        play he can still hold.} Re8 27. e5 f6 28. Rd5 Bf8 29. Kg2 c5 30. Kf2 
        fxe5 31. Nxe5 {White's forces are centralised and the king is coming into 
        the game. Black has to be quick to get his counterplay rolling with the 
        queenside majority.} c4 32. Ke3 Bb4 33. Ke4 (33. Kd4 Be1 34. g4 Bg3 35.

        play Caruana is increasing the pressure on Vishy.} b4 37. h5 a5 $1 {Anand 
        knows that he cannot just sit around doing nothing. He tries his best 
        to create a passer, even at the cost of giving up a pawn.} 38. Rxa5 b3 
        39. Ra7 b2 40. Rb7 Ra8 41. Kd3 Bxe5 42. fxe5 Rxa2 43. Ke4 Ra1 {It is unclear 
        what commentary symbol this move should be given. It can be a dubious 
        mark as Black could have drawn even without giving up that pawn. But it 
        could also be an exclamation mark because Anand assessed the pawn down 
        endgame accurately.} (43... Kf8 44. Kf5 Ke8 45. Kg6 (45. e6 Ra5+ 46. Kg6
