{[#]} 34... Qd3 (34... Bd5 $5 {seems an easy enough way to reach an endgame
with the standard '3+1 v 3.' In practice, this is very often winning,
especially since White has no way to prevent Black getting behind the pawn,
apart from going right in front of it himself. In practice, I would do this
first and think about the ending later.} 35. Bxd5 Qxd5+ 36. Qxd5 Rxd5 37. Ra1
$1 a5 38. Kg2 Kf8 39. Kf3 Ke7 40. Ke4 Kd6 41. g5 $1 {White has to fix the
pawns this way, or else he will lose trivially to ...f5+ followed by a king
walk. As it is, his position is extremely close to being indefensible following
} Rf5 $1 $17) (34... Qd2 $1 {is the high-depth Stockfish recommendation. The
plan is, in vague terms: support ...a5-a4, then return the queen to f8, from
where it can co-ordinate operations easily and threaten ...Qg7 at useful
moments.}) 35. Kg2 Qd2+ 36. Kg3 {White tries for practical chances based on
king walks up the chain of dark squares.} a5 37. Rg2 Qb4 $1 {Black has begun
the plan alluded to earlier.} 38. h4 $6 (38. Re2 {is objectively better,
followed by Qe7 at some moment and trying to save an endgame, but this is hard
to play.}) 38... a4 39. h5 Qd6 (39... a3 $1 {was consistent, not getting
unncessarily worried by} 40. h6 (40. hxg6 fxg6 {is also solid}) 40... Qf8 $1
41. Qc3 a2 $19 {when White has a mate motif set up but Black's pawn is only a
single square from promotion and ...Rd3 overloading ideas are constantly in
the pipeline.}) 40. Qa5 Qd3 $2 {Giving White genuine practical chances.} (40...
h6 $1 41. hxg6 fxg6 {is basically winning, because White doesn't have a
constructive way to avoid ...g5. There is a little bit of mess but not more.
For instance,} 42. Kh3 a3 43. f5 Bc4 $1 $17) 41. h6 $1 Bd1 $2 {A variety of
moves were okay, starting with ...Qd4 or ...Qd6, or even ...f6.} 42. Qe5 $1 $11
{White is tactically alert. The best Black can do now is admit to the
perpetual check.} Qd4 $4 {This would bring the position back to close to
winning, if not for a very cute motif.} (42... Qxf3+ 43. Kh4 Kf8 44. Qh8+ Ke7
45. Qe5+ Kd7 46. Qb5+ $1 $11) 43. Rd2 $3 {A very nice, if basic, tactic. Black
played one more move with an utterly despondent air, and then left the room,
the better to drink (with the author of these lines) and forget about this
painful game.} Qg1+ 44. Kh4 1-0
