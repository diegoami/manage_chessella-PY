Nh4 { (195s)} Qc3 {(55s) White has been struggling with a worse position against the former World Champion for most of the game, and now the black queen is attacking both the pawn on e5 and the rook on e1. Is it game over?} 30. Rexe4 $1 {(32s) Not quite! This is not a sacrifice of desperation but a bona fide brilliancy that saves the game.} dxe4 {(50s)} 31. Rxf7 $1 {(1s)} Rxf7 {(77s)} 32.

Everything else loses for White.} Qf1+ {(33s)} 42. Kh2 {(1s)} Qf4+ {(17s)} 43. Kh1 {(0s)} Qf1+ {(14s)} 44. Kh2 {(1s)} Qf4+ {(7s) Kramnik smiled, obviously in respect and admiration for the superb last-minute save, and extended his hand. Draw!} 1/2-1/2
