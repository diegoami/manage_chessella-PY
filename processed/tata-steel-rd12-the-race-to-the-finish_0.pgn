$2 { (517s) The chess expression "long think, wrong think" seems to apply here.
There was no need to sacrifice the pawn, and c5 could have been better prepared
to achieve full equality. White's rooks are already in place, so why unleash
them without a rook reception committee of Black's own?} (17... Ba6 { to
protect b5 and prepare ...c5 was better.} 18. Bf1 {pressuring b5 once more.}
