...c6 is the more popular way to play but Carlsen had a concrete idea in mind.}
8. Qc2 Ne4 $5 {Not exactly a new idea because we will see the position that
was reached in the game after a few moves was played by some good players from
black side.} 9. Bf4 c6 (9... g5 {directly doesn't work due to} 10. cxd5 $1 $14)
10. Nc3 (10. Nbd2 g5 11. Be3 f5 {could have been another idea on Carlsen's
mind.}) 10... g5 $1 {Carlsen knows his Classics. This was played by Botvinnik
against Petrosian in their ninth game of the 1963 match!} 11. Be3 $6 (11. Bc1 {
would have been better and after} f5 12. b3 Bf6 13. Bb2 $14 {The game is
complex, with White retaining slighly preferable chances.}) 11... Nd6 $1 {
Now this causes Eljanov some fresh problems to deal with. Firstly the pawn on
c4 is hanging and secondly the knight is coming to f5.} 12. b3 (12. cxd5 $5
exd5 {Would give Black equal chances as his bishop on c8 is liberated.
Although one must agree that the pawn sticking out on g5 surely looks weird.})
12... Nf5 {Now the bishop on e3 cannot move as g5-g4 will lose the d4 pawn.} (

{This is a move of a true genius! How can Carlsen come up with a move like
this? The main idea is to create some queenside play by sacrificing a pawn.
But this isn't as random as one might think it is. First of all you need to
develop your bishop on c8. But where can it go? The pawn on e6 is not going to
move in the days to come. So you would think about moving your b-pawn. ...b6
is a natural move but then Magnus must have got the idea - why not move it two
squares?!} 15. e4 (15. cxb5 cxb5 16. Nxb5 Qb6 17. Nc3 Ba6 {With a rook coming
to c8 Black seems to have excellent compensation.}) 15... b4 (15... bxc4 16.
bxc4 dxc4 $15 {Also looks strong with moves like Nb6 and c5 coming up.}) 16.
exd5 {In many ways this game reminds us of the battle between Eljanov-Nakamura
from the World Cup where the Ukrainian made a material sacrifice to get some
important queenside pawns.} bxc3 17. dxc6 Nb8 $1 18. Qe4 {Of course the pawn
on c6 coupled with the bishop on g2 does look threatening but Black has
concrete ways to deal with this.} f5 $1 19. gxf5 exf5 20. Qd5+ Qxd5 21. cxd5
Na6 $1 {Carlsen's play is highly accurate. Next he would like to blockade the
pawns on the dark squares.} 22. Rac1 Nc7 23. Ne5 f4 $5 {Preventing e3 so that
the d4 pawn can be attacked.} (23... Rd8 {is not such a great idea because of}
24. Rxc3 $1 (24. e4 $6 fxe4 25. Bxe4 Rxd5 $1 (25... Nxd5 $2 26. Rf7 $36) 26.
Bxd5+ Nxd5 $17) 24... Nxd5 $2 25. c7 Rd6 26. Rc5 Be6 27. Nc4 $18) (23... Nb5
24. e3 {keeps control to some extent.}) 24. Nc4 $6 (24. Rxc3 {seemed obvious
and now Magnus has many ways to continue.} Nb5 25. Rd3 Kg7 $15 {Black should
be slightly better for sure as the pawns are not going anywhere.}) 24... Rd8 $1
25. Rxc3 Nxd5 26. c7 Nxc7 27. Bxa8 Nxa8 {White has won back some material but
now the bishops wreck havoc on the board.} 28. e3 Bb4 29. Rc2 Bb7 $1 (29...

exf4 Rxd4 31. fxg5 Rg4+ $19) 30... Be4 $1 31. Rh2 Nb6 $1 {What clarity of
thinking. Bringing back all the pieces and not really caring about the tension
on the kingside.} (31... fxe3 32. Nxe3 $17) 32. Ne5 (32. hxg5 Nxc4 33. bxc4

Rxd4 34. Ng4 Nd5 {With moves like Rd2 coming up and no real mating threats on
the kingside, Eljanov saw no real reason to continue the game. A very accurate
game by the World Champion and particularly impressive was his move 14...b5!!}
