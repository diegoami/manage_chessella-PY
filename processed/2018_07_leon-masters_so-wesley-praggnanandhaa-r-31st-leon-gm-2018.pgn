{It was for the first time that Praggnanandhaa was facing a world class GM in
a serious rapid game. Pragg had just become a GM 15 days ago at the age of 12
years 10 months and 13 days. So the pressure of achieving that title was off
his shoulders. But at the same time I think this was another pressure
situation because people wanted to know how would he fare against one of the
best rapid players in the business. That being said, even Wesley So would have
faced the pressure because he was up against such a young boy, who was not
even a teenager. Full credit to organizers in Leon for organizing this
exciting four game rapid match with a time control of 20 minutes + 10 seconds
increment per move.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 {Wesley just wants to play something
original and not check Pragg's opening preparation.} d5 3. Bf4 {Baadur Jobava
can be attributed in popularizing this opening, but now it has been used by
just about every top player in elite chess.} Bf5 4. Nb5 {With this move White
frees his c-pawn to advance to c4 at an appropriate moment.} Na6 5. e3 e6 (5...
c6 6. Nc3 {is also possible, and now Black has to decide whether he wants to
allow the doubling on his pawns on a6 or just wants to move his knight to c7.})
6. c4 Be7 ({In the third rapid game of the match, Pragg improved with ...c6.} 
6... c6 7. Nc3 Nb4 8. Rc1 Qa5 {Wesley So - Praggnanandhaa, game 3, Leon Match
2018.}) 7. a3 O-O 8. c5 {This seemed like an ambitious move by Wesley, but he
is asking Pragg that if you think this is overextending and I am neglecting my
development, then try to punish! It's true, there is no easy way for Black to
punish White for the liberties he has taken.} Ne8 {This was a tad too passive.}

this looks a bit too slow.} 11. g4 $1 {I must say that this was an ambitious
choice by Wesley.} (11. Nf3 Nd7 12. Be2 $14 {And I felt that White had a risk
free edge because ...e5 for Black is not so easy to engineer and meanwhile
White has good control on the position.}) 11... Bg6 12. Nf3 {Now h4 followed
by h5 was a big threat.} Nf6 {Not seeing any real way to fight against h4-h5,
Pragg gets his knight back on f6.} (12... h5 13. Ne5 $18) 13. Ne5 {Wesley is

plan is now simple. Either to play h4-h5 and start an attack. Or just play f4
and clamp down on the e5 square.} g5 {Pragg stops both f4 and h4 with this
move.} 16. Bd3 (16. f4 {Trying to clamp the e5 square would not be so great as
after} gxf4 17. exf4 g5 $1 {Black gets some good counterplay.}) 16... Bf6 {
Black is all set to play e5 and it seems as if White has no good way to stop
it. But Wesley is not really interested in stopping the move ...e5. He goes
for an aggressive idea.} 17. h4 $5 (17. Qb3 Kh8 (17... e5 18. Nxd5 $18) 18. Rd1

Wesley is alert and spots his chance.} (19. Bxf8 Qxf8 $44 {seems like decent
compensation.}) 19... Bxg5 20. Qh5 $2 {With this move So gives up all his

little boy surprised him with a nice intermezzo.} g6 $5 (23... Nxf8 24. Qf7

started to feel that the game might end in a draw. The main reason being that
materially Black is doing really well. On the other hand White's coordination
is good so he might be able to recover a pawn or two until Black fully
develops.} 27. Ke2 g5 28. Rab1 a6 29. d5 cxd5 30. Bxd5 Nc6 31. Rhd1 Rb8 $6 (

much more original and active!} Nc7 18. Bf4 Ne5 {Now e6 is falling. It seems
