1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Bb4 {We have to start calling this Anand's special.} 3. Nd5 a5
(3... Bc5 {has been Anand's main choice, and he did play it against Nepo in
Riyadh and had lost. So, it was time for a change.}) 4. Nf3 d6 5. a3 Bc5 6. e3
c6 7. d4 Ba7 8. Nc3 Nd7 9. Ne4 Bb8 $5 {The bishop has made four moves and
finds itself on a very interesting square!} 10. d5 Ngf6 $1 11. dxc6 Nxe4 12.
cxd7+ Bxd7 {This net exchange has led to a very nice edge for Black. He would
like to play a4, put his knight on c5 and look at all the queenside weaknesses.
So Nepo's next move is sort of forced.} 13. b3 Bc6 14. Bb2 Qb6 15. Qc2 Nc5 16.
Nd2 O-O $15 {The main problem for White is that he cannot develop his f1
bishop without losing the g2 pawn and f3 is not really possible.} 17. Be2 Bxg2
$1 {The pawn had to be taken!} 18. Rg1 Bc6 19. O-O-O {Although this seems
clearly better for Black, White has a plan. Double the rooks on g-file and
sacrifice something. Black has to play carefully.} Qd8 20. Rg3 Qh4 21. Rdg1 g6
{The queen stands very well on h4.} 22. f4 Qxh2 $1 {The h2 pawn is taken and
White is in trouble. The bishop on c6 does a wonderful job of stopping all the
moves on f3 and g2 squares.} 23. Kd1 Bc7 24. Nf3 Bxf3 (24... Qh6 {keeping the
bishop on c6 would have been better, but when you are ahead on material, you
just want to exchange pieces.}) 25. Bxf3 Qxc2+ 26. Kxc2 {This is a better
position for Black as he is two pawns up But he has to be careful as White has
the bishop pair and also the active pieces.} Rab8 27. Rh3 Kg7 28. Rgh1 Rh8 (
28... h5 {There wasn't anything particularly wrong with this move. But Anand
plays it ultra safe.}) 29. b4 Nd7 (29... Na4 30. Ba1 axb4 31. axb4 Nb6 32. Kb3
$15) 30. Rd1 Rhd8 31. Kb3 h5 32. Rd5 b6 33. Ka4 Nf6 34. Rd2 Ng4 {Slowly and
steadily Anand unravels.} 35. Bc6 Kh6 36. Kb5 f5 37. Bc3 Rf8 38. Bf3 Rbe8 39.
Rg2 Bd8 (39... d5 $1 {would have been a powerful blow to end the game.} 40.
cxd5 exf4 41. exf4 Bxf4 42. Bxg4 fxg4 43. Rxg4 Rd8 $19) 40. Kc6 {The king is
really active and Black is under quite some pressure.} Bf6 41. Bxg4 fxg4 42.
Rxg4 exf4 43. Bxf6 Rxf6 44. Rxf4 Rxf4 (44... Rfe6 $17) 45. exf4 axb4 46. axb4
Re4 {Anand made this move confidently and it seems as if he is still in
control, but he isn't.} 47. Rc3 Rxf4 48. Kxb6 $2 (48. Kxd6 $1 {was the correct
move. But when you have little time you want to take the pawn that is further
away. In principle the b-pawn pushing down the board looks much better. But
when you have a race ever tempo is important and here the route for the c-pawn
is completely open, while in the game when the pawn on b6 was taken c5 was no
longer good because Rxb4 would come with a check.} g5 49. c5 bxc5 (49... Rxb4
50. c6 Rd4+ 51. Ke5 Rd8 52. c7 Rc8 53. Kd6 h4 54. Kd7 Rxc7+ 55. Rxc7 $1 {
The rook must come from behind.} g4 56. Ke6 g3 57. Kf5 g2 58. Rc1 h3 59. Kf6 h2
60. Rc8 {with a study like draw.} Kh5 61. Kf5 Kh4 62. Kf4 Kh5 63. Kf5 $11) 50.

Black pawns are just too fast.} 52. b7 Rf8 53. Kxd6 h2 54. Rc1 g3 55. Rh1 Kg5
