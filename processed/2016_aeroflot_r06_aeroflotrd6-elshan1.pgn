1. d4 d6 {Axel likes this first move.} 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 {A
transposition to KID.} 5. g3 {Korobov has a very broad repertoire and this
move is within his repertoire. Nevertheless, this choice explains Korobov's
psychological state of mind for today's battle: He is planning for a safe
long-lasting edge from the white side of the King's Indian.} O-O 6. Bg2 Nbd7 {
[#] Bronstein's favorite. Nc6 followed by a6 and Rb8 is another popular plan
in this position thanks to the efforts of legendary Efim Geller in the 50s and
60s.} (6... Nc6 7. O-O a6 8. Qd3 e5 {was played by none other than Korobov
himself!} 9. d5 Nb4 10. Qd1 a5 11. h3 Bf5 12. Nh4 Bd7 {1-0 (50) Kovalenko,I 
(2700)-Korobov,A (2700) Berlin 2015}) 7. O-O e5 8. e4 exd4 9. Nxd4 Re8 10. h3
Nc5 {Nothing is new yet! All have been played several times. The author of
this "commentary" has played it on several occasions from White's side!} 11.
Re1 a5 {[%cal Ga5b4] A thematic move. Otherwise, White would kick the c5
knight with b4 once he secures "matters" on the a1-h8 diagonal.} 12. Qc2 c6 (

Bg5 Qc7 23. Rd1 Ra6 24. b3 {and the d6 pawn will collapse and so does black's
position.}) 13. Be3 Qc7 14. Rad1 Be6 $5 {Black offers his bishop for White's
central knight. Although Nxe6 is a playable move, due to Black's lack of space,
it is more practical to keep more pieces on the board.} 15. b3 Rad8 16. f4 {
The most popular and most principled.} Bc8 17. Bf2 h5 $6 $146 {[%cal Gh5h4,
Yh4g3] When I first saw this move, I immediately thought about GM Sarhan
Guliev, who trained me from when I was only 2250 until I became a GM. If I had
played this move, Sarhan would have called me a "Cafe player". It is hard to
believe that this h pawn move could ever lead to anything tangible for Black
since White has already established his center. However, as the game proceeds.
Bachmann's idea is to re-route his knight thorugh h7 instead of d7.} (17...

is not interested in Nfd7.} 19. Bd4 Bxd4+ 20. Rxd4 Nf8 21. Kh2 $6 {A waste of
time.} (21. Rdd1 {had great prophylactic value since it would have prevented
Black from bringing his queen to the kingside.} Nfe6 (21... Qe7 22. a3 {

prevented g5.}) 24... g5 $1 {Black has managed to neutralize White's advantage.
What happens next has a lot of aesthetic and dramatic value!} 25. f5 Nf8 26.

Korobov's misses Black's tactical response.} (28. gxh4 {would have given White
some solid advantage.} Ne5 29. Nxe5 dxe5 (29... Qxe5+ $4 {loses to} 30. Rg3+

33. Na4 Nxe4 $1 {A beautiful position. All of Black's pieces are cooperating
in the attack against White's king, and yet, the computer shows that after Ne1,
White holds. My suggestion? Turn off your engines and watch how Bachmann's
piece harmony takes Korobov's king to its final journey!} 34. Kxh4 $4 (34. Ne1
