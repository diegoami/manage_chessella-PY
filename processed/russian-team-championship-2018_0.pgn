1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nc6 5. Qd2 {Well, Fedoseev was in Shamkir
and he saw Carlsen playing this line.} Nf6 6. b3 e5 $6 {No matter how much you
love your Sicilian Najdorf and how badly you want to stick to familiar
patterns, this move, now coming without hitting that knight on d4, looks
suspect to me.} ({I still prefer} 6... e6 {as played by Wojtaszek in that stem
game. I think I know where Rado went wrong later on.}) 7. Bb2 Be7 { [#]} 8. g3
$5 {The fianchettoed bishops will deter Black from the d6-d5 pawn break in the
center. Other than that it is slow and unconvincing.} ({My vote would go for
the generally healthy English Attack setup with} 8. O-O-O O-O 9. f3 {That's
what Magnus would have done, isn't it?}) 8... O-O 9. Bg2 Nd4 $5 { Getting rid
of Nc6 is a good idea. Black needs to develop some play on the c-file, the
sooner the better,} 10. Nge2 Nxe2 ({First I thought Evgeniy's idea was the
fancy tactic} 10... Bh3 {but does Black really want to trade light-squared
bishops in this situation? Not with that gaping hole on d5, I don't think.})

18. h3 Bd7 19. Kh2 h5 20. f4 $5 {I love Vladimir's ultra-ambitious chess, but
he's still learning to control it.} (20. Nd5 Nxd5 21. exd5 Qc7 22. c4 $14)
20... b5 21. Nd5 Nxd5 22. exd5 Qc7 {[#]} 23. Qe2 $2 { Was this move necessary
or even useful to any degree?} ({The direct} 23. c4 bxc4 24. bxc4 {seemed
logical enough. The threat of c4-c5 is quite serious and may prompt Black to
defend with the ugly f7-f6 move.}) 23... h4 $1 24. gxh4 Re8 {Now Najer gets
counterplay best measured in tons.} 25. Qf2 Qd8 26. Be4 f5 27. Bf3 Bxh4 28. Qg2
{[#]} g5 $5 {In the immortal words of the late GM Igor Ivanov, we Russians
never go back!} 29. fxe5 dxe5 30. Bh5 Re7 31. c4 Rh7 32. Be2 f4 $2 {Missing a
big shot.} ({First the g-pawn,} 32... g4 $1 {then the rest will play itself:}

34. cxb5 {[#]} Bg3+ ({Instead,} 34... Bf2 $1 {would weave a mating net, even in
case of a queen trade, as in} 35. Rxc8+ Bxc8 36. Qxe5 Qxe5 37. Bxe5 Bxh3 38.
Bd3 Rh4) 35. Kg1 Bxh3 $2 {Some inaccuracies in what I presume, was heavy time
trouble, still wouldn't have cost Evgeniy the game had he captured the pawn
wirth the right piece.} (35... Rxh3 $1 36. Bxe5 Bh2+ $1 ( 36... Re8 37. Bxf6

unable to deliver another blow.} f3 (39... Rf8 40. Rc6) 40. Rxc8+ Bxc8 41. Qe8+
