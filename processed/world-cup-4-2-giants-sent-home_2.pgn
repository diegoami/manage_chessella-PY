However, here he underestimates Black's activity.} 22. Bxd5 (22. a4 $1 $14 {Would have seen the American press for a while.}) 22...

I have a hunch that this move should be looked at more closely, as I believe it is a mistake to lock the structure like this. Karsten Muller will definitely take a look at this endgame for ChessBase Magazine with the truth of the position.} (42. Ra6 $1 Rc7 (42... Nxf2 $1 43. Ra7+ Kf6 44. Ra6+ Ke5 45. Rxg6 Ne4+ 46.
