In this topsy-turvy match, Katerina Nemcova first put the US team in the lead only to see Valentina Gunina equalize by beating Nazi Paikidze. With Zatonskih and Pogonina ending in a draw, it all came down to the mighty first board clash on board one, where ex-world champion GM Alexandra Kosteniuk faced multiple US women's champion GM Irina Krush.} 1. e4 {(0s)} c5 {(0s)} 2. Nf3 {(0s)} e6 {(2s)} 3. d4 { (0s)} cxd4 {(6s)} 4. Nxd4 {(0s)} a6 {(16s) Krush plays the "Kan-Paulsen" system, whose disappearance from top-level competition might lead one to think it is considered "risky'. Nevertheless, in such a crucial match, only those who have the guts and eagerness to take such risks can hope for victory.} 5. Bd3 { (24s)} Nf6 {(35s)} 6. O-O {(88s)} Qc7 {(30s)} 7. Qe2 {(268s)} d6 {(28s)} 8. a4 {(93s)} (8. c4 {is the mainline.}) 8... b6 {(439s) otherwise a5 would have fixed Black's queenside.} 9. f4 {(249s) Already an uncommon way of handling this opening.} Nbd7 {(176s)} 10. b4 $5 $146 {(503s) An interesting novelty by Kosteniuk. The bishop will go to b2 while the c5 square is taken away from Black. A very creative idea by Kosteniuk.} d5 $2 {(1357s) Krush's reaction is very human but rather overly optimistic. She gives away more space when her king is still in the center.} (10... e5 11. Nf5 Bb7 {was probably a better choice and what Kosteniuk had probably prepared for.}) 11. e5 {(284s)} Ne4 { (18s) White cannot win a pawn on e4 because her pawn on b4 is en prise. Nevertheless, I assure you that White does not want that pawn at the cost of her light squared bishop which would give Black a lot of compensation along the a8-h1 diagonal and c and d files.} 12. Ba3 {( 564s)} a5 {(413s)} (12... Bb7 13. c4 {looks close to lost for Black. Irina Krush is in deep trouble.}) 13. Nb5 { (412s)} Qc6 {(193s)} 14. bxa5 {(191s)} Bc5+ {(1092s)} (14... Bxa3 15. N1xa3 O-O 16. c4 Ndc5 {Looks bad but playable for Black.}) 15. Bxc5 {(54s)} Ndxc5 $6 { (23s) Irina misses a nasty tactic.} 16. Na7 $1 {(607s) Kosteniuk has played superbly so far. The knight on a7 is 'untouchable'} Qc7 {(99s)} (16... Rxa7 $4 17. Bb5 {and the pin costs Black a queen.}) 17. axb6 {(77s)} Qxb6 {(30s)} 18. Nxc8 {(8s)} Rxc8 {(70 s)} 19. Bb5+ {(37s)} Nd7+ {(363s)} 20. Kh1 {(5s)} Qa7 { (19s)} 21. Bd3 {(481s)} Ndc5 {(541s)} (21... O-O 22. Bxe4 dxe4 23. Qxe4 Nb6 24. Nd2 Rfd8 25. Rfd1 Qa5 {surprisingly gives Black good chances to fight for a draw.}) 22. Qe3 {(138s)} Rc7 $6 {(51s) This again loses a tempo.} (22... Ra8 {was necessary and Black should hope to hold a middlgame a pawn down.}) 23. Na3 { (223s)} Qa5 {(395s)} 24. Nb5 {(218s)} Rc8 {(8s)} 25. Nd4 $6 {(132s) This lets go off some of White's advantage.} (25. Bxe4 Nxe4 26. Qa3 {followed by f5 looks very nasty.}) 25... O-O {(36s)} 26. Bb5 {(167s)} Ra8 {(81s)} 27. Rf3 $6 { (269s) An inappropriate square for the rook.} (27. Rfe1 {with the idea of c4 or f5 to undermine Black's strong centralized knights.}) 27... Qb4 {(261s)} 28. Bc6 {(597s)} Ra6 $6 {(145s)} (28... Rac8 29. f5 Qb8 {was probably better.}) 29. f5 {(27s)} Rc8 {(296s)} 30. Bb5 {(40s)} Raa8 {(15s)} 31. c3 $6 {(244s)} (31. Rd1 {is a strong prophylactic move which prevents Black's attempt to exchange queens.}) 31... Qb2 {(21s)} 32. Raf1 $6 {(24 s)} (32. Rd1 {This is still better.} Nxa4 $2 33. fxe6 fxe6 34. Bd7 {with a winning attack.}) 32... Qd2 {(55s) } 33. fxe6 {(62s)} fxe6 {(2s)} 34. Nc6 $6 {(217s)} Rc7 {(53s)} 35. Qd4 { (58s) Most of White's advantage has fizzled out.} h6 $1 {(20s) A necessary vent for Black's king when neither side has much to improve.} 36. Qb4 {(36s)} Qg5 {(51s) Ok, but a bit counter-intuitive.} (36... Rb7 {forces} 37. a5 { and now} Kh7 $1 {with a difficult position for... White!} 38. Nd4 {for instance runs into} Qa2) 37. g3 {(71s)} Qd2 {(31s)} 38. Nd4 {(32s)} Qg5 {(28s)} 39. Nc6 {(15s)} Qd2 {(16s)} 40. Nd4 {(0s)} Qg5 {(0s)} 41.

With all these open files in this position, Black's rooks would 'rule' the board and White's extra pawns for the exchange are 'weak' compensation. Nevertheless, White should be able to hold with accurate play.} 46. Bxd5+ {(30s)} Kh7 {(143s)} 47. Rf4 $2 {(398s) I do not understand this move. White needed some active play with e6.} (47. e6 $1 Nxa4 48. Re3 Nb6 49. Bc6 Nc4 50. Re1 Rxc6 51. Nxc6 Rxc6 52. e7 Nd6 53. e8=Q Nxe8 54. Rxe8 $11) 47... Rd7 {(284s)} 48.

Kosteniuk won the first half of the match but Krush won the second half and unfortunately for Kosteniuk, Irina Krush only made the 'penultimate' mistake in this game!} (67... h5 68. Kxh5 Nf4+) 0-1
