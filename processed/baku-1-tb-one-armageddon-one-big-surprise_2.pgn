Nce2 {After winning the first game, Hou Yifan has to hold on the second to advance. However, her next move is risky to say the very least.} f6 19. e6 Nb6 20. Bf5 $1 {Leitao's hold in the position is very real. Qc2 is a huge threat. The commentators thought Yifan was done for, but never count out anyone in this tournament!} g6 {A practical chance...} 21. Nxg6 $6 (21. Bxg6 $1 hxg6 22. Nxg6 Kg7 23. Nef4 $1 $16 {and it's hard to find moves for Black, even though there isn't anything immediate. A possible follow up is Qe3 and Bd2, with strong threats.}) 21... hxg6 22. Qh6 gxf5 23. Qg6+ {A double piece sacrifice, but Leitao needs to win.

Black only needs a draw so she allows several perpetuals, though with careful play Black might even be winning.} 31. Rf1 Qe8 32. Qh6 Rf6 33. Rxg4+ fxg4 34. Rxf6 Bxf6 35. Qxf6 Qxe2 36. Qg6+ Kh8 37.
