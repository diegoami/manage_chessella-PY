1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. Bf4 {Today, it seems like the London System is a better
winning weapon than the Catalan or, God forbid, allowing the Nimzo.} Bf5 4. e3
e6 5. c4 Bxb1 {This line is, of course, very well known to Wesley So, as the
following notes will make clear.} 6. Qxb1 Bb4+ 7. Kd1 Bd6 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bxf6 (9.
Bh4 {was played in an online game between the same players. Following} Nbd7 10.
cxd5 exd5 11. Bd3 c6 12. Ke2 Be7 13. b4 a6 14. Rc1 O-O 15. a4 {White had a
reasonable minority-attack position, and the early movements of his king have
not been particularly to his detriment.} Ne4 16. Bxe4 Bxh4 17. Bh7+ Kh8 18. Bf5
Nb6 19. b5 cxb5 20. axb5 a5 21. g3 Be7 22. Kf1 $132 {Carlsen,M-So,W chess.com
INT 2017}) 9... Qxf6 10. cxd5 {An interesting sequence of forcing moves, which
even the cloud engines don't immediately get.} (10. c5 {was chosen by Wesley
from the White side. Following} Bf8 11. Qc2 c6 12. b4 a6 13. Bd3 Nd7 14. Ke2 g5
(14... e5 $132 {was probably also playable}) 15. h3 Bg7 16. a4 {White was
probably marginally for choice in So,W -Wojtaszek,R Shamkir 2017}) 10... exd5
11. e4 Be7 12. Bb5+ c6 13. e5 $1 {White needs to close the centre, at least
for the next 10 moves until his king finds a home or the queens come off.} Qf4
14. Bd3 c5 15. dxc5 Nc6 (15... Nd7 16. Bb5 $5 {might have been the intention,
and after} O-O-O 17. Bxd7+ Rxd7 18. b4 $44 {there follows an interesting fight
for compensation- White is a few moves away from consolidation. I suspect this
is the next direction for Black to look in for answers to the deep theoretical
question Magnus asks in this game.}) 16. Qc1 {Presumably still in preparation,
Magnus is playing the most incisive continuations.} Qb4 17. a3 Qxc5 18. Ke2
Nd4+ 19. Nxd4 Qxd4 20. f4 {At a guess, I would say Magnus had seen this
position in his preparation, and noted the idea of e6 against ...f6, and left
it at that.} O-O 21. Qd2 Qb6 22. Rhe1 f6 (22... Rac8 23. Kf3 $14 {is
unexpectedly difficult for Black to play given the opening. This is chiefly
due to his isolated pawn.}) 23. e6 (23. exf6 Bxf6 24. Kf3 {is not completely
without venom too.}) 23... Qxe6+ 24. Kf3 Qd7 25. Rad1 (25. g4 $14 {is another
natural idea White could use.}) 25... Rad8 (25... f5 $11 {is a rather solid
move, giving back the isolated pawn in an uncomplicated way, and setting up
with ...Bf6 and ...g6.}) 26. Qe3 Bd6 27. Bg6 $14 f5 {A bit late. Now Black
ends up giving more pawns than intended.} (27... Kh8 28. Rxd5 f5 29. Qd3 {
is similarly bad, but with queens on, so maybe Black can play more easily.})
28. Qe6+ Qxe6 29. Rxe6 Bc5 (29... Bc7 30. h4 $16 {is deeply unpleasant since
Black lacks moves of any sort that don't lose material, but maybe this
followed by} Rf6 31. Rxf6 gxf6 32. Bxf5 Kf7 {was the way to go}) 30. Re5 Rf6
31. Bxf5 Bd6 32. Rdxd5 $1 (32. Rexd5 g6 $11) 32... Kf7 33. Re4 g6 34. Bg4 h5
35. Bh3 $16 {White has consolidated his extra pawn.} Re8 36. Red4 {Allowing a
motif that hits the bishop on h3.} (36. Rxe8 Kxe8 37. g3 {was worth
considering, and the bishop can hit one of b7 and g6 next. This position is
also technically winning.}) 36... Be5 37. Rb4 g5 {Black is trying his best!}
38. g3 b6 (38... g4+ 39. Bxg4 hxg4+ 40. Kxg4 $16 {will also be deeply
unpleasant with White taking on b7 next, but I'd have taken the extra piece
anyway.}) 39. Rd7+ $6 {Objectively not a great move, but in practical terms
the pawns will be hard to handle.} ({It was not necessary to offer the piece
again, for instance} 39. Bf1 {kept great winning chances}) 39... Kf8 40. Rh7
g4+ 41. Bxg4 hxg4+ 42. Kxg4 Bd6 43. Rc4 a5 44. Rc6 Kg8 (44... Be7 $1 $11 {
was the most precise defence, though I suspect Black didn't see salvation in
the rookless position after} 45. Rh8+ Kf7 46. Rxf6+ Bxf6 47. Rxe8 Kxe8 48. b3 {
. Nevertheless, another 15 computer moves should see him save this.}) 45. Rb7
Be5 46. Rcxb6 Rxb6 47. Rxb6 Bd4 48. Rb5 {Now once more White has four pawns
for the piece. Due to the reduced material and practical difficulties it is
hard to offer any advice other than to cheat...} Re2 49. b3 Rxh2 (49... a4 50.
bxa4 Rxh2 {would at least have compromised White's structure- and I suspect
the a3-pawn will be dropping soon.}) 50. Rxa5 Re2 51. Rd5 Bb2 52. a4 {And just
like that, the position is technically winning. At no point does it slip away.}

Rd4 Rb2+ 71. Ka4 Kf5 72. Rb4 Ra2+ 73. Kb5 Bxf4 74. Rxf4+ Kxf4 75. b7 {A very
strong creative effort by White, although it might just have appeared like
technique on the surface.} 1-0
