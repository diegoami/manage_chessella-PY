1. d4 {0 Ding Liren's first move comes as no surprise.} Nf6  2. c4  e6  3. g3
{0 The question is why he continues with g3. Is he afraid of Levon Aronian's
Queen's Indian? It's true Levon used to play it quite a bit until 2008, but
since then he hasn't really tried it out.} d5  4. Bg2  Be7  5. Nf3  O-O  6. O-O
{10 No b3 ideas this time around. Ding Liren sticks to the normal Catalan.}

for this move. But these days it is all about 8.a4.}) 8... Bd7  9. Qxc4  Bc6 
10. Bg5 {28 Ding Liren sticks to the move that gave him success against Wang
Hao. But Aronian's experience in this line is immense. He has played 20 games
in this position - 15 with white and 5 with black.} a5  11. Nc3  Na6  12. e3
{533 This is relatively rare. In fact only 13 games have been played with this
move. Ding Liren took nine minutes to play this. After the game he said that he
wanted to play Rfd1 but was afraid of Bd5. With e3 he makes a square for his
queen on e2.} (12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. e4 {is the main line.}) (12. Rfd1 Bd5 {This is
the move that Ding was afraid of} 13. Nxd5 exd5 14. Qb5 Nb4 $11) (12. Rac1 {is
also possible.}) 12... Nb4  13. Rfd1  Nd7 $146 { 355 Although Levon took six
minutes to make his move, it's quite possible that he had prepared it. Earlier
black players would go for the move h6 and then White would take on f6. Levon
feels that his knight is much more important than the bishop. And hence, plays
Nd7.} (13... h6 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. Rac1 Bxf3 16. Bxf3 c6 {is a normal position
where White usually has a small edge.}) 14. Bxe7  Qxe7  15. e4  Rfd8  16. Rd2
$6 {434 Later Ding began to regret this move. Not only does he lose
co-ordination between his rooks, the piece is not ideally placed on d2.} (16.
Qe2 $5 Nb6 17. b3 Be8 18. Rac1 c5 19. Qe3 {is a much superior version to what
happened in the game.}) 16... Nb6  17. Qe2  Be8 $1 {159 If it were not for this
move, White would be clearly better. Black retreats his bishop and prepares the
move c5.} 18. b3  c5 $1 {145 Levon had prepared the opening well and now breaks
the centre with c5. White has to be careful, not to land into a worse
position.} 19. Qe3  Rac8 $5 {236 Black is all ready to play ...c4. His idea is
to meet..c4 d5 with Qc5!} (19... c4 { was possible, but Ding had prepared} 20.

if the players were ready to call it a day. Handshakes were expected, but Ding
Liren's next move gives his opponent a glimmer of hope to get a small
advantage.} 30. Ncb3 $6  (30. f3 $11 {should give White a fine position.})
30... b6 $1  31. Nxc5  bxa5 {[%emt 0:00:05] At this point Ding put in a lot of
thought. Out of nowhere he was suddenly in a position where he might have to
suffer. The a-pawn is very strong and he has to find accurate ways to not let
it queen.} 32. Bc4  (32. Nxe6 a4 33. Nd4 a3 34. Nb3 Bf7 35. Na1 Kf8 $15) 32...
