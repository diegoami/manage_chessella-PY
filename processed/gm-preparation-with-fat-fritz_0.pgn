Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. O-O O-O 6. Re1 {Literally the only move we hadn't deeply prepared against before this game. The Turkish League was one of the few tournaments where Nihal was at the receiving end of the negative side of chance.} Ng4 7. Re2 Kh8 8. h3 f5 9. Bg5 Nf6 10. exf5 d5 11. Bb5 {[#] This is the critical point where Black has to decide between Nd4 and e4. While a brute force engine would point towards e4, a NN engine points toward Nd4 right away!} Nd4 (11... e4 {A brute force move which is very concrete.} 12. dxe4 dxe4 13. Qxd8 Rxd8 14.

However, it is not easy to get here. It is also not a draw yet, as World Champion Magnus has been teaching the chess world over the last decade. The game could continue} 19. Rd2 Rc1 20. Rd1 Rxc2 21. Rxd6 Rxb2 22. Nd2 {A 0.00 like position where I would hold very confidently in a correspondence game. In an OTB game, I wouldn't be completely sure against a very strong opponent. Such equalish positions can very easily turn into suffering.}) 12. Nxd4 Bxd4 (12... exd4 $1 {A very deep idea which the NN engine sees instantly. Brute force engines also get there, but you have to bring them to it and wait for them to comprehend. This used to be the way we found hidden ideas when analyzing with powerful brute force engines - make moves ourselves and let the engine catch up. However, with a NN engine, the percentage of such 'blind shots' increase substantially, and it also saves a lot of time. White's b5 bishop is totally sidelined now and Black gets full compensation due to the much better functioning of his pieces, despite being a pawn down and the structure being unusual. This exact position from the opening is not very likely to reoccur, but I was very impressed by this unusual strategic idea. These are the building blocks of evolution of human chess understanding.} 13. g4 c6 14. Ba4 a5 15. a3 Qd6 {Black's compensation is clear and the position frightening. If this happened over the board, Black has excellent practical chances.}) 13. c3 Bb6 14. Rxe5 c6 15. Ba4 Bc7 16. d4 $1 $14 Qd7 17. Bxf6 Rxf6 18. g4 Bxe5 19. dxe5 Rf8 20. Nd2 Qc7 21. Nf3 Qe7 22.
