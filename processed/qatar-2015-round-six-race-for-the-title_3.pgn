{If ever you were in doubt about how important space advantage is then you
should have a look at this game!} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. e3 O-O 5.
Be2 {This line with not committing your knight to c3 is becoming quite popular
against Grunfeld experts. ...d5 now would not be so great due to cxd5 Nxd5 and
e4, and there is no knight to exchange on c3.} d6 (5... c5 $5 {It could be the
best idea to transpose the game into a Benoni structure where e3 is not such a
dangerous line.}) 6. O-O Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. Qc2 Re8 9. Re1 exd4 (9... e4 10. Nd2
Qe7 {is a reversed King's Indian Attack. Being Black the attack might not be
very dangerous, but it is better than what happened in the game.}) 10. exd4 Nb6
11. Bf4 {White now has a static advantage that is difficult to neutralize due
to the symmetrical pawn structure.} Bf5 12. Bd3 Bxd3 13. Qxd3 Qd7 14. b3 Rxe1+
15. Rxe1 Re8 16. Rxe8+ Qxe8 17. h3 {So what exactly is White's advantage? In
one simple word it is - space! White has so much space in this position that it
is extremely difficult for Black to find a constructive plan. And Ni Hua is
pretty good at converting such technical dry positions.} a6 18. a4 Nbd7 19. a5
Qd8 20. b4 b6 {Tired of waiting passively, Vidit lashes out, but now the a6
pawn becomes weak.} 21. axb6 Nxb6 22. Bg5 Qa8 23. Bxf6 Bxf6 24. c5 Nd7 (24...
Nd5 25. Qe4 c6 26. Nxd5 cxd5 27. Qf4 $16) 25. Qc4 dxc5 26. bxc5 a5 27. Nd2 Bg7
28. Nde4 Nf6 (28... h6 29. d5 Qe8 {is better than what happened in the game,
but this still looks pretty rishy for Black.}) 29. d5 Nxe4 30. Nxe4 a4 31. d6
$1 {The d-pawn is much more dangerous than the a-pawn.} a3 32. dxc7 Qb7 33. Qd5
$1 a2 (33... Qxd5 34. c8=Q+ Bf8 35. Nf6+ $18) (33... Qxc7 34. Qa8+ $1 Bf8 35.
Nf6+ Kg7 36. Ne8+ $18) 34. Qxb7 (34. Qxb7 a1=Q+ 35. Kh2 Qe5+ 36. g3 $18 { A
superb game by Ni Hua who showed why Space is one of the important assets to
have in the game of chess.}) 1-0
