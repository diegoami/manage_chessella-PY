He has the open d-file in his control. 2. The knight on g6 lacks good squares. It would love to park itself on the juicy d4 square, but it's extremely difficult to get there. 3. There are quite a few pawn weaknesses in Black's position. All in all it's a pretty depressing position for Caruana.} Nf8 31. Ba4 (31. Qd6 $1 Qxd6 (31... Qf7 32. Rd2 $16) 32. Rxd6 Kf7 33. c5 Ke7 34.

However, it seemed as if Topalov didn't want his a2 pawn to be fixed.}) 43... axb2 44. Kxb2 Kh7 45. Kc2 Rc8 $5 {Caruana tries to muddy the water provoking White to play Ba6 in order to win material. A psychological ploy.} 46. Ba6 { Topalov could have just continued with Kd2 going to the kingside. However winning the exchange/rook was just too tempting for Topalov.} Qa7 47. Bxc8 Qxa2+ {White has won a rook but Black has finally broken free!} 48.
