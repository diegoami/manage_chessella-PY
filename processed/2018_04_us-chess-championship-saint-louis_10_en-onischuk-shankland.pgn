Bf5 {The modern treatment of the Queens Gambit Declined is a true wonder of
the XXI Century. Black plays fast and loose with his bishops, seemingly paying
no attention to undefended pawns on b7 and d5.} 9. a3 ({Probably,} 9. Qb3 {
is more to the point, but White isn't always successful with it.}) 9... Bxc3+
10. bxc3 Nbd7 11. Be2 c5 12. O-O {[#] In the classical Rubinstein Nimzo the
white bishop remains behind its own pawns for a while. Here it's on g5,
pinning the knight. This difference used to be acknowledged as a defining
factor in White's attempts to obtain advantage.} g5 $1 {A radical solution to
the problem outlined above.} 13. Bg3 Ne4 $5 {It is very unusual to allow White
to move his c-pawn.} ({The thematic move for such structures is always} 13...
c4 {Black's Bf5 is the key piece to the entire setup: it helps to protect the
king, stops e3-e4 amd even takes the b1-square away from the white rook.}) 14.
c4 {Onischuk must have been reasonably happy with his position.} dxc4 ({
The next step in the evolution of the QGD might be} 14... b5 $5) 15. Bxc4 Rc8
16. Rc1 Qe7 17. Bd3 ({White has no reason to trust} 17. d5 Rfd8 18. d6 Qf6 {
and the brave pawn suddenly feels kind of lonely up there.}) 17... Rfd8 18. Qe2
Nb6 {[#]} 19. Bxe4 $6 {Alex is just having a nighmare of a tournament.} ({
White needed to hold the tension for just one more move,} 19. Rfe1 $1 {putting
the ball in the opponent's court. It won't be easy for Black to continue, e.g.}
Bg6 (19... Nd5 20. Bxe4 Bxe4 21. h4) (19... Nxg3 20. hxg3 Bxd3 21. Qxd3 c4 22.
Qf5) 20. Bxe4 Bxe4 21. Ne5 cxd4 22. Rxc8 Rxc8 23. exd4 Bf5 24. Qf3 {and the
extra move with the rook to open file comes in handy.}) 19... Bxe4 20. Ne5 cxd4

the favor.} ({It was very much unlike him to miss a back rank tactic,} 28...

is just better in the endgame. For a while Onischuk fights well.} 31. Rf3 Nd5

42. Bxg5 Kc4 43. Rg3 Nc3 $1 {With this precise move Black intends to keep the
white king away from the Q-side.} (43... Rc3 {was premature, as the d-pawn is
still alive:} 44. Rxc3+ Kxc3 45. Ke2 Kxd4 (45... Kb3 46. Kd3 Kxa3 {allows big
time counterplay,} 47. Kc4 $11) 46. Kd2 Kc4 47. Kc2 {and White holds a draw.})
44. d5 {White hardly had anything better than this.} Nxd5 {[#]} 45. Kd1 $2 {
Missing Black's main idea.} (45. Bd2 {had to be played, still with drawing
chances after} Nc3 46. Rg7 Ne4 47. Bf4 a5 48. Bc7) 45... Rc3 $1 {The a3-pawn
is going to be lost, and it's game over.} 46. Rg4+ Kb3 47. Rd4 Ne3+ 48. Bxe3
