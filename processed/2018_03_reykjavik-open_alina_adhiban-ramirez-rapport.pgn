{One of AD's strongest character traits is his ability of treating each game
as an entity of its own. He might have lost five games in a row and yet he
will approach the 6th in the same uncompromising manner, playing for a win.
For many, success breeds success, but for Adhiban failure breeds success too.
Some may be unjustifiably laughing in their sleeves when the Indian GM would
share his aspirations but he has the guts, without offending anyone, to speak
his mind out. Without this strong belief, on both cognitive and emotional
level, dreams will remain just that: dreams. A less convincing start cannot
stay in AD's way. He won a very convincing game in R6, punishing in a very
rough manner the only innacuracy that Black made.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5

White's favour at the same 27th move.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4
5. e4 {A bold approach for a decisive game.} b5 6. Be2 {Off the beaten path
and an interesting way to play. It should be mentioned that AD is obviously
working very hard to reach his goals and his openings are fresh, full with
original ideas. I know this because I also used some of his suggestions.
Luckily, he is not afraid of sharing his secrets!} ({More known is} 6. e5 Nd5
