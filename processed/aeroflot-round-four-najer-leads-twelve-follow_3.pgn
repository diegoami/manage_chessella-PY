{It is clear that
Black has more space. He is the one who is pressing, but White is quite
solid. In such positions it is important to begin with a mini plan. The
first thing that seems like extremely important to make even an iota of
progress is to get in the c5 break. That is what Vallejo does.} 36...
Kd6 37. R1e2 c5 {Stage one of the plan is completed. Is White forced to
capture on c5 and give Black a central majority? Of course accepting an
isolated pawn on d4 is no fun, but could it have been better?} 38. dxc5+
(38. Rc2 c4 $1 $17 { Later on we can push a second pawn to c5. Besides
the king can make his way all the way to b3 to put pressure on the b2
pawn. This looks pretty grim.} ( 38... cxd4 39. cxd4 {gives White some
activity down the c-file.})) 38... Kxc5 39. Rd2 {Now the logical plan
is to push the pawn to c5, get the king to e5 and try for the d4 break.
But good players never rush. They lure their opponents into a false sense
of security, and then break through.} c6 40. Ke1 Ra4 41. Kd1 Kd6 42. Ke1
Ke5 43. Rd1 Ra8 44. Re2 Rf3 45. Rd4 Rf7 46. Rd3 Raf8 47. Rd4 c5 $1 {After
getting all the pieces in perfect location, Black finally goes for the
breakthrough. And there is nothing White can do about it.} 48. Rd1 d4
49. cxd4+ cxd4 50. Red2 (50. Rc1 d3 51. Rd2 Kd4 {transposes to the game.})
50... d3 51. Rc1 Kd4 52. Rc6 Rf6 53. Rc7 R6f7 54. Rc6 Rf5 55. b4 Rd8 56.
Re6 Rf3 57. Kd1 Rdf8 58. Ke1 Rd8 59. Kd1 e3 $1 {And that move brings down
the curtains.} 60. fxe3+ Rxe3 61. Rh6 Rxg3 {A very nice endgame by Vallejo,
who showed the importance of making mini plans rather than grand schemes
which are not so easy to formulate during the game.} 0-1
