1. b3 {For some reason, I can almost never will myself to play 1.e4 against
stronger players.} d5 2. Bb2 Bg4 3. Nf3 Nd7 4. g3 e6 5. Bg2 Ngf6 6. c4 c6 7. h3
Bxf3 {A slightly surprising decision for me. Probably this is a sign that
Black is content to hold a draw.} (7... Bh5 {was more normal, and here I
intended} 8. O-O Bd6 9. d3 O-O 10. Nbd2 {, when Black must be prepared to play
without the bishop pair if he wants any central play, but otherwise the
position is completely equal. For instance:} a5 11. a3 e5 12. cxd5 cxd5 13. g4
Bg6 14. Nh4 Re8 15. Nxg6 hxg6 16. e3 Nc5 17. Qb1 $11 {Karjakin,S-Giri,A Wijk
aan Zee 2016}) 8. Bxf3 Bd6 9. Bg2 O-O 10. O-O $2 {The beginning of a bizarre
back-and-forth episode of chess blindness.} (10. e3 {or something was normal
and equal.}) 10... a5 (10... dxc4 {was possible, with the point} 11. bxc4 Bxg3
$1 {which I completely missed. Luckily, the line doesn't end here, but even
after} 12. Ba3 Bc7 13. Bxf8 Qxf8 $15 {Black has a considerable advantage.}) 11.
a4 Re8 {Again, ...dxc4 was possible.} 12. e3 Nc5 13. d4 Nce4 14. Qc2 (14. Nd2
Nxd2 15. Qxd2 Ne4 $36 {was not the kind of position I wanted to sign up for,
especially following the Nihal Sarin game from the previous set on this site!})

this diagonal, but this one keeps me guessing about whether or not he intends .
..b5.} 16. Nc3 Nxc3 17. Bxc3 Bxc3 18. Qxc3 Qd6 (18... Ne4 19. Bxe4 dxe4 20. b4
$14 {seems good for White}) 19. Rfb1 Re7 $5 {This move surprised me, and the
engine doesn't rate it that highly, but Black's active alternatives give me
easy enough play.} (19... e5 20. dxe5 Qxe5 21. Qxe5 Rxe5 22. Rb2 $1 {can only
be fun for White, as Black has to choose between an IQP and a half-open b-file.
}) (19... Qb4 20. Qxb4 axb4 21. a5 $14 {is a disaster}) (19... c5 20. cxd5 cxd4

Rb3 $14 {must favour White if there is no immediate way to take advantage of
the confused way his pieces are laid out right now}) 26. g5 Ng8 27. c5 h5 $1 {
Black recognises that in the distant future, I would rather like to open a
second front on the kingside, and accordingly forces me to either open it now,
or forever leave it closed.} 28. gxh6 ({The alternative was to leave it closed.
For instance:} 28. Bf1 Ne7 29. Kg3 g6 30. Kf2 Ke8 31. Ra1 Kd8 32. a5 Kc8 $11 {
and White lacks an actual way in}) 28... Nxh6 29. e4 {Overestimating my
position slightly.} dxe4 30. Bxe4 g6 31. Kg3 Ng8 32. Kf2 Nf6 33. Bf3 Ke8 34.
Ke3 Kd8 35. a5 Kc8 36. Ra4 Rc7 {Just in case I wanted a6.} 37. h4 Ng8 $6 {
This might give me a little something to work with.} (37... Re7 $11 {was the
principled decision, noting that a6 is well met with ...Nd5.}) 38. h5 gxh5 39.
Bxh5 Ne7 40. Bf3 Rd7 41. Rh1 Rd8 (41... Kc7 42. Rh8 Rd8 43. Rh7 Rd7 44. Kd3 $36
) 42. Rh7 Rf8 43. Be4 $6 {Giving up my small chance.} (43. Ra1 $1 {is better
for White, e.g.} Nf5+ 44. Ke4 $1 Kd8 45. Bg4 $14) (43. Ke4 Nd5 44. Ke5 {
was something I considered, but the computer points out the nice tactic} b5 $1

over here, this is not something to be playing for.}) ({I rejected} 43. Bh5 {
because of} b5 $1 44. cxb6 Nd5+ 45. Kd3 Nxb6 46. Ra1 Nd5 {but in fact this is
not a terrible try after} 47. f5 $5 exf5 48. Bf3 $44) 43... Ra8 $1 44. Ra1 {
Now this is a bit late.} Kd7 45. Kd2 Ra7 (45... Ke8 $6 46. Rb1 Ra7 {walks into}
47. a6 $16) 46. Kc3 Ke8 47. Kb4 $6 {Not a bad move, but the beginning of a
panic, which is never good.} (47. Rb1 $1 {was much better, noting that after}
Rg8 $6 {there is once again} 48. a6 $1 {The lines are not totally trivial but
should have been within my capacity to work out, e.g.} Rg3+ 49. Kc2 $1 {
I vaguely saw this possibility but assumed Black would give mate or win
something, since he has the first check.} (49. Kc4 Nd5 $15) 49... Rxa6 50. Rxb7

it is White who is faced with more practical problems.}) 49... Kd7 50. Bf3 (50.

Rf1 $11 {still holds, but Black can play all sorts of tricks in mutual
time-trouble.}) 52... Rag8 {Now Black is clearly better.} 53. a6 $2 {And this
just precipitates the end.} bxa6 54. Ka5 Rg3 55. R1h3 Rxh3 56. Rxh3 Rg4 57. Rf3

resistance}) 58... Nd5 59. Rb3 Rxf4 60. Rb7+ Kc8 61. Rh7 Rxd4 62. Ba4 {
Dreaming of stalemates, but they are not even close to happening.} Rc4 63. Rh8+
Kb7 {A good win for the Black player, who kept calm and just let me over-press
until it rebounded on me.} 0-1
