Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Nbd7 {This is a small tweak in the opening. Main moves are of course Be7 which leads to the QGD and Bb4 which leads to the Ragozin. With this move Nbd7, Black keeps the game in QGD territory but gets some additional options.} 5. Bg5 (5. Bf4 c6 6. e3 Nh5 {Though only tried in blitz by Carlsen and Kramnik, it could be possible that Kramnik was intending to play this today and that is the reason why he chose 4...Nbd7 move order.}) 5... h6 6. Bh4 Be7 7. e3 O-O 8. Rc1 c5 9. cxd5 Nxd5 (9... exd5 10. Bd3 $14 { is a definite edge for White from the opening.}) 10. Bxe7 Nxe7 {White should be slightly better here. Black has played the opening quite unambitiously. But White's advantage is not very threatening as Kramnik proves over the next few moves.} 11. Be2 {The bishop looks much better placed on e2 than on d3.} (11. Bd3 b6 12. O-O Bb7 13. Qe2 (13. e4 cxd4 14. Nxd4 Ng6 $15) 13... Bxf3 $1 14. Qxf3 cxd4 15. exd4 Nf6 $11 {In this IQP position where two pairs of minor pieces have been exchanged and also the d5-square is under the control of the knights, Black shouldn't be worse.}) 11... b6 12.

But I am nowhere near Kramnik's technique so it's better that I do not get into it! The position however looks completely drawish.}) 14... Nf5 $5 15. Nxf5 exf5 {Why would Kramnik voluntarily double his pawns? Maybe he just wanted to unbalance the position in some way or the other, no matter how little.} 16. Bf3 $6 {I dislike this move. It might be objectively fine but if White wanted to play safely then why not just exchange the queens and play Rfd1?} (16. Qxd8 Rfxd8 17. Rfd1 $11) 16... Qxd1 17. Rfxd1 Bxf3 18. gxf3 Rfd8 19. Kf1 {Bringing the king into the centre is natural.} (19. Rxd8+ Rxd8 20. Rd1 Rxd1+ 21. Nxd1 {This position might not hold any advantage for Black but it is a very timid decision of trying to exchange both the rooks and bringing your knight to an unfavourable square. Something that Salem Saleh being an aggressive player would dislike. Also White has no reasons to resort to such exchanging operations.}) 19... g6 20. Ke2 Kg7 21. Nb5 Kf6 22. Rxd8 Rxd8 23. b4 (23.

Ne5 {And it is White who is creating some dangerous play.}) 29... g5 $1 (29... h5 {was also possible but the move g5 has a very deep idea behind it. Kramnik wants to keep the h5-square free for his king which would embark on a journey to attack the h2-pawn.}) (29... Rc6 $5 30. Kd3 Ng5 31. f4 Nh3 32. f3 Nf2+ 33. Kd2 Rd6+ 34.

Ra7 Kg6 32. Na2 Nd8 33. Ke1 $2 {Why waste time? It would have been better to execute the manoeuvre of putting the N on c5 via Nc1-b3-c5.} Kh5 {As Lasker said, "It is better to follow out a plan consistently even if it isn't the best one than to play without a plan at all". Here Black has a clear-cut plan of attacking the h2-pawn while White is doing nothing much. That is the main reason why his position slowly goes downhill.} 34. Nc1 Kh4 35. Nb3 Kh3 {Doesn't this king route remind you of the game Cohn-Rubinstein that was played in St.Petersburg in 1909 where the God of endgame play marched his king to the h3-square in a pure pawn endgame to attack the weak pawn on h2. It could be possible that Kramnik was motivated to find this idea from that game of Rubinstein.} 36. Nd4 (36. Nc5 Kxh2 37. Rxa6 Rxa6 38. Nxa6 Kg2 $19 {The h-pawn queens easily.}) 36... f4 37.

The thing that was impressive about this game was that even though Vladimir was in a must win situation and he was facing an opponent who was rated 200 points below him, he wasn't afraid to go into equal positions. He found those little imbalances like the h2-pawn weakness which would help him to put pressure on the opponent. Using all his technical superiority he ground out a win!}) 0-1
