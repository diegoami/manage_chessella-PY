Qxa7 {Perunovic, with white, finds himself in a difficult situation. His position is still ok but he has to somehow win this position. Wang Hao's two powerful rooks should force White to give a perpetual at some point, but even if he doesn't he just needs to not do naything and White can't really cause problems.} Ne2+ (28...
