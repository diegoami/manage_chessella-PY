been many examples of strong players trying} Bb4+ 5. Nbd2 O-O 6. Bg2 {, which
is another way the game position after 6.Ngf3 can arise.}) 4. Nd2 {The knight
is not optimally placed here, which makes it worth it for Black to lose a
tempo with the bishop.} ({After} 4. Bd2 {Black can chose between the Bogo
Indian set-ups with a5, or Qe7, bt is also quite possible to play} Be7 {

for the pawn, in Grischuk,A (2750)-Nakamura,H (2785) Moscow Grand Prix 2017.})
({The usual remedy against Nbd2, is to play} 6... c5 {, since the d5-pawn will
be less of a target than if the knight had gone to c3. Here} 7. a3 Bxd2+ 8.
Qxd2 $1 {Also looks somewhat better for White. There is no direct way for
Black to take advantage of the slight weaness of the light squares.}) 7. O-O
Bb7 {More than 10% of all games with this position were played during the last
year, so it is something of a fashionable "tabiya". Now White has a wide
choice:} 8. a3 (8. Ne5 {looks most principled, but allows Black to force
exchanges.} Nbd7 9. Qa4 Bd6 10. Nxd7 (10. Nc6 $6 Qe8 {[%cal Gd7c5]}) 10... Qxd7

that is why Anand avoided.}) 13. e4 Bb7 14. Rd1 $14 {Lenderman,A (2565)-Anand,
V (2790) chess.com IoM Masters 2017}) (8. cxd5 exd5 9. Ne5 Re8 10. Ndf3 $6 Ne4

dominate the game for a long time.}) (8. b3 {is a harmonious move that makes a
lot of sense. After} Qe7 9. Bb2 a5 10. a3 Bd6 11. Qc2 Na6 $6 (11... c5 $1 $132)

11. Bb2 Ba6 12. Ne5 Nfd7 {White is slightly better, but Black usually fares
well in these structures as long as the light squared bishop does not get
boxed in.}) 9. cxd5 exd5 10. b4 a5 $5 {This move surprised me a lot, since it
leads to a pawn structure that can only be better for White. However, there is
more to chess than pawn structures.} (10... c6 {preparing ...a5, would be the
standard reaction here. I cannot spot a clear way for White to keep an
advantage here, but perhaps the move in the game is just more challenging?!})
11. b5 (11. Rb1 $6 axb4 12. axb4 Nc6 $1 13. b5 Nb4 {was already promising for
Black, in Firat,B (2480)-Pap,M (2490) 5th Pontevedra Open 2017.}) 11... c6 $1
12. bxc6 Nxc6 {A highly unusual position, where White would be better if only
Nd2 was on c3 instead. Intuitively I would say that White is better if he can
get control of the light squares on the queenside (when White can continue
with Bb2 and Ne5, tageting the d5-pawn), but it is not that easy, at all.} 13.

time being, is another possibility. After} Ba6 14. Re1 b5 15. Ne5 Nxd4 16. e3
Ne6 17. Nc6 Qd7 18. Nxe7+ Qxe7 19. Nb3 Ne4 20. Bb2 {White has some
compensation for the pawn, but hardly enough to claim an advantage.}) 13... a4
{Earlier champions of the Black side have used a simple but effective
game-plan; to push the a- and b-pawn, while using the c4- and e4-square as
outposts, but we will see Gelfand take a more flexible stand, waiting for the
right moment to push. White will try to coordinate his forces and - hopefully
- set up a blockade on b4. In order to achieve the latter, Nc6 must be
exchanged.} ({Gelfand improves on a much earlier game:} 13... b5 {leaves
White's knight with a route to c5.} 14. Ne5 {...which is missed.} (14. Nb3 $5

moment when it is more awkward to meet.}) 16. Nxc6 Bxc6 17. Bc3 {Hooray!!
White has succeeded in blockading the b-pawn. That seems like a success,
especially if we think of the bishop on g2 as "good" and the one on c6 as
"bad". But, we shouldn't think of it that way. In fact, the bishop on g2 is
not yet in the game, while Bc6 has easy access to f5. In the meanwhile White's
knight looks really out of place. It is important for White not to celebrate
the blockade for too long and forget about the other guys.} Rfc8 18. e3 $6 {
A slow move that adds little to White's position. Why not play} (18. Bb4 $1 {
immediately? Black has two choices:} Ra7 $1 {is clearly the best} (18... Qd8

looks too contrived, but}) (20... Rc2 {is a worthy alternative. Perhaps
Gelfand wanted to have the queen in front of the rook in case of exchanges on
the c-file?!}) 21. Nf3 {It looks like White is slowly succeding in everything
he'd dreamed of. Next the knight is going to d3 via e5, no?} ({White is unable
to challenge Black for control of the c-file:} 21. Rfc1 Rac8 22. Rxc7 Qxc7 23.

along. Perhaps White can keep this together, but the defence looks difficult.})

go to d3 and the rook cannot go to b1. What to do?} 23. Ra2 {That looks
sensible. The rook can attack b5 from b2.} Ne4 $1 24. Rb2 Nc3 {Everything
protected.} 25. Ra1 $2 {White squanders his last chance to change the course
of the game. If I was White I would do anything within my power to avoid what
