        g6 3. e3 $5 {Nakamura plays something offbeat to get an original position.} 
        Bg7 4. c4 O-O 5. Be2 {By not developing his knight on c3 White dissuades 
        Black from playing the Grunfeld.} c5 (5... d5 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. e4 {is considered 
        pleasant for White.}) 6. d5 d6 7. Nc3 e6 8. O-O exd5 9. cxd5 {Now we are 
        in Benoni territory where White has played the e3 Be2 line. Of course 
        this is in no way theoretically threatening, especially because White 
        will be a tempo down in the main lines when he has to go e3-e4. However, 
        the position is still quite interesting and White can hope for a small 
        edge.} Na6 10. Nd2 Rb8 11. e4 Re8 12. f3 Nh5 13. f4 Nf6 14. Kh1 Nc7 15. 
        a4 a6 16. a5 Bd7 { Black has a very comfortable version of the Benoni. 
        White's pieces are clumsily placed. Black can use the b5 square for his 
        own pieces.} 17. Bf3 Nb5 18. e5 $6 dxe5 19. fxe5 Rxe5 $17 {Nakamura sacrifices 
        a pawn to muddy the waters, but the position is just clearly better for 
        Black.} 20. Nc4 Rf5 21. Ne2 Rxf3 $5 {A very interesting exchange sacrifice.} 
        (21... Ng4 $1 22. Bxg4 Rxf1+ 23. Qxf1 Bxg4 $17 {was even stronger.}) 22. 
        gxf3 Bh3 23. Re1 Qxd5 24. Nf4 Qxd1 25. Rxd1 {Black has two pawns for the 
        exchange and excellent co-ordination.} Bd7 26. Be3 Bc6 27. Kg2 Re8 28.

        gxf3 $1 {would have lead to a winning position for Black but requires 
        great deal of calculation.} 33. Bh6 Ne4+ $1 34. Ke3 (34. Kxf3 $2 Ng5+ 
        $19) 34... Kh7 $1 35. Bxg7 f2 $1 36. Rg2 Nd4 $19 {and Black is a complete 
        rook down, but with threats like Nc2+ he has a winning position. Of course 
        this is not so easy to see during the game.}) 33. Nxc4 $11 {The worst 
        is over for White.} Nd5 34. fxg4 Nxe3 35. Nxe3 Bxb2 36. Rae1 Bc3 37. Re2
