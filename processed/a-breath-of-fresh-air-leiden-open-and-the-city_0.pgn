Let's have a look at how Frank Van Tellingen, rated nearly 250 points below his opponent, was able to win in spectacular style.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The Najdorf is always a recipe for interesting chess.} 6. Bg5 Nbd7 (6... e6 {is by far the main move.}) 7. Bc4 Qb6 8. O-O Qc5 $5 {With this move Black starts extremely concrete play by attacking the bishop on c4 and the one on g5.} 9. Bd5 {The only way to fight for an advantage.} (9. Bxf6 Nxf6 $11 {is completely fine for Black.}) 9... e6 10. Re1 $1 (10. Nxe6 {was tried in a game but cannot be any good} fxe6 11. Be3 Qa5 12. Bxe6 Ne5 {Black was fine in Krivoborodov,E (2514)-Eliseev,U (2473) Moscow 2012, 0-1 (52)}) {[#]} 10... Ne5 $5 $146 {Frank's novelty for the game. He had clearly come very well prepared.} (10... Be7 {was the move played in all the eight games before.} 11. Be3 Qa5 12. Bxe6 fxe6 13. Nxe6 Kf7 14. Ng5+ {And now all the three moves Kf8, Kg8 and Ke8 have been played. Immersion in this position might be a good way for you improve your analytical ability.}) (10... exd5 {is too risky as after} 11. exd5+ Kd8 (11... Be7 12. Nf5 $16) (11... Ne5 12. f4 $1 $16) 12. Qd2 $44 { White has long term compensation and it is very difficult for Black to wriggle out of the mess.}) 11. Bxf6 $6 (11. Bb3 {might have been better.}) 11... gxf6 12. Bb3 {White tries for the simplistic approach to save his piece. But as we all know very well, in a sharp line of the Sicilian Najdorf such an unambitious approach means that Black gets easy equality.} h5 13. Na4 Qa7 14. c4 {White's Maroczy structure without the dark squared bishop holds no danger for Black.} Bd7 15. h3 Rc8 {Consistent and simple: Black brings all his pieces into play. He will soon open the position for his bishops with b5.} 16. Rc1 b5 $1 {Maybe objectively this is not the best move but it leads to some very interesting complications.} (16... Rg8 $17 {Keeping the position was also possible.}) 17. cxb5 {White tries to play tactically but this is out of desperation as his position is falling apart.} (17. Nc3 bxc4 {is quite depressing.}) 17... Rxc1 $1 {A brave decision not fearing the move b6.} 18. b6 $1 {One must congratulate Arthur for finding this idea. The game becomes extremely sharp as we see Black sacrificing the queen and the rook picking up all the white major pieces.} (18. Qxc1 Qxd4 $19) 18... Rxd1 19. bxa7 Rxe1+ { When was the last time you saw a rook picking up three enemy major pieces in three moves!} 20. Kh2 {The king has moved to safety and the a-pawn cannot be stopped from queening.} Bg7 21. a8=Q+ {A new queen is born and the material is around equal on the board - two rooks for a queen.} Ke7 22. Qa7 (22. Qb7 { The computer recommends this move but I think it is pretty difficult for a human to understand why this would be better than Qa7. Although if we try to understand deeper we realize that}) 22... f5 {This is not the best move as White can take advantage of it with some straightforward play.} (22... h4 23. Nb6 Bh6 24. Nc6+ Nxc6 25. Qxd7+ (25. Nxd7 {And now you cannot take on d7 with the knight because the queen on a7 is hanging. That's the reason why Qb7 was better but who could even imagine all of this!}) 25... Kf8 26. Qxc6 Bf4+ 27. g3 hxg3+ 28. Kg2 $13 {with unclear play.}) 23. f3 $2 {Missing the chance.} (23. Nb6 Ng4+ 24. hxg4 hxg4+ 25. Kg3 {This looks scary but White is surviving after} Be5+ 26. f4 Bxd4 27. Qxd7+ Kf6 28. Nd5+ $1 Kg7 29. exf5 exd5 30. Bxd5 {and the king on g3 is safe.}) 23... h4 (23... f4 $1 $17) 24. exf5 $2 {The final mistake of the game. Although by this point it is extremely difficult to condemn White's play as the position is so complicated.} Bh6 $1 {The mating net around the white king is tightened.} 25. fxe6 Bf4+ 26. g3 hxg3+ 27. Kg2 Rxh3 $1 {Rh2 mate is threatened.} 28. Nc6+ (28. Kxh3 Rh1+ 29. Kg2 Rh2+ 30. Kf1 g2+ 31. Kg1 Be3+ 32. Kxh2 g1=Q+ $19) 28... Kf6 29. Kxh3 Rh1+ 30. Kg2 Rh2+ 31. Kf1 Bxc6 {Bb5+ check is a threat and so is g2 followed by g1=Q. A very interesting game and one that was optically quite beautiful. Kudos to both the players Pijpers and Tellingen, because it always takes two to tango!} 0-1
