Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nf6 4. Nc3 cxd4 5. Nxd4 a6 {Markus has become quite versatile in his White repertoire. He used to play exclusively 1. e4, but nowadays he can pretty much play anything. Still, the next move should not have come as a surprise to Xiong.} 6. h3 {A first in Markus's own games, but... he started to work with Harikrishna last year and Hari has already employed 6.h3 a couple of times! It is very important to piece such information together and I am sure Jeffery will take this as an important lesson from this encounter.} e5 {This has established itself as the main reply to 6.h3 although White is precisely readying himself for the weakening of the d5 square. Just visually speaking I always liked e7-e6 more, when the inclusion of h3 and a6 are certainly in Black's favor, especially when you think of the Keres Attack.} 7. Nde2 b5 (7... h5 {had been played by Xiong before and is clearly the main line, but isn't it a really odd move? White´s knights are lined up to control d5, and Black weakens the g5 square, where the c1 bishop usually appears to support the fight for d5. You can tell I am old school, but this whole line is clearly something special.}) 8. Ng3 {A rare move with only a few outings at the highest level (2 out of 7 by Harikrishna!). Judging from Xiong's time usage he was not aware of this line. White chooses a manouvering battle and keeps the king-side a safe haven for his monarch.} (8. g4 {is the straightforward alternative.}) 8... Qc7 (8... Bb7 {appears more natural, but} 9. Bg5 Nbd7 10. Nh5 $1 {would be quite irritating}) 9. Bd3 (9. Nh5 Nxh5 (9... Nbd7 $142) 10. Qxh5 (10. Nd5 $142) 10... Be6 11. a4 b4 12. Nd5 Bxd5 13. exd5 Qxc2 $13 {1-0 (35) Harikrishna,P (2753)-Wojtaszek,R (2727) Huaian 2016}) 9... Be6 (9... g6 10. O-O Bg7 11. Bg5 Nbd7 12. Re1 (12. Qd2 $142) 12... O-O 13. Nf1 b4 14. Nb1 Bb7 15. Nbd2 d5 $15 {0-1 (74) Motylev,A (2663)-Sarana,A (2457) Tallinn 2016}) 10. O-O Nbd7 11. f4 {This introduces a very instructive positional idea: Eventually f4-f5 will force the bishop to c4, and after its exchange White will exploit the d5 weakness.} (11. Qf3 {is worth considering } g6 12. Bd2 Bg7 13. b4 $1 O-O 14. a4 {leads to an advantage}) 11... Be7 12. Qf3 O-O 13. Kh1 {Useful prophylaxis} (13. f5 {is premature:} Bc4 14. Bg5 b4 15. Nd1 d5 16. Ne3 Bc5 $1) 13... Qc6 ({Knowing what happened in the game} 13... exf4 14. Bxf4 Ne5 {has to be preferred. While White does have a nice outpost on f5, Black appears very solid after} 15. Qf2 Rfe8 16. Rad1 Bf8) 14. f5 $1 Bc4 15. Bg5 Rac8 (15... b4 16. Nd1 d5 17. Ne3 $16) 16. Nh5 $1 {Now it is all about removing the defenders of the d5 square.} b4 17. Bxf6 Nxf6 18. Nxf6+ Bxf6 19. Bxc4 Qxc4 (19... bxc3 $2 20. b3 {is just winning, Black's bishop is useless.}) 20. Nd5 Qxc2 21. b3 {White has achieved his strategic goal at the cost of an unimportant pawn. Black is not lost, but he faces a difficult defensive task, as White can choose an opportune moment to launch his attack. Black needs to be ready for action but he cannot force it.} a5 22. Qe3 {Eyeing h6 after a capture on f6.} Kh8 $2 {The king is not a bit safer here, it turns out that Black had to prepare an exit in the other direction.} (22... Rfe8 $1 23. Rf2 Qc5 24. Qg3 Kf8 {would be tough to break, as Black controls the c-file and his king can always find shelter on e7 after an exchange on f6.}) 23. Rac1 $1 { White forces matters, as his calculations convinced him that he can start a winning attack.} Qxa2 24. Nxf6 Rxc1 25. Rxc1 gxf6 26. Qh6 Kg8 27. Qxf6 $2 { I am sure Markus thought he was winning here, and it's hard to blame him for missing an impressive defensive resource.} (27. Rf1 $1 Rc8 28. Qxf6 (28. Rf3 $2 Rc3) 28... Qxb3 29. Rf3 Rc3 30. Qd8+ Kg7 31. f6+ Kg6 32. Qg8+ {mates}) 27... Qd2 28. Rf1 Re8 $2 (28... h5 $3 29. Rf3 (29. Qh4 Qh6 30. f6 Re8 $1 31. Rf5 Re6) 29... Kh7 30. Rg3 Qh6 {the point!} 31. Qe7 a4 32. f6 Kh8 33. Rg5 Qxg5 34. Qxf8+ Qg8 {is just a draw!}) 29. Rf3 {Now the attack is irresistible} a4 30. Rg3+ Kf8 31. Qg7+ Ke7 32. f6+ Kd8 (32... Ke6 33. Qg4+ Kxf6 34. Qd7 Rf8 35. bxa4 {And the a-pawn will be one worry too many for Black.}) 33. Qxf7 a3 { The a-pawn alone cannot help Black.} 34. Qa7 Qc1+ 35. Kh2 Qf4 36. Qb8+ Kd7 37. Qb5+ Kd8 38. Qxb4 h5 39. Qxd6+ Kc8 40. Qc6+ Kd8 41. f7 $1 {A nice finishing touch to a strong game by Markus! Xiong was cuaght off-balance in the opening and the pressure turned out too much to bare. It is very difficult to catch an unexpected defensive resource when you see your position getting worse and worse and already understand that the day will probably end badly.} 1-0
