Ne4 9. Nxe4 Bxe4 10. d5 Bxf3 11. exf3 Nd4 12. Re1 Re8 {Let's skip the opening
and come to the important part of the game. Until this point both sides had
played quite quickly. But here Magnus sunk into a deep think. And how deep was
it? 40 minutes in all! So what exactly was going through his mind? It is clear
that White has the bishop pair. But the knight on d4 is strongly placed.
Important is not to let Black establish the knight on d4 with the move c5.
Black wants to play c5 and to dxc6 take with bxc6, when he can strengthen his
knight with c5. Here Magnus came up with a deep idea to put his rook on e4
followed by pushing his h-pawn down the board. Quite original. For normal
players like me the move Bd2 followed by Bc3 looks natural, but of course it is
no where close to as ambitious as what Magnus goes for.} 13. Re4 $5 { The funny
thing is that this move has already been played twice by the great player
Aleksander Wojtkiewicz.} (13. Bd2 c5 14. dxc6 bxc6 15. Bc3 c5 $11 { is some
sort of a dream scenario for Black.}) (13. Be3 Nf5 14. Bc1 c6 $11) 13... c5 14.

fear his rook getting trapped in the centre of the board.} f5 (20... Bh8 21.

least temporarily closing the g2 bishop.} 24. Qxf4 Qc5 25. Qd2 $16 {[%cal

Qc5 26. Ba1 $1 {The queen is coming to b2 and there would be no way to avert
the mate.} d5 27. Rc1 $1 {Daniil Yuffa found it futile to continue the
resistance. The main point is that after the queen moves Bxe4 follows and then
Qc3 mates the black king on the long diagonal. A beautiful game by Carlsen.
Particularly impressive was his idea of Re4 followed by h4, which he found over
the board.} (27. Rc1 Qd6 28. Bxe4 fxe4 29. Qd4 Kf7 30. Qh8 $18) 1-0
