Nc3 Nc6 6. Nf3 Bg4 {This is one of the main positions in the Panov Botvinnik Variation of the Caro Kann. Nearly 3800 games have been played here. But now Kosteniuk chooses a move that has only been played in eight games!} 7. Bg5 {The main game in which this was played was in Aronian-Grischuk in Sinquefield Cup.} Ne4 8. Be3 (8. cxd5 Nxg5 9. dxc6 bxc6 10. Be2 Nxf3+ 11. Bxf3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Rc8 $11 {leads to a round about equal position.}) 8... e6 9. cxd5 Nxc3 10. bxc3 Qxd5 11. Be2 Be7 12. O-O O-O { This position looks to have arisen out of the c3 Sicilian more than the Caro Kann.} 13. h3 Bxf3 $6 {A pretty dubious decision giving up the two bishops. After this White has a clear edge.} (13... Bf5 $11) 14. Bxf3 $14 Qd7 15. Qa4 Rfd8 16. Rab1 Ne5 $5 17. Bd1 $1 Nc6 18. Qb5 b6 19. Ba4 {White has definite pressure here.} Rac8 20. c4 Qc7 {Threatening the d4 pawn.} 21. Rfd1 g6 $6 { If Anna would have asked herself what is my opponent's plan she would have realized that it is highly imperative to do something against c4-c5.} (21... e5 $1 22. d5 Nd4 23. Bxd4 exd4 24. Rxd4 Qe5 $44 {White might be slightle better but Black has excellent compensation on the dark squares.}) 22. c5 $1 $16 { Lagno is alert and takes her chance. This is a strong move trying to get the rooks into the game.} bxc5 23. dxc5 Rd5 (23... Rxd1+ 24. Rxd1 Bf8 25. g3 $16 { Black is tied down while White can slowly improve her position.}) 24. Qa6 Nb8 25. Qb7 Rxd1+ 26. Bxd1 Nd7 27. c6 Nc5 (27... Qxc6 28. Qxc6 Rxc6 29. Rb7 Rd6 30. Ba4 $18) 28. Qxc7 Rxc7 29. Bf3 $18 {The two bishops combined with the c-pawn are a winning force. It is surprising how everything went downhill for Anna in a matter of few moves.} Bd6 30. Rd1 Be7 31. Bf4 Rc8 32. c7 Bf6 33. Rb1 1-0
