{One of the key games of round 7 was this encounter, where Black escaped a
solid opening that looked very difficult to win, and did so anyway.} 1. d4 d5

to try and eliminate all risk of losing.} Bxd3 6. Qxd3 c6 7. O-O Bd6 8. Nbd2

without making pawn-structure concessions, and to fight for the e5-square. For
instance:} 10. Bg3 Nbd7 11. Rfe1 Re8 12. e4 {White should get this in before
Black plays ...e5.} dxe4 13. Nxe4 Nxe4 14. Qxe4 a5 $132 {with a position type
often seen in the Caro-Kann, for instance an Inarkiev-Ding game (venue slips
my mind.)}) 10. exf4 Nbd7 11. Rfe1 Qb6 12. Rab1 Rfe8 13. Ne5 {White's position
is a lot easier to play, though it is not better. He may also want b4 so Black
hurries:} c5 (13... a5 14. Ndf3 {will force a decision anyway due to the ideas
of Ng5 and f5}) 14. Ndf3 cxd4 15. Qxd4 Qxd4 16. Nxd4 a6 {The position type has
now changed- a good transformation from Black's perspective, though the
evaluation is the same.} 17. f3 Rac8 18. g4 {Trying to keep the heat on.} (18.

to look. The fact that he tried for more could have caused him a little
trouble.} 21. Rbe1 Nc6 22. Nxc6 Rxc6 23. f5 g6 $11) 21. Rd1 Na4 22. Kf2 $6 {
A little bit slow.} (22. Rde1 $5 Nc5 23. f5 {is most exacting:} Nd3 24. Rd1 Nf4

Rxe6 (reminiscent of the L'Ami game from r4.)}) 22... g6 23. Rd3 Nb6 24. b3 $6

White isn't managing to attack his targets properly and can easily become worse

easier for White.} Ke6 33. c4 Ng6 (33... Rcd8 34. Nc3 Ng6 35. Rg5 Rh8 $1 {
was the correct approach.}) 34. Rg5 b5 (34... Red8 35. Nc3 $14 {is similar}) (

here}) 41. c5 Ke7 {Now Black gets active again, but White can still control it:
