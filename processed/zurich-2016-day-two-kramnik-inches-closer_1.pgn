O-O 9. Re1 Nh5 10. Nf1 f5 11. Ng3 fxe4 12. Bb3+ Kh8 13. Ng5 $5 {going for
complications!} (13. Nxe4 {was perfectly possible}) 13... Nf4 {there wasn't
much of a choice} 14. Nf7+ Rxf7 15. Bxf7 Qf8 16. Bb3 exd3 {White is up the
exchange for now, but Black has two pawns (though d3 looks kind of weak) and
some activity. It's hard to say who I would rather be, even with the help of
computers.} 17. Bc4 d5 18. Bxd3 e4 (18... Be6 {keeps more compensation}) 19.
Bf1 (19. Bc2 Be6 20. Nxe4 $1 {is a strong tactical point the players might have
missed}) 19... g5 20. c4 dxc4 21. Nxe4 Ne5 22. Bxf4 gxf4 23. Ng5 (23. f3 $5)
23... Bf5 24. Qd5 c6 25. Qa5 {Somehow I don't believe much in this queen
maneuver all the way to a5.} b5 26. Rad1 Qe7 27. Ne4 Rg8 {Black's pieces are
swarmin the kingside and Anand needs to find a way to defend quickly.} 28. Nd6
$6 {This loses an exchange} Bc2 29. Qd2 (29. Rd2 Nf3+ 30. gxf3 Bd4+ 31. Kh1
Qxe1 {collects the house}) 29... Bxd1 30. Qxd1 Rf8 31. Ne4 f3 32. g3 Rd8 33.
Qc1 Nd3 $6 {a bit rushed, Black could have kept the pawn and the pressure with
other moves, such as Qe6.} 34. Bxd3 cxd3 35. Qxc6 Bxb2 36. Kf1 Qd7 37. Qxd7
Rxd7 38. Rd1 {Black is winning here, but it requires some technique} Rd5 (38...
b4 $1 39. Ng5 (39. Nc5 Rd5 40. Nxd3 Bc3 {is a permanent tpin as if White plays}
41. Nb2 Ra5 {is decisive.}) 39... a5 40. Nxf3 a4 41. Nd2 Rc7 {(other moves work
too) and Black should be winning. The threat is b3 and a3.}) 39. Nd2 b4 40.
Nxf3 Bc3 41. Ne1 d2 42. Nf3 Ra5 43. Nxd2 Rxa2 44. Ne4 {Unforunately for Shirov
this approach was too slow. White has sufficient counterplay here.} a5 45. Nxc3
