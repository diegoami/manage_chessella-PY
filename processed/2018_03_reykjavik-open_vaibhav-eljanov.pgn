1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {It has become rare these days to allow the
Nimzo-Indian, mostly because Black gets the choice between equalising
reasonably comfortably and going for some adventures. Needing a win to secure
a meaningful prize, Eljanov is going for the latter.} 4. Qc2 O-O 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6.
Qxc3 d6 7. g3 Bd7 $5 {A slightly adventurous move.} (7... e5 8. dxe5 dxe5 9.
Bg2 Re8 {is fairly solid equality, e.g.} 10. Nf3 Nc6 11. Be3 a5 12. O-O Qe7 $11
{Maiorov,N-Zhigalko,S Minsk 2015}) 8. Bg2 Bc6 9. f3 {An ambitious move in
reply and quite likely preparation.} (9. Nf3 {has been almost exclusively
played. If White had prepared particularly industriously, he would have noted
that Eljanov has a previous game in this line:} Nbd7 10. O-O Be4 11. b3 Qe7 12.
a4 a5 13. Re1 b6 $11 {Kulaots,K-Eljanov,P Konya 2011}) 9... d5 10. Nh3 (10. b3
{is not bad, but it is rather unnecessary, especially if one thinks Black is
unlikely to capture on c4.}) 10... b6 (10... dxc4 11. e4 $44 {could be hard to
go into without preparation: White is just playing Nf2, Be3, etc. on the next
few moves and when the time is right he will formalise the gambit with b3.})
11. O-O (11. cxd5 {could have been played one move earlier, because now Black
is discouraged from taking back with the pawn.} Nxd5 (11... exd5 12. Bf4 $1 $16
{is a nasty bind}) 12. Qc2 Ne7 13. e3 Bb5 $5 14. Ng5 g6 15. Bd2 $14) 11... Bb7
12. cxd5 exd5 13. Bf4 c5 $1 {Black finds a creative path to trick his way out
of jail.} (13... Na6 14. b4 $16 {or something is just a world of pain}) 14.
dxc5 d4 15. Qc2 Na6 $1 16. c6 (16. cxb6 Qxb6 {offers Black tremendous
compensation thanks to his better minor pieces, e.g.} 17. Kh1 Nc5 18. b4 Ne6
$44) (16. Bd6 Re8 17. b4 Nd5 18. Qd3 $1 $14 {was the accurate way to retain a
plus for White}) 16... Rc8 17. Rad1 Rxc6 18. Qa4 {At first (and even for a few
more moves) it looks like White has accomplished something, whereas in truth
this is probably not the case.} Qe7 19. Qxd4 (19. Rfe1 Re6 {must have been
something White looked at, but there is simply no way to keep a clean pawn:}
20. Rd2 (20. Kf2 d3 $1 $15) (20. Bf1 d3 21. e4 Nc5 22. Qb4 Rd8 $132) 20... Rd8
21. Qd1 (21. Ng5 Red6 $3 $11) 21... Rd7 22. Ng5 $1 $14 {In this way, White
gets an edge, even if not a pawn.}) 19... Qxe2 20. Rfe1 Qc2 {It is hard to
believe, but White's advantage is on the verge of evaporating here. Black has
all kinds of tricky and dynamic ideas, mostly on the light squares, and can be
happy that the g2-bishop is completely blocked in.} 21. Re7 ({For instance,} 
21. Be5 Nc5 22. Nf4 Ne6 $132 {and the best White can aspire to are various
endings featuring the bishop pair against a bishop and knight.}) (21. b4 Nc7
22. Be5 Nb5 $132 {also does not really help}) 21... Nc5 22. Qd2 {Dodging ...
Ne6 with gain of tempo.} Qa4 ({However, the importance of the tempo is not
totally clear, as} 22... Qxd2 {looks playable too.} 23. Rxd2 Re6 $1 24. Rxe6
Nxe6 25. Be5 Rd8 26. Rxd8+ Nxd8 27. Bxf6 gxf6 {and White has a largely
symbolic advantage.}) 23. b4 Ncd7 $6 (23... Re6 $132 {saved Black needless
material loss}) 24. Ng5 $6 ({It is not clear why White didn't take the offered
material:} 24. Rxd7 Nxd7 25. Qxd7 Bc8 26. Qd4 $16 {and Black is in dire
straits.}) 24... Rc2 25. Qe1 Qxa3 $1 (25... h6 {is tempting, trying to stretch
out White's inter-piece communications in this already very ill-defined
position; however it transpires that} 26. Ne6 $1 $14 {works for White.}) 26.
Ne4 (26. Rdxd7 Nxd7 27. Rxd7 Bc6 28. Rd6 Re8 $44 {gives Black amazing play for
this smallest of material deficits, but objectively White should still have
done this.}) 26... Bc6 27. Nf2 Nd5 $6 {Once more Black offers the two knights
for a rook!} (27... a5 {was possible, and Black has an extra pawn as well as
better co-ordination. Nevertheless, for tactical reasons White may continue:}
28. Bd6 Qc3 29. Qxc3 Rxc3 30. bxa5 bxa5 31. Ne4 Nxe4 32. fxe4 Nf6 $15 {keeping
his disadvantage to an absolute minimum.}) 28. Rxd5 Bxd5 29. Rxd7 Bc6 30. Rd3 (
30. Rc7 $1 $14 {gave White an advantage, but it is hard to imagine it being
advantageous to leave the 2nd rank bare. The idea is} Qa2 31. Bf1 $1 {and
Black lacks a convincing follow-up.}) 30... Qa2 31. Rd2 Re8 32. Ne4 $1 (32. Qd1
$6 Rxd2 {is the point, and White's bishop runs into tactical trouble.} 33. Bxd2
$1 (33. Qxd2 $2 Qxd2 34. Bxd2 Re2 35. Bc3 Rc2 $17) 33... Rd8 34. Qc1 Bxf3 35.
Bxf3 Qxd2 $15 {White faces an uphill struggle to maintain the balance.}) 32...
f5 33. Qd1 Rxd2 34. Nxd2 a5 (34... Qb2 $1 {forces the queen exchange on pain
of losing the b4-pawn.}) 35. Bf1 $1 {Now White is co-ordinated but in the time
scramble, anything can happen and it is hard to fault anyone for swings within
about half a pawn.} Bd5 36. bxa5 bxa5 37. Bd3 (37. Bb5 $1 $16 {is the only
move to fully show the requisite urgency.}) 37... a4 38. Bxf5 a3 39. Qa4 ({
According to the omniscient machine,} 39. Be4 Bxe4 40. Nxe4 $11 {was just
about fine, as Black has no way to shepherd the a-pawn home without running
into some knight trick or mating attack.}) 39... Bf7 40. Qd4 Qb2 ({After many
moves of an insanely complex game, there is finally a winning chance, and of
course it occurs on move 40.} 40... Qd5 $1 41. Qc3 (41. Qxd5 Bxd5 {and the
pawn runs unstoppably- note} 42. Bb1 Re1+ 43. Kf2 Rxb1 $19) 41... Qxf5 42. Qxa3
Qb5 $17 {and Black should really convert this}) 41. Qxb2 axb2 42. Kf2 Bg6 {
Contrary to initial impressions, Black is unable to demand the price of a
straight piece for the b-pawn.} 43. Bxg6 hxg6 44. Nb1 Rc8 45. Be5 Rc2+ $1 {
A nice winning attempt.} (45... Rc1 46. Na3 b1=Q 47. Nxb1 Rxb1 $11 {is not
even worth trying to win}) 46. Ke3 Rxh2 47. Kd3 g5 48. Kc3 Kf7 49. Bd4 Rg2 50.
g4 Rg3 51. Kxb2 Rxf3 52. Nd2 Rd3 $6 {Not a great move. Thankfully, he lives to
tell the tale anyway.} (52... Rf4 {would presumably have been Black's choice,
had he realised that the game continuation does not actually guarantee the win
of White's last pawn. White has to put in a token amount of effort to hold the
draw here.} 53. Kc3 Rxg4 54. Kd3 g6 55. Nf3 Ke6 56. Ne5 $11) 53. Bc3 Rg3 54.

61. Nd1 Rg2 62. Nf2 Rg3 63. Bd2 Ke5 64. Ke2 Ke6 {White has successfully
consolidated. He can take the g5-pawn on demand, but presumably he wanted to
stretch out the game to as many separate chunks of 50 moves as possible.} 65.

g5 {We have now reached essentially the endgame from my game against Greek GM
Spyridon Skembris from Bad Woerishofen 2014. Having defended that by the skin
on my teeth, I can assure you that White's winning ideas are no joke. However,
it would have been unfair of Caissa to award White the full point here, and so
she didn't.} Ra4 92. Ne5 Ra1 93. Bd2 Kg7 94. Ke4 Rd1 95. Bc3 Kh7 96. Bd4 Rd2

the key idea, which is to always either give check or keep something pinned.}
