1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. h3 {Fashionable. I
remember when I was in my early 20s, 6.Be3 was the predominent continuation.
What has remained the same since then is the fact that regardless of what is
the most fashionable continuation, Gelfand is still one of the leaders in
Najdorf theory!} e6 {This time, Gelfand adapts a "Scheveningen" type position.}

himself drew two games against Bukavshin and Swiercz.} b5 9. Nd5 Nbd7 10. Nec3

g4 Be7 8. g5 Nfd7 9. h4 b5 {The most principled and popular. Black is planning
to push white's knight back with b4. In the mean time he will have his bishop
on b7 which will exert pressure on white's central pawn on e4.} (9... Nc6 10.

possibility. ½-½ (41) Anand,V (2803)-Salem,A (2624) Berlin 2015}) 10. a3 Bb7
11. Be3 Nc6 12. Qd2 {Both parties are developing their pieces in the most
accurate way. There have been many games in this position!} Rc8 {The most
principled. Gelfand is a classical player with a great sense for Sicillian.
Here his rook on c8 will have an eye on thematic exchange sacrifice on c3.} 13.
Rh3 {[#] Flamboyant. Nxc6 is the move which has been played more than a dozen
of times.White tries to get his rook out of a8-h1 diagonal's X-ray and covers
f3 square to avoid tactical blows if black knight lands on e5. Nevertheless,
the rest of the game shows that this was merely a home preparation by
Demchenko. He must have relied on the beautiful victory of Areshchenko in this
line.} b4 $146 {Another alternative could be the knight's move with the idea
of occupying the c4 square.} (13... O-O 14. O-O-O Re8 15. Kb1 Bf8 16. h5 Nde5
