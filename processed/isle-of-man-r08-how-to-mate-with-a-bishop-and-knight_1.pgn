But then slowed down a bit. But the way he won this game was quite excellent.} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7 7. Nf3 {Shirov doesn't go for the sharpest lines beginning with Qg4.} Qa5 8. Bd2 Nbc6 9. a4 Bd7 10. Bb5 a6 11. Bd3 c4 12. Be2 { The queenside is now closed. White has a clear plan of attack on the kingside with f4-f5. Hence, Black will castle queenside. Yet White will have to go for f4-f5 because that is the only active plan he has in the position. Because White's king will be on that wing, the position will become quite sharp. But, it will take several moves as the position is closed and a tempo doesn't really matter.} h6 13. O-O O-O-O 14. Bc1 Kb8 (14... Qxc3 15. Bd2 $18) 15. Ba3 Nc8 (15... Qxc3 16. a5 $5 Nf5 17. Bc5 $44) 16. Qd2 Ka8 17. Nh4 Rdg8 (17... g5 18. Nf3 {Later the knight will move and f4 will come in, when Black would either have to allow f5 or after gxf4, the f7 point would be weak.}) 18. g3 Nb8 19. f4 g6 20. Ng2 Bc6 21. Ne3 Nd7 22. Bf3 Qc7 23. a5 h5 {Black has built up some sort of a fortress which prevents White from expanding on the kingside. However, it is not so easy to stop Shirov!} (23... Qxa5 {This is a pawn you don't usually touch. White will be able to sacrifice something soon and open lines against the black king.}) 24. Bb4 Rd8 25. Qg2 Nb8 26. Rfb1 h4 {Maybe Harika could have just waited and seen what Shirov would do. But it is not such a tempting option. She advances her h-pawn, but after g4, the idea of f5 once again becomes possible.} 27. g4 f6 28. Rf1 g5 $6 29. f5 $1 {This is exactly what White needed. The position opens up and his pieces are excellently placed.} fxe5 30. fxe6 e4 31. Bxe4 $1 (31. Be2 $18 {was also strong.}) 31... h3 32. Qe2 dxe4 33. Rf7 {The queen on c7 is trapped!} Nd7 34.

His pieces are excellently placed, especially the knight on e3 is just perfect!} Qc8 41. c4 Qb8 42. c3 Rg8 43. d5 Ba4 44. Rf7 Rc8 45. Qb6 Rf8 46. Rc7 Rf3 47. d6 Bc6 48. d7 Rf8 49. Qc5 Bxd7 50.
