1. c4 {[%emt 0:00:00] Aronian begins with a move that gives him flexibility, an
ability to play the English or 1.d4 lines.} Nf6  2. Nc3  e6 {[%emt 0:00:06]
Ding Liren keeps it simple. He plays it solid. Of course he knows that he can
expect the Mikenas variation.} 3. e4 { [%emt 0:00:03] Levon has played this
move nine times in the past. I am sure Ding Liren expected it and had prepared
against it.} d5  4. cxd5  (4. e5 d4 {When White has not exchanged on d5, then
e5 should be met with d4.}) 4... exd5  5. e5 {[%emt 0:00:09] When White has
taken on d5 and then played e5, then d4 is not such a great move. Black must
play Ne4.} Ne4  (5... d4 6. exf6 dxc3 7. Bb5+ $1 c6 8. Qe2+ Be6 9. Bc4 cxd2+
10. Bxd2 Qxf6 11. Nf3 $44 {And White has excellent compensation for the pawn.})
6. Nf3  (6. Nxe4 dxe4 7. Qa4+ Nc6 8. Qxe4 Qd4 $44 {is excellent compensation
for Black.}) 6... Bf5  7. Be2  d4 $5 {[%emt 0:01:10] This move is much more
forcing and limits White's options. It has been seen only twice. Once in the
game between Topalov and Nakamura in Paris GCT in 2017 and the other between
Shimanov and Ju Wenjun just ten days ago. It is very interesting to note that
the move 6.b3 that was played by Ding Liren against Wesley So is also a line
that is the favourite to Ju Wenjun!} (7... Nc6 8. O-O {has been seen in six
game before.}) 8. Nxe4  Bxe4  9. Bc4 {[%emt 0: 00:57] White puts his bishop on
an active square, threatens to play Qb3 at some point and also to get in d3,
when the bishop on won't be stuck on e2 like in the game Topalov-Nakamura.} (9.
d3 {was Topalov's move, but after} Bd5 10. O-O (10. Qa4+ Nc6 $15) 10... Nc6 $11
{Black had a fine playable position.}) 9... Bd5 $1 {[%emt 0:03:29] The bishop
on c4 is strong and it makes sense to exchange it.} 10. Qb3  Bxc4  11. Qxc4 
Nc6 {[%emt 0:00:13] Already Black seems to have a completely fine position.}
12. O-O  Qd7  13. d3  Qe6 $1 {[%emt 0:03:18] Black's strategy is pretty simple,
exchange all of White's pieces that are active. He did so with the bishop on c4
and now he does it with the queen.} (13... Be7 14. Bf4 O-O 15. Rac1 $14) (13...
O-O-O { After the game Aronian said that even this move seems to be fine.}) 14.
Qxe6+  (14. Qa4 Rd8 $11) 14... fxe6  15. Ng5 $5 { [%emt 0:01:03] According to
Ding Liren, this was a good idea by Aronian to snatch the initiative, rerouting
the knight to e4 and bolstering the centre with f4.} Kd7  (15... Nxe5 $5 16.
Nxe6 Kf7 17. Nxc7 (17. Nxd4 Rd8 18. Be3 c5 19. Nb3 Nxd3 $11) 17... Rc8 18. Nd5
Bd6 $15) 16. f4  Be7  17. Ne4  Raf8 {[%emt 0:18:15] Aronian didn't like this
idea followed by g5 for his opponent. He felt that it was better to go Nb4 and
bolstering the centre with c5 (just like Aronian did with Ng5 and f4). But I
don't think Ding Liren's idea is bad.} (17... Nb4 $5 18. a3 $5 (18. Rf3 c5 $11)
18... Nxd3 19. Rd1 Nc5 20. Rxd4+ Kc8 21. Rc4 Nxe4 22. Rxe4 $11) 18. Bd2  g5 $1
{[%emt 0:02:21] Very thematic, chipping away at the white centre.} 19. g3  (19.
fxg5 Nxe5 $15) 19... Rhg8  20. Kh1  gxf4  21. gxf4  Rg6  22. Rac1  Rfg8  (22...
a5 {stopping b4 could have been a good idea, as White doesn't have to prepare
that move.}) 23. a3  (23. b4 {was a move that could have been played directly.}
a6 24. Rc4 $14) 23... a5  24. Rf3  b6  25. Rh3  R8g7  26. Ng3  Nd8  27. b4 
(27. f5 exf5 28. Nxf5 Rf7 29. Nxd4 c5 30. Nb5 Ne6 $44 {gives Black ample of
compensation for the pawn.}) 27... axb4  28. axb4  b5 {[%emt 0:03:35] Ding
Liren was not too happy that his knight didn't have a good square in the game.
When Aronian played b4, Ding finally felt that his knight had found its home on
c6 to attack the b4 pawn. For that he had to fix it and hence, he went for b5.
But it turns out that White has some interesting ideas based on the move f5.}
29. Kg2 $6 {[%emt 0:06: 54] I was sitting in the press room and there were some
really strong players there. Most notably Gaprindashvili, Ioseliani, Sosonko
etc. and they all were wondering why Aronian didn't play f5. It's of course
easy to assume that both the players had seen this move and it was confirmed by
them in the post game comments. However, the computer remains unimpressed. This
proves the point that what the silicon monster thinks is the best, is often the
critical line of humans, but they refrain from it because of tremendous
complexity.} (29. f5 $5 exf5 30. Nxf5 Rf7 31. Nxd4 {This is all forced. Now
Black has some options.} Rg4 {was Aronian's main line.} (31... c5 $6 32. bxc5
Bxc5 33. Nxb5 $18) (31... Ne6 {was considered by Ding Liren.} 32. Nxb5 c6 $6
(32... Rg4 $5 {seems like a better move, which transposes to Aronian's line.})
33. Na3 $1 $16) 32. Nxb5 Ne6 {This seems like the best line and even though
White is two pawns up, I still feel that the position is not so easy to handle
as Black's pieces are very active.} 33. d4 c6 34. Ra3 $5 {This was the move
that Levon was calculating during the game.} cxb5 35. d5 {And it seems really
dangerous for Black, but he has the only way to maintain the balance.} Rf2 $1
36. Ra7+ Ke8 37. Be3 Re2 38. dxe6 Rxe3 39. Ra8+ (39. Rc8+ Bd8 $19) 39... Bd8
40. Rd1 Ke7 41. Raxd8 Kxe6 $11) 29... Nc6 {[%emt 0:00:35] Now the b4 pawn is
under pressure.} 30. Rb1  Rf7  31. Rh5  Rg8  32. Rh6  (32. Kf3 Ra8 {with rook
coming to a2, White has to be careful.} 33. Rb2 Ra4 34. Ke4 Bxb4 35. Bxb4 Nxb4
36. f5 $13) 32... Bf8  33. Rh3  Be7  34. Rh6  Bf8  35. Rh3  Be7 {[%emt 0:00:27]
And the players agreed to a draw. One can say nothing much happened in this
game, but I would say, it was a moral victory for the Chinese player who was
able to draw the game without too many difficulties with the black pieces.}
1/2-1/2
