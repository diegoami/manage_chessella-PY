Bb5+ c6 9. Ng5 O-O 10. Be2 Bxe2 11. Nxe2 c5 $5 {[#] Kulaots was leading the
tournament by half a point and he was playing with Black but he is not content
with defending but tries to seize the initiative by sacrificing a pawn in the
opening. No matter how good this move is theoritically, from a practical point
of view it was a good decision because Iturrizaga now went into the tank and
thought for 30 minutes. It should be noted that ...c5 had already been played
by Gr√ºnfeld-experts such as Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and David Navara. However,
it seems as if Iturrizaga was caught by surprise. Which shows that
grandmasters are human and do not prepare everything.} 12. dxc5 N6d7 13. Qa3 {

text-move 13.Qa3 had been tried only once before and therefore Kulaots is no
longer following theory.} 13... Na6 (13... h6 14. Nf3 Nc6 15. O-O b6 16. Be3

his extra-pawn. Black's compensation is very dynamic and mainly due to Black's
lead in development. But if White has time to consolidate Black will easily
wind up in a bad endgame.} 18. b3 {[#]} Rxe3 $1 {Kulaots does not want to
defend an endgame but prefers to give the exchange for dynamic play.} 19. fxe3

in motion. The game gets more and more dramatic.} fxg5 22. hxg5 Bxg5 23. b5 {

True, the knight is on the rim but it troubles the black king somewhat.
