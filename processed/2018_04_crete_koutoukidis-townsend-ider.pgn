1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. exd5 {Not trying to prove any opening
advantage outright, just claiming to be a better player.} exd5 5. Bd3 {If one
is playing this line one may as well try and pretend to play against the
c8-bishop...} Nf6 ({My single experience with this position continued:} 5...
Ne7 6. Qh5 Nbc6 7. Nge2 Be6 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 Qd7 10. Ng3 {and while I had
successfully neutralised the idea of ...Bf5 for a while to come, Black's
Nimzo-type nonchalance towards my posession of the bishop pair ultimately
resulted in real counterplay and a full point: Fernandez,D-Medina,W Jakarta
2013}) 6. Nge2 Nc6 7. O-O O-O 8. Bg5 Be7 ({I am finding it a bit hard to
decide whether} 8... Bxc3 $5 {also equalises. If it does, then it is much more
logical to me.} 9. Nxc3 h6 10. Bxf6 (10. Be3 Nb4 11. Be2 Bf5 12. Rc1 Re8 13. a3
Nc6 $11) 10... Qxf6 11. Nxd5 Qd6 12. Be4 Re8 13. Bf3 (13. Qd3 $5 Be6 14. Qg3

c6 $11) 15... Rad8 $14 {Black isn't regaining the pawn by force, but White's
pieces are tied up in quite an awkward way. Nevertheless, this still doesn't
look like completely full compensation.}) 9. Qd2 (9. a3 {seems more accurate,
because of the next note. If White gives up one bishop for a knight, it should
probably be the one on g5.}) 9... Re8 (9... Nb4 {would be automatic for me.}
10. Ng3 Nxd3 11. Qxd3 c6 $11 {and now White has to be slightly cautious not to
end up worse in the next few moves, which a careless man could do, for
instance by} 12. Nce2 $6 Re8 13. Rfe1 h6 14. Bd2 Qb6 15. Rab1 c5 $1 $15) 10. a3
Na5 {With this and the next few moves Black drifts a little bit. This is
especially true since I don't believe ...Nc4 was ever a genuinely desirable
thing for him.} 11. b3 (11. Nf4 c6 12. Rfe1 $14 {is also surprisingly
uncomfortable.}) 11... b6 12. Rfe1 c6 13. Ng3 Nb7 $2 {Even if Black had time
for ...Nd6 his position would still be slightly worse, in a 'cramped Petroff'
kind of way. However, there is a more immediate tactical issue, and one which
I am impressed with the White player for pointing out.} (13... g6 14. Re2 Nb7
15. Rae1 Nd6 $14 {is close to being an exact transposition to a Petroff with 6.
..Nd6.}) 14. Rxe7 $3 Qxe7 $2 (14... Rxe7 15. Bxf6 gxf6 16. Nh5 Qf8 {was how I
expected Black to defend, and this would keep three results on the table due
to the accuracy White needs.} 17. Nxf6+ Kh8 18. Nxh7 Qg7 19. Qf4 Re6 $1 20. Ne2

the towel, though the technical phase took a while.} 16. Bxe7 Rxe7 17. Re1 $18
