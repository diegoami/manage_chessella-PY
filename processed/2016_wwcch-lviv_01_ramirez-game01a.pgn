1. e4 {[%emt 0:00:00]} e5 $5 {[%emt 0:00:00] An interesting move, right from
the get-go! Hou Yifan has never played 1...e5 against 1.e4 in her career, at
least according to the 2016 MegaBase. This must've come as a surprise to
Mariya, and although she replied relatively quickly, it took her some time to
figure out exactly what to play.} 2. Nf3 {[%emt 0:00:00]} Nc6 {[%emt 0:00:00]}

Y (2673)-Eljanov,P (2760) Wijk aan Zee 2016}) 7... h6 {[%emt 0:04:00] The
Italian game has a lot of subleties that differentiate the different
move-orders, such as playing 7... h6, a6 or something else first. This is not
the time or place to discuss all of them, but the reader should be aware that
these moves are not as straight-forward or interchangeable as they seem.} ({
For example} 7... a6 {threatens to trap the bishop on c4 with 8...Na5, and
must be defended against if White wants to somehow retain an advantage.}) 8.
Re1 {[%emt 0:02:06]} a6 {[%emt 0:01:32]} 9. a4 {[%emt 0:01:02]} Ba7 {[%emt 0:
05:47]} 10. Nbd2 {[%emt 0:01:45]} Re8 {[%emt 0:04:10] Already this position
has never been reached in top level chess. The position is quite typical,
though, and the plans and maneuvers are well known. Amon others, White can
play Nf1-g3-f5, or expand on the queenside with b4 at some point. Black
retains a solid position, tries to trade some pieces and push d5 when
appropiate.} 11. Nf1 {[%emt 0:01:12]} Be6 {[%emt 0:05:20]} 12. Bxe6 {[%emt 0:
02:37]} Rxe6 {[%emt 0:00:06]} 13. Be3 {[%emt 0:03:08]} Bxe3 {[%emt 0:09:38]}
14. Nxe3 {[%emt 0:00:43]} d5 {[%emt 0:00:06] It's hard to believe that White
retains any real edge in this position. Black has managed to grab a
significant amount of space in the center and with the trade of bishops it
doesn't seem like White can accomplish very much.} 15. Qc2 {[%emt 0:07:40]} Qd7
{[%emt 0:04:44]} 16. Rad1 {[%emt 0:06:03]} (16. b4 Ne7 {Doesn't look nearly as
good to me as the computer is claiming, which is still not much (+0.24 or
something along those lines, it just lookes equal to me).}) 16... Rd8 {[%emt 0:
06:28]} 17. Nf5 {[%emt 0:02:45]} Qe8 {[%emt 0:08:26] Among other things, this
move really challenges Mariya to go for it. In a match setting, having a draw
with Black is an excellent start, and Hou Yifan is happy sitting back and
defending.} 18. b4 {[%emt 0:10:55]} b5 {[%emt 0:08:54]} 19. axb5 {[%emt 0:13:
23]} axb5 {[%emt 0:00:05]} 20. Nd2 {[%emt 0:00:57] Trying to exploit the
weakness left by the move b5: c5. However the maneuver is not on time to
create any problems.} Ne7 {[%emt 0:09:51]} 21. Nxe7+ {[%emt 0:05:37]} Qxe7 {
[%emt 0:00:22]} 22. Nb3 {[%emt 0:00:22]} dxe4 {[%emt 0:05:51]} 23. dxe4 {
[%emt 0:00:23]} Red6 {[%emt 0:00:17] With everything coming off the board the
draw seems inevitable.} 24. Nc5 {[%emt 0:01:33]} Rxd1 {[%emt 0:02:35]} 25. Rxd1

[%emt 0:00:11]} Qd6 {[%emt 0:00:38]} 31. Qe3 {[%emt 0:01:35] A solid start for
the challenger. She was not afraid to try a new opening and surprise her
oponent. She held the draw very comfortably, and now it will be her turn to
push against Muzychuk's black.} 1/2-1/2
