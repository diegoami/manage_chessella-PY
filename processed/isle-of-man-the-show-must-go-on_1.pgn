played by Jussupow on a couple of occasions. Objectively speaking, Black is
just worse, but he's still in the game.}) 16. d5 exd5 17. e5 {was the famous
game Polugaevsky-Tal, 1969.}) (11... Nd7 12. O-O b6 {is what Kramnik has been
playing with some degree of success, but even the mighty Vlad had a hard time
defending against Carlsen (twice in 2016) and Aronian (earlier this year).})

chance to transpose.}) 12... Ba6 13. Bxa6 Nxa6 14. d6 Nc5 15. e5 {[#] Who wants
to play this position with Black?} Qd7 ({I don't know if Mecking got this far
