        {[#]} Na7 $1 {[%csl Gb5,Gc6][%cal Ge8c6,Ga7b5] You can bank on Michael 
        Adams to find the most accurate way to equalize the game. The knight frees 
        the c6 square for the e8 bishop, while at the same time it is also threaning 
        to come to b5 with a tempo.} 22. a4 Qd6 23. Nc4 Qe7 24. Nb6 Qd6 25. Nc4

        But on close inspection you realize that Black is completely fine and 
        the position is just equal.} 1/2-1/2
