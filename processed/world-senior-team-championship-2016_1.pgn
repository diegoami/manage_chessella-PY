Nf3 g6 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 Bg7 4. g3 O-O 5. Bg2 d6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. O-O Rb8 8. h3 a6 9. e4 b5 10. cxb5 axb5 11. Re1 {A surprise for me in this well-known theoretical position. After the game my opponent told me that it was recommended by Avrukh. A database check shows that there were isolated games with this move as far back as the 1960s, but it is only recently that it has been played with any frequency.} b4 {This seemed the most natural move, although Mark Hebden pointed that there is a case for} (11... e6 {so that a subsequent ...b4 will push the knight to a less active square.}) 12. Nd5 Nd7 ( 12... Nxd5 13. exd5 Na7 {leaves White with doubled isolated pawns in the centre of the board, but unfortunately} 14. Qa4 {leaves Black without a natural reply.} Rb6 {is probably best, but as this allows White to force a draw by} 15. Qxa7 Ra6 16. Qb8 Rb6 17. Qa7 {I decided on another continuation.}) 13. Bg5 h6 14. Be3 {This has been played most often, but it is possible that} ( 14. Rc1 $5 hxg5 15. Rxc6 {is a more critical continuation, based on the tactical point} Bb7 16. Nxb4) 14... e6 15. Nf4 {White's minor pieces are massed on the kingside and given time he might be able to generate threats there, so Black needs to create counterplay as quickly as possible.} Na5 { Aiming for queenside play. It is also reasonable to play in the centre by} ( 15... e5 16. dxe5 Ncxe5 17. Nxe5 Nxe5 {with a roughly equal position.}) 16. Rc1 b3 {Otherwise White might play b3 himself, which would leave the a5-knight out of play.} 17. Qd2 $6 {This gains a tempo by attacking the knight, but the queen is vulnerable to knight attacks on d2.} (17. axb3 Nxb3 18. Rc3 Na5 19. Qc2 {was better, when White has pressure along the c-file to compensate for the isolated b-pawn.}) 17... c5 {Black already has at least equality. A particular problem for White is the long-term vulnerability of the b2-pawn, since if this disappears Black will immediately gain a far-advanced passed pawn.} 18. a3 (18. dxc5 {is well met by either} Nxc5 {or} (18... bxa2)) 18... Ba6 {Taking aim at the c4-square.} ({The attempt to win a piece by} 18... cxd4 19. Nxd4 e5 $4 {fails to} 20. Nde6 {and White wins}) 19. e5 $6 {An attempt to mix things up which backfires.} (19. Bf1 Bxf1 20. Rxf1 (20. Kxf1 cxd4 21. Nxd4 Nc5 {is excellent for Black}) {is more solid, but even here I slightly prefer Black after} 20... Nf6 21. e5 Ne4 22. Qe2 c4 {since White's bishop is becoming bad.}) 19... dxe5 $1 {Cutting through the complications with a simple line which guarantees Black a clear advantage.} (19... Nc4 20. Rxc4 Bxc4 21. exd6 { is unclear, while}) (19... cxd4 $2 20. Nxd4 Nxe5 21. Ndxe6 fxe6 22. Nxe6 Nac4 23. Qd5 {is probably good for White.}) 20. dxe5 Nxe5 21. Nxe5 Bxe5 22. Rxc5 Nc4 {A multi-purpose move which removes the knight from attack, defends the bishop and attacks White's queen.} 23. Qe2 $2 {Now Black wins. The only chance was to continue} (23. Qxd8 Rfxd8 24. Bf1 {but Black is still much better after} Nxe3 25. Bxa6 Bd4 26. Rb5 Rxb5 27. Bxb5 Nc2 28. Rb1 Ba7 {with ... Rd2 to come.}) 23... Nxe3 24. Qxa6 Bxf4 (24... Bd4 25. Rc6 Nxg2 26. Kxg2 Bxb2 {is also very strong, but I didn't want to allow a possible sacrifice on e6.}) 25. gxf4 Qd4 $1 (25... Nxg2 26. Kxg2 Qd4 27. Rc3 Qxf4 28. Ree3 {is far less clear.}) 26. Re5 ({Now} 26. Rc3 {fails to} Nd1 27. Rf3 Nxb2) ({White could have set a trap by} 26. Rc7 Nxg2 27. Kxg2 Qxb2 28. Rxe6 Qb1 29. Rf6 {but then} Qe4+ $1 ({the trap is} 29... b2 $4 {which even loses after} 30. Qc4 $1) 30. f3 Qb1 {wins; for example,} 31. Rc1 (31. Qc4 Qb2+ {wins a rook}) 31... Qa2+ 32. Kg3 Kh8 {and the advance of the b-pawn cannot be prevented.}) 26... Nxg2 27. Kxg2 Qxb2 {White has no real counterplay and the passed pawn is quickly decisive.} 28. h4 (28. Rxe6 fxe6 29. Rxe6 {is most simply met by} Rf7) 28... h5 29. R1e3 Qc2 30. Rb5 b2 31. Reb3 Qxb3 0-1
