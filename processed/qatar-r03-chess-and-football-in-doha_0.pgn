Bd3 f5 35. h4 g5 36. hxg5 hxg5 {Diagram [#]} 37. Kc3 {This position is
definitely slightly better for White. What are reasons for it? First of all
White's position looks very harmonius. His king sits perfectly on c3 defending
the b3 pawn and the b3-c4 duo are very strong. Add to the fact that a5 is weak
and if it falls White gets a double passer and you understand the difficulties
faced by Black. Also on the kingside the f5 pawn is a tad weak. All in all it
is a position where White can press without any danger of losing.} Kf6 38. Ra1

queenside for the time being, so he should shift his attention to the kingside
and break either with g4 after Be2 or f4.} 47. Be2 $1 (47. f4 $6 gxf4 48. gxf4

52. gxf5 Bxf5 53. Bd3 {is an endgame which Anish would have wanted to play. Of
course taking the bishop is possible, but the black king is cut off on the
third. It is not so clear whether the rook endgame is winning or not but it is
surely pleasant for White. On the other hand if the bishop is not taken then it
goes to e4 and White has definitely made some progress.} Bxd3 (53... Be6 54.
