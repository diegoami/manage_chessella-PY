1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 {Caruana successfully relied on the Queens Gambit Accepted
in his match with Grischuk in the Champions Showdown, St. Louis 2017.} 3. e3 {
The quietest line. White makes sure to get his pawn back.} ({Alexander focused
on} 3. e4) 3... Nf6 4. Bxc4 e6 5. Nf3 c5 6. O-O a6 7. Be2 $5 {Typical Magnus.
This move is way down the list of White's options.} Nbd7 {Caruana is careful to
sidestep Carlsen's preparation.} (7... cxd4 8. exd4 Nc6 9. Nc3 Be7 10. Be3 {
was seen in Aronian-Caruana, Sinquefield Cup 2017. While the position of Be2
doesn't lend a hand to White's usual attacking ambition on the K-side, he can
choose a different plan. Fabiano reacted quickly} Ng4 $5 ({not allowing White
to expand after} 10... O-O 11. Ne5) 11. Bf4 Nf6 {defended a slightly worse
position very successfully, and later took advantage of Levon's blunder. The
whole affair took 110 moves!}) 8. Nc3 {[#]} b6 $5 (8... b5 {seems obvious, but
therein lies the point of Carlsen's idea.} 9. e4 b4 10. e5 bxc3 11. exf6 Nxf6 (
{Much worse is} 11... cxb2 $6 12. fxg7 bxa1=Q $2 13. gxh8=Q {Same as in the
similar position of the Meran Variation, the four queens on the board make the
weak black king the decisive factor in the battle.}) 12. bxc3 {With his bishop
on e2, instead of d3, White is much better suited for subsequent play with Ne5
and Bf3.}) 9. e4 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Bb7 11. Be3 $5 {Still in Magnus's preparation.
Now he offers a pawn sac.} ({The immediate} 11. f3 {would have pointed Black
into the right direction:} Qb8 $1 12. Be3 Bd6 13. g3 h5 $5) 11... Bc5 {With
this move Caruana accepts a slightly worse position.} ({One wonders about}
11... Nxe4 12. Nxe4 Bxe4 13. Bf3 Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Bc5 {Clearly, White has some
play, but is it enough to claim an advantage? Practical testing is awaited.})
12. f3 $14 {[#] There are many classical examples, some from Kramnik's games,
of White benefiting from his g2-f3-e4 pawn chain. Black's Nf6 and Bb7 are
restricted.} O-O 13. Qe1 ({The more direct} 13. Qd2 Rc8 14. Na4 Be7 15. b4 b5
16. Nb2 {would leave Black searching for a suitable square for his queen, while
a2-a4 won't be long in coming.}) 13... Rc8 14. Qf2 b5 15. Rac1 Qe7 { Now
possible, as Bc5 can retreat along the other diagonal.} 16. a4 ({I figure
Kramnik would have preferred} 16. Nb3 Bxe3 17. Qxe3 {eyeing that a5-square.})
16... bxa4 17. Nxa4 Bd6 $6 {A surprising choice.} (17... Ba7 {was safe, as} 18.
Nf5 $2 exf5 19. Bxa7 fxe4 {loses a pawn for White.}) 18. Nb3 Bc6 19. Nc3 Rb8
20. Na5 Ba8 21. Nc4 Bc5 22. Rfd1 Rfc8 23. Na4 $6 {True to his style of play,
Magnus seeks some clarification, but taking his knight to the edge of the board
cost him a big chunk of his advantage.} ({The logical choice would have been}
23. Ra1 {to hit the weak pawn. White can also have plans for a central
expansion, such as in} Bxe3 24. Qxe3 Nc5 25. Nd6 Rc6 26. e5 Nfd7 27. f4) 23...
Bxe3 24. Qxe3 Qb4 $1 {A timely activity to interfere with White's plans.} 25.
Qa3 {This was expected from Magnus Carlsen.} (25. Nc3) 25... h6 {[#]} 26. Kf1 (
{White could have accomplished more simplification with the help of a little
tactic} 26. Ncb6 $5 Qxa3 27. Rxc8+ Rxc8 28. bxa3 Nxb6 29. Nxb6 Rb8 30. Nxa8
Rxa8 31. Rc1 $14) 26... g5 27. Rc3 a5 28. Qxb4 axb4 {A welcome pawn structure
change if you're a Caruana fan. Still, White is a little better, and Magnus is
Magnus.} 29. Rcc1 Kf8 30. Na5 Ke7 31. Kf2 Rxc1 32. Rxc1 Ne8 33. Ke3 Nd6 34. Nc5
Rc8 35. Nab3 f5 $6 (35... Ne5 {would have prevented White from trading rooks,
which he needs to accomplish if he's serious about hitting that b4-pawn.}) 36.
Nxd7 Rxc1 37. Nxc1 Kxd7 38. Nd3 $6 ({It is surprising to see Carlsen neglecting
a chance to win a clean pawn after} 38. Bd3 fxe4 39. fxe4 {and there's no
stopping the threat of Na2. Truth be told, White would still be a long ways
from winning the game.} e5 40. Na2 Kc7 41. Nxb4 Kb6) 38... fxe4 39. fxe4 Ke7
40. e5 ({Another option was} 40. Bf3 g4 41. Bxg4 Bxe4 42. Bf3 Bxd3 43. Kxd3 e5
$14) 40... Nf5+ 41. Kf2 Nd4 42. Bd1 b3 43. Nb4 Bd5 44. g3 (44. Nxd5+ exd5 45.
Ke3 Nf5+ 46. Kd3 Ke6 47. Bxb3 Kxe5 {An outside passer is always useful in B vs
N endgames, but here Black is well centralized and therefore should hold.})
44... Bc4 45. Ke3 Nf5+ 46. Ke4 $6 ({More promising seemed} 46. Kd2 Kd7 47. Bf3
Kc7 48. Kc3) 46... Kd7 47. g4 {This pawn will be a target for Black's
counterplay.} Ne7 48. Kd4 Bf1 49. Bxb3 Be2 50. h3 Bf1 51. Nd3 Nc6+ 52. Kc5 $5
{A fancy way to reach a draw that seemed inevitable anyhow.} Bxd3 53. Ba4 Be4
54. Kb6 Bd5 {Of course Black cannot unpin, but he can wait for the White pawn
to come to b5, and then his knight can move away.} 1/2-1/2
