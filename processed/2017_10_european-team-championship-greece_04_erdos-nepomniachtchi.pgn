{We may as well take some note of this competitively very important game:} 1.
Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e3 Nxc3 6. dxc3 Qxd1+ 7. Kxd1 b6 8.
Bb5+ Bd7 9. a4 a6 10. Bxd7+ Nxd7 11. e4 e6 12. Bf4 f6 (12... O-O-O {could have
been called for, to defend the queenside with the king on b7 or even c6.}) 13.
Nd2 Be7 14. Nc4 $14 Kf7 15. Kc2 e5 16. Rhd1 $1 Ke6 17. Be3 Rhb8 {Black wanted .
..b5, so there was no time to mess around with g3, just f4 immediately.} 18. f4
$1 exf4 19. Bxf4 Rb7 20. Rd5 Raa7 21. Nd6 $5 (21. Rad1 b5 22. Nd6 $16 {could
also have been played — Black digs his own grave somewhat by opening the
position.}) 21... Bxd6 22. Rxd6+ Ke7 23. Rc6 Ra8 (23... a5 24. Rc8 {was likely
something that scared Black, because of the domination of both his rooks —
he now has to play} Ne5 {to free them, and enter a depressing single-rook
ending:} 25. Bxe5 fxe5 26. Rd1 Rd7 27. Rb8 Rxd1 28. Kxd1 Rd7+ 29. Kc2 Rd6 30.
Rb7+ Kf6 31. Kb3 $14) 24. a5 $1 {Making use of the small tactics — not
dissimilar to our star game by Bosiocic.} Kf7 25. axb6 {Obviously ...b5 was
never going to be allowed again.} Rxb6 26. Rc7 Ke8 27. Rd1 Rd8 28. Rd6 g5 29.
Bg3 Rxd6 30. Bxd6 {Just like that, a pawn is won; White cashes in and the game
is over.} h5 31. Bxc5 Nxc5 32. Rxc5 Kf7 33. Rd5 Re8 34. Kd3 h4 35. b4 h3 36. g3
Rb8 37. Kd4 Ke6 38. Ra5 Rb6 39. Rc5 Rd6+ 40. Rd5 Rb6 41. g4 Kf7 42. e5 Ke7 43.
Ke4 Rc6 44. Kf5 fxe5 45. Rxe5+ Kf7 46. Re3 a5 47. Rxh3 Kg7 48. bxa5 Rc5+ 49.
Ke6 Rxa5 50. c4 Ra6+ 51. Kd5 Kf7 52. Re3 Ra4 53. h3 {More pitch-perfect
technical chess to complete our trio of rook endings (though this one was only
briefly so.) There might have been just one issue with a hasty Nd6, but
Black's method of bailing out was not an obvious or appealing one even after
that. White made his 2733 opponent look like a statue as he sped past.} 1-0
