1. Nf3 {This move came as a bit of a surprise for Vidit, but in general he was
expecting Magnus to play something off beat.} d5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. O-O (4.
d4 {In order to avoid what happened in the game, White players usually go for
this move order.}) 4... e5 {I like Vidit's decision. He gets the centre and
easy development. Magnus has to decide how he can make use of the extra tempo
in this opposite coloured King's Indian Defence.} 5. d3 Ne7 6. e4 (6. c4 { is
another way to play the position.}) 6... O-O 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. Re1 Nc6 { Black
has excellent development and I would say has already equalized out of the
opening.} 9. Nc3 (9. Nbd2 {with the idea of Nc4 to put more pressure on e5 is
more logical it seems.}) 9... Nde7 10. Rb1 a5 11. b3 Re8 12. Bb2 Nf5 13. Nb5
{With this move Vidit got the counterplay flowing with the move a5-a4.} (13. a4
{could have been a slightly better possibility for White. Although Black seems
to be perfectly fine here as well.}) 13... a4 14. c4 (14. b4 $5 Nxb4 15. Bxe5
$1 $14) 14... axb3 15. axb3 Nd6 $1 {[%cal Gf5d6] This was the move that Vidit
liked very much and after this he did feel that Black had a very comfortable
position. It is counterintuitive that instead of using the d4 square from f5,
the knight jumped back to d6. But the priority was to eliminate the knight from
b5.} 16. Ra1 $6 {This move really gives Black a very pleasant position.} ( 16.
Nc3 Bg4 17. h3 Bxf3 18. Bxf3 Nd4 $11 {/=+}) 16... Rxa1 17. Bxa1 Nxb5 18. cxb5
Nd4 {White has nothing to show for his mangled pawn structure.} 19. Bxd4 ( 19.
Nxd4 exd4 20. Rxe8+ Qxe8 $17) 19... exd4 20. Rxe8+ Qxe8 21. Qc1 {Until now
Vidit has played all the best moves but now starts going wrong. He feels that
Bd7 is the best move and goes for it. But in that process he exchanges his
pretty good c7 pawn with White's weak b5 pawn. White's disadvantage is reduced.
} Bd7 $6 {[%cal Gc8d7]} (21... Bf5 $1 $17) (21... Qe7 $1 $17) 22. Qxc7 Bxb5 23.
Bf1 Bc6 24. Qf4 Bxf3 (24... Qd8 $15 {Maybe on some other ambitious day Vidit
would have played this way. But in general he saw that he could easily make a
draw by taking on f3, and went for it.}) 25. Qxf3 $11 Qc6 26. Qd1 b6 27. Bg2
Qe6 28. Bb7 Bf8 29. Qf3 Kg7 30. Qf4 Qf6 31. Qxf6+ {A draw against the World
Champion with the black pieces is a great achievement.} 1/2-1/2
