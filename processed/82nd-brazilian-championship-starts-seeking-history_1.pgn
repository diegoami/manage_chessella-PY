risky decisions in order to take his opponent out of his preparation, hoping to
compensate the concessions made with errors made from lack of familiarity. The
issues for Black are clear though: his knight and bishop are very poorly placed
on the a-file, and will not easily reposition themselves to the kingside if
needed.} 17. Ndf3  b5  18. Qc2  Ne7 {735 [#] It shows how dangerous this was
for Black, that this almost innocuous seeming move has the engines screaming
blunder in no uncertain terms.} 19. h5  gxh5  ({An example of the danger he
faces can be seen after} 19... g5 {[#]} 20. Nxf7 $3 Kxf7 21. Bxg5 Kg8 (21...

127 Both this and Nxf7 are decisive blows, and the fact that there are two
shows how precarious the king's position is. White has no trouble converting
his attack and wins the day. A tough start for IM Yago Santiago.} Nf5  21. Bxg7
