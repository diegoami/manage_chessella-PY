is unclear, but it surely gives White the best practical chances.} 41. Rxb3 $1

with this result. He did equalize out of the opening, but after that he was
clearly worse. And So played really well to only go back with the half point.})

Kxb3 Ra8 {The discussion can start at this point whether this is really better
for White. But I think it can also end at this point, saying that Wesley
should have gone for this variation irrespective of whether he is winning or
not because he has the best chances to press here. According to the official
commentator Mirochnichenko, White can put his rook on g6 and then try for
something like b4-c5. Although I am not really sure as both rooks can
penetrate after b4 and start perpetual checks. What do you think?}) 43... Kd7 (
