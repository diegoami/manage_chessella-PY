Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Even after a loss to Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Topalov doesn't shy away from the Najdorf.} 6. h3 e5 7. Nde2 h5 {The same line containing g4 was played against MVL. The Frenchman now continued g3. But Anand instead goes for Bg5.} 8. Bg5 Be6 9. Bxf6 {This is a very logical move. The d5 square is a tad weak and hence you get rid of the knight that defends it.} Qxf6 10. Nd5 {Anand has scored already two wins with this move in the World Rapid and Blitz against Bologan and Roiz.} Qd8 11. Qd3 $5 {That's Anand's micro improvement. Instead of playing Nec3 he goes for this queen move which prepares 0-0-0. It hasn't been played by any top player yet, although his trusted second Wojtaszek has faced it from the black side.} g6 $146 {Topalov makes the first new move of the game. He is threatening Bh6 to stop White from 0-0-0.} 12. O-O-O Nd7 13. Kb1 Rc8 14. Nec3 Rc5 {Optically the knight on d5 is strong, but Black plays around it and can later exchange everything with Nb6. So it shouldn't really be so bad. But Black's development is incomplete and hence White should aim to open up the position as soon as possible.} 15. Be2 b5 16. a3 (16. f4 {would have been pretty strong. The point being} exf4 17. Qd4 $1 Rh7 18. Nxf4 $16 {White has a strong initiative.}) 16... Nb6 17. g4 {Anand realizes that he should do something, although f4 was equally tempting at this point.} hxg4 (17... Bxd5 18. exd5 hxg4 19. hxg4 Rxh1 20. Rxh1 Bg7 {could have been an idea to get rid off the d5 weakness, but White retains an edge after} 21. Ne4 Rxd5 22. Qc3 Qc8 23. Qf3 $36 {[%cal Ge4f6] }) 18. Nxb6 $6 (18. hxg4 Rxh1 19. Rxh1 Bxd5 20. exd5 Bg7 {just transposes to the variation we just saw above where White was better. So Anand should have gone for this.}) 18... Qxb6 19. hxg4 Rxh1 20. Rxh1 Bg7 21. Qe3 Qb7 (21... a5 22. b4 $1 $18) 22. Rd1 Qc7 23. g5 {Fixing the structure on the kingside. White doesn't have a huge edge but it is definitely not so easy for Black to play.} Qc6 24. Rg1 {Anand prepares the plan of exchanging the light squared bishops.} Qd7 25. Qg3 Rc8 26. Bg4 $1 {Of course the dream scenario is to get rid of the light squared bishops and plonk the knight on d5.} Bxg4 {It might seem to be a huge concession to do this - Topalov could have waited for Anand to take on e6 and then take back with the pawn and the d5 square is covered. But that would also have been dangerous.} (26... a5 27. Bxe6 fxe6 28. Qd3 Rb8 29. Nd1 $1 { A nice maneuvre getting the knight to a better square.} Qc6 30. Ne3 b4 31. a4 $16) 27. Qxg4 Qxg4 28. Rxg4 Bf8 29. Nd5 $14 {[%csl Gd5,Rf8] Topalov has pinned his hopes on defending this inferior ending where the knight on d5 is an octopus in every way. The plan in such positions is usually simple. Keep control and create a passer on the queenside where you have the majority and use your king, rook and knight to shepherd the pawn to the queening square. However the difficulty here is that the g5 pawn is weak and the rook has to constantly babysit it. In any case this is an enjoyable position for White who can keep shuffling around for quite some time.} Be7 30. c3 Rc6 31. Kc2 Kd7 32. Kb3 Bd8 33. a4 {Anand begins the task of creating a queenside passer.} Rc5 34. axb5 Rxb5+ (34... axb5 $11 {Could have made White's task of creating a passed pawn much difficult.}) 35. Ka2 a5 36. b4 axb4 37. cxb4 {So step one has been completed. The next task is to get the rook in to the game somehow.} Rb7 38. Kb3 Rb8 39. Rg1 Rb7 40. Rg3 Rb8 41. Rg1 Rb7 42. Ra1 $5 {Anand foresakes the g5 pawn and gets his rook in to the action. Maybe playing f3 before doing this could have been a good idea though. But it doesn't matter much. The position is sort of static in nature.} Bxg5 43. Kc4 Bd8 44. f3 f5 {Topalov tries to exchange as many pawns as he can.} 45. Rh1 fxe4 46. fxe4 g5 47. b5 Rb8 48. Rh7+ Ke6 {Could have been safer to go to c8. On e6 the king is in a mating net.} 49. Kb4 {It is zugzwang time. The rook cannot move away from b-file as b6 would come and the bishop cannot move away from the control of the e7 square as there is a mate. The king cannot move at all!} (49. b6 {looks natural but would be hasty and throw away all the advantage after} Rxb6 $1 50. Nxb6 Bxb6 $11 {This is most probably a fortress.}) 49... g4 50. Rg7 g3 51. Rxg3 Rb7 52. Rg6+ Kd7 53. Rg7+ Kc8 54. Rg8 Kd7 55. Kc4 Rb8 (55... Kc8 56. b6 $18) 56. Rg7+ Ke6 57. Kb4 {We get the same zugzwang position without the g-pawn and White is just winning.} Ba5+ $5 {The final trick.} 58. Kc4 $6 (58. Kxa5 {would also have won.} Rxb5+ 59. Ka4 Ra5+ 60. Kb3 Ra3+ 61. Kc4 Ra4+ 62. Nb4 $18 {This should not be difficult to convert.}) (58. Ka4 $1 {Would have won the game with ease. The key point here was} Bd8 {is strongly refuted by} 59. Ra7 $1 { Black is left without any good moves.} Rc8 60. b6 $18) 58... Bd8 59. Rg8 Rc8+ { Black again has some good chances to defend now.} 60. Kd3 (60. Kb4 $5 {was a nice trap.} Ba5+ $2 {Falling right into it.} 61. Kxa5 Rxg8 62. b6 $18 {And surprisingly the pawn cannot be stopped.}) 60... Rb8 61. Rh8 Kd7 62. Rh7+ Ke6 ( 62... Kc8 $1 {would have made White's task to win very tough.}) 63. Kc4 Rc8+ 64. Kb4 Rc1 (64... Rb8 65. Ra7 $18 {as we have seen is the final zugzwang.}) 65. b6 {Finally the pawn moves ahead and it's all over.} Rb1+ 66. Ka5 Bxb6+ 67. Nxb6 {This position is easily winning for White because he can defend his e4 pawn with Rh4 and the knight keeps the d5 breaks under control. It's all about bringing the king in now.} Ra1+ 68. Kb5 Rb1+ 69. Kc6 Rc1+ 70. Kb7 Rb1 71. Kc7 Rc1+ 72. Kd8 Re1 73. Rh4 Kf6 74. Rg4 {A fine victory for Anand who played a consistent game. He could have finished the battle sooner on a few occasions but in the end he got the job done!} 1-0
