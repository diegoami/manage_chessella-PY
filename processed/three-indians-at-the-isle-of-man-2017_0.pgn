bishop on e3, but it would have been interesting to see how he did that.}) 11.

for White here and because of the opposite coloured bishops on the board, he is
able to launch a strong attack on his opponent's king.} Bxf1 32. Rxf1 Kf8 {The
king feels uncomfortable inside the box, but outside also it is not all safe.}

by Anand.} 1-0
