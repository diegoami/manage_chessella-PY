        usually play the Queen's Gambit Accepted but in this game he goes for 
        it.} 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bxc4 e6 5. Nf3 c5 6. O-O Nc6 7. Qe2 cxd4 8. Rd1 Be7 
        9. exd4 O-O 10. Nc3 Na5 {Until now we have seen the normal moves. This 
        knight sortie to the side of the board is a little abnormal. But the idea 
        is to force the bishop away from the control of d5, so that d4-d5 is no 
        longer a threat and then play b6 followed by Bb7.} 11. Bd3 b6 12. Bg5 
        Bb7 {Diagram [#] It seems as if Black is quite nicely developed. Logical 
        moves for White would be Rc1 or Ne5. However, Erwin thought for a while 
        and decided to spice up things with a pawn sacrifice.} 13. d5 $5 { Nearly 
        142 games had reached the previous position but only one continued with 
        d4-d5. The move is tricky, but against a careful opponent it is at best 
        tricky and cannot guarantee an advantage.} exd5 (13... Nxd5 14. Bxh7+

        game by Erwin.} 1-0
