but Maxime figured out some improvements and confidently drew against So in
2015.}) 15... a6 16. Na3 {And the novelty.} (16. Nd4 Qc7 17. Nb3 Rd8 18. Qc2 c4

Now White who has avoided the aimless hopping around with the knight, gets
down to business.} 17. f4 $1 Rd8 18. Qc2 Ng4 (18... Qa5 19. fxe5 Qxa3 20. Bc4
Be6 {may be enough to hold, but lacking proper research MVL didn't judge it
reliable.}) 19. Bxg4 Bxg4 20. f5 $1 {[#] This is a typical idea of isolating
the bishop. It may not end up lost, but only trapped behind its own pawns.
Anyway, a great concept from Sergey.} gxf5 ({The aggressive} 20... Qe5 21. Rf4

fxg2 28. Rfe1 {[#]On the face of it, Black has a great game: two pawns for the
exchange with a bishop pair and an open White king. Truth is, he's
significantly worse, if not outright lost. What gives? The key factor is the
activity of White's pieces. In a few moves he will achive a dominating
position.} Bf3 ({The white king is actually quite safe behind that pawn, and
the only way to bother it can be a check from d4. However, the try} 28... Bxc3

The resulting ending is similar to the Aronian-Mamedyarov game played the next
