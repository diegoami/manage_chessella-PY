Be6 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. Nd5 Qd8 11. Qd3 Nd7 12. O-O-O g6 13. Kb1 {The thing about
top players like Giri is that they are not only very well updated with the
latest games but they also find improvements over it. Here the players are
following the game Anand vs Topalov from the London Chess Classic that took
place 20 days ago. Anand had won a nice game with white so Ganguly tried it
once again but Anish already had an improvement prepared.} Nc5 (13... Rc8 { was
Anand-Topalov.}) 14. Qf3 Bg7 15. Nec3 b5 16. Be2 Rb8 17. a3 Bd7 {Defending the
b5 pawn and preparing a5-b4.} 18. Qe3 a5 19. b4 {While this stops b4, one thing
is certain that White's king is quite exposed now.} Ne6 20. g3 Nd4 21. Bd3 Be6

28. hxg4 Rxh1 29. Rxh1 Be6 {Black has won a pawn and looks pretty solid,
although White with his excellent knights does have some compensation.} 30. g5
$6 (30. Qe4 {with the idea of Nc7 was interesting.}) 30... Kf8 31. Nf6 Ra6 32.
Qf3 Qc7 33. Nh7+ Ke8 34. Nf6+ Bxf6 35. gxf6 Kd7 {Black got rid of his bad
bishop and his king is also safe. Add to it the fact that he is a pawn up and
you can realize that the rest is just a matter of technique for a player of
Giri's calibre.} 36. Rd1 Qa7 37. Kb2 Bc4 38. Qe4 Kc7 39. Nd5+ Kb8 40. Nc3 Kc7

51. Qe7+ Kf5 {would have been quite an easy win for Anish. The king escapes the
perpetual and the e-pawn marches towards the last rank.}) 48. Kc1 Qa6 49. Qg5
Kd6 50. Qg8 Qa3+ 51. Kd2 Qa7 52. Qe8 Qd7 53. Qg8 Qb7 54. Qe8 Qd7 (54... e4 55.
Qg8 Qa7 56. Qe8 Qd7 57. Qg8 Ke5 $19 {It is important to activate the king is in
order to win. The f6 pawn will fall now.}) 55. Qg8 e4 56. Qg3+ Kc6 57. Qe5 Qc7
58. Qe8+ Kb6 59. Qe7 {White has just too much activity now.} Qf4+ 60. Kd1 Qf1+
61. Kd2 Qf4+ 62. Kd1 e3 63. Qd8+ Ka6 64. Qa8+ Kb6 65. Qd8+ Ka6 { Quite a
depressing draw for Anish, who was better for almost the entire game. A great
result for Ganguly who is having a superb tournament.} 1/2-1/2
