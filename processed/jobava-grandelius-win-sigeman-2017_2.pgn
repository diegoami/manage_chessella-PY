Nf3 e6 5. d4 Nh6 6. Nc3 Bg4 7. Bd3 $6 ( 7. h3 $142 Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Nf5 9. Be3 {was probably better. White would be happy to exchange off the dark square bishop and try for f5.}) 7... Nf5 8. Bxf5 Bxf5 9. O-O Be7 {Already after 9 moves, Black has an edge.} 10. a4 c5 $1 {typical response against a4. Black prepares to gain space on the queenside and the light squares.} 11. Be3 c4 12. Ne2 h5 {prepares to secure f5.} 13. Ng3 Bg6 14. Ne1 Qd7 15. Qf3 (15. f5 Bxf5 16. Nxh5 (16. Nxf5 exf5 17. Qf3 g6 {is simply a pawn up.}) 16... Rg8 {is a comfortable edge for Black.}) 15... h4 16. f5 { White has to complicate things somehow.} hxg3 17. fxg6 gxh2+ 18. Kh1 f5 19. g4 f4 $1 20. Ng2 {White has to turn to desperate measures, as strategically his position is just worse.} fxe3 21. Qf7+ Kd8 22. Nf4 Kc7 23. Nxe6+ Kb6 24. a5+ Ka6 $4 {The king appears safe and well protected by White's pawn,however, this allows White deadly tacical threats. One pattern is the mate with Nc7#. Another is Nc5+ whenever the b8 knight moves. White plays Nxg7 and then comes back to e6. Black finds it hard to improve his position without moving the knight from b8.} (24... Kc6 $142 25. Qxg7 Na6 26. Qf7 e2 27. Rf2 Nc7 $19) 25. b4 $2 {Short played this move with one minute remaining, so it's entirely understandable. Having stood worse for most part of the game, he would've also psychologically consdired his position worse.} (25. Nxg7 $142 {And White is almost winning here. For example:} Nc6 26. Ne6 Qc8 27. g7 Rg8 28. Qxg8 $1 $18) 25... cxb3 26. Rfb1 Rc8 27. Qf1+ Qb5 28. Qxb5+ Kxb5 29. Rxb3+ Ka6 {Now, White is just lost.} 30. Rxe3 Rc6 31. Nxg7 Rxg6 32. Ne8 Rc6 33. c3 Nd7 34. Ng7 Rac8 35.
