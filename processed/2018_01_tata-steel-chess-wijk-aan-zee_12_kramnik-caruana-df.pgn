1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Ne5 Nc6 {There can be nothing
wrong with Black's position after this, but it does vaguely give in to White's
stated ambition of winning the bishop pair.} (5... e6 {is normal, and then
Black can castle before challenging the e5-knight. Another alternative was to
play 4...Nc6.}) 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. Nxd7 Qxd7 (7... Nxd7 8. c3 a6 9. Bd3 b5 10. O-O
e6 {is one conceivable way to launch a plausible minority attack.}) 8. c3 {
Objectively, White has nothing, but his position is laughably easy to play.
Nd2-f3, short castling, bishop back to d3, other one probably to g5...} e6 9.

d4.}) 15... Nfg4 16. h3 Nxf3+ 17. Qxf3 Ne5 18. Qf5 Qxf5 19. Bxf5 h6 $11 {
For tactical reasons Black wins back one of the pair for his knight.}) 13. dxe5
Nxe5 14. Nf3 Nfg4 {Giving White something.} (14... Rfe8 {transposes to the
last note.}) 15. Nxe5 Nxe5 16. Bc2 Rfe8 (16... Ng4 $5 17. h3 Bh2+ 18. Kf1 Ne5 {
looks quite contrived, though it may be that White has nothing better than
diving into mess with} 19. g4 $13) 17. Bf4 Bc7 18. g3 {A great 'little move',
creating a hideaway on g2 and protecting the f4-bishop just in case.} Rad8 (
18... Nc4 19. Rxe8+ Rxe8 20. Bxc7 Qxc7 21. Qxd5 g6 (21... Nxb2 22. Rb1 Qxc3 23.
Qb3 {is a great knight trap- even though it contains a small flaw:} Re1+ $8 24.
Rxe1 Qxe1+ 25. Kg2 Qe5 26. Qxb7 $16) 22. Bb3 $14 {This +/= is smaller than a
few others in this analysis, because the knight is a tricky beast.}) 19. Bxh7+
{Winning a clear pawn.} Kxh7 20. Bxe5 Bxe5 21. Qh5+ Kg8 22. Rxe5 Rxe5 (22... d4
{was principled}) 23. Qxe5 Re8 24. Qd4 Qb5 (24... Re2 25. c4 $1 $16) 25. b3 Re2

31. Kh2 Qxc3 32. Qd8+ Kh7 33. Qxd5 Qf6 34. Kg2 $16 {leads to a queen ending
which may be a draw with best play, but that is very hard to demonstrate.}) 29.
Re5 (29. Qd1 $5 $16 {is a bizarre computer recommendation, using the fact that
Black will find it hard to defend against Qf3 and Re7.}) 29... Qf6 (29... Ra1+
30. Kh2 Ra2 $14 {now keeps White a bit tied down to his weak pawns, even
though he is still better.}) 30. Qe3 Ra1+ 31. Kg2 Ra5 32. h5 (32. b4 Rb5 33.
Re8+ Kh7 34. Qd3+ g6 35. h5 {was maybe a more direct way to prise open the
Black king position.}) 32... d4 (32... Rc5 $5 $16 {limited the damage}) 33.
cxd4 Rxe5 34. Qxe5 $1 $18 {The rest is quite simple by the standards of elite
games.} Qd8 (34... Qxe5 35. dxe5 a5 36. Kf3 b5 37. Ke4 $18) 35. d5 a5 36. d6
