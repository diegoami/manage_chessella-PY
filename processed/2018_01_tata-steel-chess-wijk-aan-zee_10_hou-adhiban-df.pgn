1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. Re1 {White opts to play
that rare creature, the Fianchetto KID without c4. There can be nothing really
wrong with it but the game now resembles something more like a Philidor with a
slightly strange fianchetto for White.} Nbd7 7. e4 e5 8. Nc3 c6 9. a4 Re8 (9...

Lobron,E-Gelfand,B Biel 1993}) 10. h3 Qc7 11. Be3 b6 12. Qd2 Bb7 13. Rad1 Rad8
$11 {So, both sides have completed development and it is up to White what he
wants to do about ...d5, which may be coming soon. It is perhaps not so
strange that the play vaguely resembles some of the Breyer sidelines examined
yesterday in the notes to Anand-Carlsen.} 14. Bg5 (14. Bh6 a6 15. Bxg7 Kxg7 {
is no panacea for White, who must still worry about slow play: ...h6, ...b5, ..
.Qb6, maybe eventually ...c5.}) 14... a6 15. h4 b5 16. axb5 axb5 17. b3 (17. h5
$5 {initiates some bizarre complications. For instance:} exd4 18. Nxd4 b4 19.
Na2 Ne5 $13) 17... Qb8 18. dxe5 (18. h5 {is again worth at least calculating,
though Black has a bail-out option in ...h6 intending ...Nxh5.}) 18... dxe5 19.
Bh3 Nf8 20. Qe3 Rxd1 21. Rxd1 Bc8 22. Bxc8 Rxc8 {This is now a fully
believable Breyer Ruy Lopez, except the pawn at c2, which should be on c4.} 23.
Bxf6 Bxf6 24. Na2 Ne6 25. Nb4 {As a firm believer in the knight, it was
interesting to watch this game and see how convincing or otherwise the 'bad'
dark-square bishop was against it. ('bad' is in quotes because I do know a
thing or two about the KID!)} Be7 26. Nd3 f6 27. h5 g5 $6 (27... Kf7 $11 {
was maybe better, not making too many pawn weaknesses.}) 28. b4 Rd8 (28... Rc7
29. Ndxe5 $13 {is messy, but could have been Black's best.}) 29. Ra1 Rd7 30.
Nh2 Nd4 31. Ra2 (31. Qd2 $5 {tries to arrange a queen lift to a2.} Ra7 {
causes a cascade of tactical issues, beginning} 32. Rxa7 Qxa7 33. c3 $14) 31...
Ra7 32. Rb2 Ra3 33. Qd2 Qa8 (33... c5 $132 {is a better 'human' move, trying
to get the queen to c6.} 34. Nxc5 Qe8 {and White is having to defend on a
number of fronts.}) 34. c3 Ne6 $2 35. Ne1 $6 (35. Nxe5 fxe5 36. Qd7 Kf7 37. Ng4
$16 {is winning after some convoluted tactical lines!}) (35. Ng4 $14 {is safe
and 'normal'.}) 35... Ra1 36. Kf1 $2 (36. Kg2 {is still good for the knights.
For instance:} c5 37. Nc2 $1 (37. Qd5 $6 Qxd5 38. exd5 Nc7 $15) 37... Ra6 38.
Qe2 $14) 36... c5 37. f3 cxb4 38. cxb4 Nd4 (38... Qa3 {is almost winning, e.g.}
39. Kf2 Bd8 $17 (39... Rd1 $5)) 39. Kg2 Qa3 {By contrast with the last note,
now Black lacks the tempo to play ...Rxe1 against Kg2.} 40. Nd3 Qa4 41. Nc1 Qa3
42. Ne2 Bxb4 {There is nothing better than cashing in. In what follows, I have
made brief notes rather than giving variations, knowing that better analysts
than myself will pick apart the endgame.} 43. Qxb4 Qxb4 44. Rxb4 Ra2 45. Ng4
Kg7 46. Kf1 Nxe2 47. Rxb5 Nxg3+ 48. Kg1 {And so we reach an unpleasant endgame
for White, but still one that is probably technically drawn.} Ne2+ 49. Kf1 Ng3+
50. Kg1 Nxh5 51. Rb7+ Kg6 52. Rb6 Kg7 53. Rb7+ Kg6 54. Rb6 Ra5 55. Kf2 {
Black lacks moves here- all his pieces are tied down to their present
positions. A pawn sacrifice will become necessary.} Kg7 56. Rb7+ Kg6 57. Rb6

deserves to succeed.}) 76. Rd7 Ra6 77. Nf5 Ra2+ 78. Kg1 Ne2+ (78... Nh3+ 79.
Kh1 Nf2+ 80. Kg1 g4 $15 {kept the game a bit more lively, but is unlikely to
ultimately lead to more than rook and knight vs rook.}) 79. Kh1 Ng3+ 80. Nxg3

by forcing her to demonstrate the need to play Ra8 only after ...f3.} 1/2-1/2
