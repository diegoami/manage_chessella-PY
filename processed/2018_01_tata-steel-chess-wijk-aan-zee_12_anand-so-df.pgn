1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 {Perhaps forgetting, or
not knowing, that the Open Ruy Lopez was basically co-invented by Anand, in
New York 1995 (it existed before, but his role was similar to that of Kramnik
with the Berlin Wall!)} 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Nbd2 Be7 ({A little
history lesson is in order, beginnning with the move} 9... Nc5 {:} 10. c3 d4 (
10... Be7 {exists too, but after} 11. Bc2 {I feel White must have a more
pleasant position}) 11. Ng5 $5 {One of the most shocking moves in 'modern'
opening theory to an impressionable 9-year-old me, learning chess in 2004!}
dxc3 $6 (11... Qxg5 {was obviously tried too, and with best play Black is
committing to a piece sacrifice.} 12. Qf3 O-O-O 13. Bxe6+ fxe6 14. Qxc6 Qxe5
15. b4 Qd5 $1 $44 {Grischuk,A-Anand,V Wijk aan Zee 2005}) 12. Nxe6 fxe6 13.
bxc3 Qd3 14. Nf3 (14. Bc2 $5 Qxc3 15. Nb3 $13 {was ultimately decided upon as
White's best, and Black is in quite a bit of trouble here.}) 14... O-O-O 15.
Qe1 Nxb3 16. axb3 Kb7 17. Be3 Be7 18. Bg5 (18. Qc1 $5 $40) 18... h6 (18... Rhe8
$11) 19. Bxe7 Nxe7 20. Nd4 Rxd4 21. cxd4 Qxb3 22. Qe3 Qxe3 23. fxe3 Nd5 24. Kf2
Kb6 $44 {Black had enough compensation to draw in Kasparov,G -Anand,V New York
1995}) 10. c3 O-O 11. Bc2 f5 (11... Bf5 $5) 12. Nb3 (12. exf6 Nxf6 13. Nb3 Bg4
14. Qd3 $32 {looks hard to play for Black, but maybe it is just me. A useful
game to look at: Anton Guijarro,D-Vidit,S Martuni 2016}) 12... Qd7 13. Nfd4
Nxd4 14. Nxd4 c5 15. Nxe6 Qxe6 16. f3 Ng5 17. a4 (17. Bxg5 Bxg5 18. f4 $14 {
might have been worth playing, not least to remind Wesley of his loss to
Carlsen from this event!}) 17... Rad8 (17... b4 {makes the game quite
strategically messy, but probably still better for White.}) 18. axb5 axb5 19.
Bxg5 (19. Ra7 Rd7 20. Rxd7 Qxd7 21. Bxg5 Bxg5 22. f4 Bd8 23. b3 $14 {is
another take, with c4 to come soon}) 19... Bxg5 20. f4 {So we get here anyway!
However, here Black has good play through the centre.} Be7 21. Kh1 (21. b4 $5 {
was vaguely Carlsenesque, but objectively Black should have no problem after
accepting:} cxb4 22. cxb4 Bxb4 23. Qd3 $44) 21... d4 $1 {It is not only White
who can play with colour complexes.} 22. cxd4 c4 {Threatening ...Bc5, and Ra5
is met with ...Qb6.} 23. b3 (23. Qd2 $5 Qd5 (23... Bc5 24. Qa5 $16) 24. Ra5 {
would have tested Black more, though he still has compensation.}) 23... Bc5 24.

Neutralised by a whisker!} 30. Rxd8+ Bxd8 31. Ba4 Qb6 32. Qxb6 Bxb6 1/2-1/2
