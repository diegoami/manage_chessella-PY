1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 {The Anti-Grunfeld move order, but presumably Black
had no intention of playing anything other than a King's Indian anyway.} d6 4.
d4 Bg7 5. h3 Na6 6. Be3 O-O 7. g4 (7. Nf3 {led surprisingly quickly to an
unfavourable position in a predecessor by the same player.} c6 8. Rc1 e5 9. d5
cxd5 (9... Nc5 $5) 10. cxd5 $14 {In Nepomniachtchi,I-Adhiban,B Tbilisi 2017
the position was already hard to play for Black, and this is not just the
standard machine dislike of the King's Indian!}) 7... c5 {Gawain Jones chose
an approach with ...e5 instead, earlier in this event.} 8. Nge2 b6 $5 {Not a
machine top choice, but the only move to play a substantially different
position from the ones after ...cxd4, ...Nd7, et cetera, which are just
mangled Maroczy binds.} 9. e5 (9. Bg2 Bb7 10. d5 Nc7 11. O-O Nd7 {would have
been the principled continuation from both sides- Black will manage to arrange
a plausible ...b5, ...e6 or ...f5 break in the near future and thus has a
fully playable game.}) 9... Ne8 {Now, as in the classic game Letelier-Fischer,
White's centre appears to be on the brink of being detonated.} 10. Bg2 Rb8 11.
O-O Bb7 12. Bxb7 (12. f4 Bxg2 13. Kxg2 Qc7 {will not hold up White's centre
for long. Ideas for Black include not only ...cxd4 but also ...Qb7 and ...Nac7.
}) 12... Rxb7 13. Qa4 Nec7 $6 (13... Nb4 {was more convincing, if a bit
inhuman: after} 14. a3 $6 Nd3 $1 $15 {White's centre is toast. So he must
voluntarily dismantle it with 14.exd6 or similar.}) 14. exd6 exd6 15. Rad1 Qh4
(15... Qe8 16. Qxe8 Rxe8 17. Rd2 $14 {is very comfortable for White, because
his centre is even nicer than in the game.}) 16. Kg2 f5 17. f3 {The situation
has now stabilised and seems to be marginally in White's favour.} Qe7 18. Bf2
Qe8 (18... Nb4 {was again the move, resting upon the slightly awkward-looking
tactical nuance} 19. a3 Na2 $1 $11) 19. Qxe8 Nxe8 20. g5 Nec7 21. Bg3 Ne6 (
21... b5 {was maybe the last chance for Black to try and claim an opening
success.} 22. Bxd6 Re8 23. dxc5 b4 {and amidst significant complications Black
seems to be completely fine.}) 22. d5 Nxg5 23. Bxd6 Rd8 24. Bg3 $14 Nf7 25. Nf4
Bxc3 26. bxc3 Nd6 27. Ne6 Rdd7 28. Bxd6 Rxd6 29. Rfe1 Nc7 30. Nf4 (30. Nxc7
Rxc7 31. Re5 {would have been my choice, because reputation aside, rook
endings offer no worse winning chances than other kinds of ending with the
same size of advantage!}) 30... Kf8 31. a4 a6 32. Nd3 Rb8 33. Re5 (33. Ne5 $16)
33... b5 {White is now on the verge of losing control of the situation.} 34.
Nxc5 $6 (34. Nb2 $14 {just about retained a measure of control; White is going
to get the c4-square for his knight. For instance:} Kf7 35. cxb5 axb5 36. axb5
Nxb5 37. Nc4 {and the technical battle continues.}) 34... bxc4 35. Rd4 Kf7 36.
Kg3 Rb1 (36... Re8 {was much safer; White has no way to win a pawn with or
without compensation.}) 37. Rxc4 Rxd5 38. Rxd5 Nxd5 39. Nxa6 {Now the position
is still broadly speaking equal, but there is an imbalance, and it is often
much harder to prove compensation than to fight against it, particularly in
simplified positions.} Rc1 (39... Rg1+ 40. Kf2 Ra1 $11 {was apparently the way
to go, intending ...Ra3, and the pawn should be coming home.}) 40. a5 $1 (40.
Nb4 Nxc3 41. Kh4 Rb1 $11 {escapes}) 40... Nxc3 $6 (40... g5 $5 41. Nb4 f4+ 42.
Kf2 Nxb4 43. Rxb4 Rc2+ $1 44. Ke1 Rxc3 45. Ra4 {and now the rook endgame would
be unpleasant were it not for} Rxf3 $1 $11) 41. Kh4 (41. Rc7+ Ke6 $1 42. Rc6+
Ke5 $1 43. Kh4 $14 {might be interesting, forestalling the idea seen in the
game (i.e. ...h6 and ...g5.)}) 41... h6 {The game is still within the drawing
margin, but Black is really cutting it fine.} 42. Nc5 g5+ 43. Kh5 Rh1 44. Kxh6
Rxh3+ 45. Kxg5 Rxf3 {Home and dry.} 46. a6 Ne4+ 47. Nxe4 fxe4 48. Ra4 Rg3+ 49.
