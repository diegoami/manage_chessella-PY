It is a complicated battle where White does not mind giving up his c6 rook for the bishop in order to get a strong passed pawn. But with his imaginative move, Markus Ragger just increases the stakes of the battle.} 32. Nxd6 $5 Bxc6 33. Nf5 Be8 34. Nxh6+ {White has currently two pawns for the rook, but his co-ordination is excellent.} Kh8 35. Nf5 Rc8 36. Qd3 {Once you look deeper you understand now that the g5 knight is badly pinned and the e5 pawn is about to fall. Things are looking pretty grim for Black.} Rg8 37. Nxe5 (37. d6 {with the threat of Nxg5 Rxg5 Bxg5 Qxg5 d7 is not so easy to meet.} Bxa4 38. Nxe5 $44 {with excellent compensation.}) 37... Qf6 38. Nf3 Bd7 39. Qd2 (39. Nxg5 Rxg5 40. Rxf4 Bxf5 41. Qf1 $1 (41. Rxf5 $2 Rc1+ 42. Kh2 Bd6+ 43. g3 Qxb2+ $19) 41... Kg8 42. Bxg5 Qxg5 43. Rxf5 {With four pawns for a piece and pretty good compensation.}) 39... Bxf5 40. Qxf4 Bh6 41. exf5 Rcd8 {Grischuk defends in the most tenacious fashion possible. The funny thing about this position is that White is a rook down and his pawns are not so threatening, yet the position is just around equal. This speaks something about the nature of White's compensation.} 42. Ne5 (42. Rd1 $1 $13 {Maintaining the tension is the best. Ne5-g6 is coming up.} Kh7 43. Ne5 Nxh3 44. gxh3 Bxf4 45. Bxf6 $11) 42... Rxd5 43. Ng4 Qd6 44. Qxd6 Rxd6 45. Bg3 Rc6 46. Be5+ Kh7 47. Nf6+ Rxf6 48. Bxf6 {Ragger wins back some material. Now he has three pawns for a piece, but his dynamism is lost and now Grischuk has very little difficulty in converting this position.} Ne4 49. Be5 Bg7 50. f6 Re8 $1 51. fxg7 (51. Bd4 Ng3+ $19) 51... Rxe5 52. Rf3 Nc5 53. Rf6 Re6 54. Rf4 Re4 55. Rf6 Re6 56. Rf4 Kxg7 57. Rg4+ Kf7 58. Rf4+ Ke7 59. Kh2 Re4 {A wonderful game. Beautiful imaginative play by Ragger. It was a pity that he wasn't rewarded for it. But one has to agree that Grischuk defended in the most tenacious fashion.} 0-1
