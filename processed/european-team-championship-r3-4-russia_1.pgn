Nf3 d5 4. g3 {After Eljanov's victory in the Catalan against Nakamura at the Candidates 2015, one thing is for sure no one can underestimate Pavel's preparation.} dxc4 5. Bg2 a6 6. O-O Nc6 7. e3 Rb8 8. Nfd2 Qd7 9. Nxc4 b5 10. Ncd2 Be7 {The players had been following Tukmakov-Bagirov until this point. But now Pavel decides to go his own way.} 11. Nb3 {The thing that is usally most important in this position is whether White can establish a clamp on c5 or Black can get in that move. In fact this is the struggle in most of the lines of the Catalan where Black plays b7-b5.} O-O 12. Nc3 Rd8 13. Qe2 a5 $5 14. Rd1 (14. Nxb5 a4 $1 {A nice intermezzo.} 15. Nd2 Ba6 $19 { simply loses a piece.}) 14... a4 15. Nc5 Qe8 (15... Bxc5 16. dxc5 {is actually a good trade-off for Black as now there is no weakness on c-file. But here he experiences specific difficulties as the queen is attacked and the knight on c6 is quite loose.} Qe8 17. Rxd8 Nxd8 18. e4 $14) 16. N3e4 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 e5 $1 {That's the right decision to break in the centre. Black cannot allow White to just finish his development with Bd2 and Rc1.} 18. d5 Nb4 19. Nc3 Na6 20. b3 $1 axb3 21. axb3 Nc5 22. Qc2 {The position is complex and unbalanced. Mamedyarov has done well not to let White's advantage get out of hand. Yet if you look closely, thanks to the d5 pawn White has a much more pleasant position.} Bg4 23. Rd2 Bh5 24. Bb2 Bg6 25. e4 Bd6 26. Rdd1 Ra8 27. b4 Na6 $6 (27... Na4 { was surely the need of the hour. After this Black should not be seriously worse.}) 28. Na2 $6 (28. Qe2 {was the cool move. The point being that the exchange of the b4 and b5 pawns is in White's favour as then the c7 pawn would be quite weak.} Rdb8 (28... Nxb4 29. Nxb5 $16) (28... Bxb4 29. Nxb5 $16) 29. Bf1 $1 $16) 28... f6 29. h4 Qd7 (29... Nxb4 30. Nxb4 Bxb4 31. Rxa8 Rxa8 32. Qxc7 Qd8 {would have been around equal.}) 30. Ba3 Ra7 31. Rab1 Rda8 32. Bc1 Nb8 33. Nc3 Na6 34. Na2 Nb8 35. Nc3 Na6 36. Qe2 {Eljanov strikes the right plan of getting the b5 pawn for the b4 one.} Nxb4 37. Nxb5 Ra2 38. Rd2 Ra1 39. Rdb2 R8a2 40. Rxa2 Rxb1 (40... Rxa2 41. Bb2 $16) 41. Ra8+ Bf8 (41... Kf7 42. Nxd6+ cxd6 43. Qc4 $16 {followed by Kh2 and getting the bishop out is a clearly better position for White.}) 42. Qc4 (42. Qf1 $3 $18 {would have been a nice move. It not only defends the c1 bishop but also prepares Bh3 or Nc3-Qc4. trapping the rook on b1.}) 42... Na2 43. Qxa2 Rxc1+ 44. Kh2 Qxb5 45. d6+ Bf7 46. Qa3 (46. Qa3 {Mamedyarov's resignation is not premature. He is unconditionally lost, although it might not be quite apparent on the surface.} Rc5 (46... Qc5 47. Qxc5 Rxc5 48. d7 $18) (46... cxd6 47. Qxc1 $18) 47. d7 Qxd7 48. Qxc5 $18) 1-0
