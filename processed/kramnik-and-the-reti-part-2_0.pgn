Bent Larsen, this move forces White to close the diagonal with} 6. d4 { which
was not in his plans. A recent blitz game between two young Russian stars
proved the point:} c5 7. Bb2 Nc6 8. Na3 O-O 9. c3 Qa5 10. Rc1 Bf5 11. h3 Rad8

{Chigaev-Praggnanandhaa, 2016. Black is still under pressure to protect his
Q-side pawns, but if he manages to to do so, he'll have some prospects to play
for a win.}) 7. b4 Nfd7 $5 {An interesting idea going back to Miles-I.Sokolov,
1988} (7... O-O 8. O-O Nc6 ({Also known is} 8... Re8 9. d3 e5 10. bxc5 Nfd7) 9.

clears out the long diagonal for his bishop with the help of a standard knight

stir some trouble was} 18... Bc3 19. Rd1 Bb4 {but it's counterintuitive to
