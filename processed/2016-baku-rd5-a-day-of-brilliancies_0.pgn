Bxf6 {(2s) Stupak has no interest in a theoretical duel in the 'Moscow variation'.} Qxf6 {(7s)} 7. e3 {(3s)} g6 {(31s)} 8. e4 $5 {(7s) A very rare choice and an odd continuation.} dxe4 {(318s)} 9. Nxe4 {(2s)} Bb4+ {(8s)} 10. Ke2 {(1s) The computers cry that this is a bad move but the idea of taking his majesty to the battlefield dates back to the time of Steinintz when he used to, sometimes, opt for 1.e4 e5 2.f4 ef4 3. d4?! Qh4+ 4.Ke2 !!} Qg7 {(8s)} 11. c5 {(132s) Stupak cuts off this bishop and his entire plan revolves around keeping the bishop on c8 out of the game.} O-O {(15s)} 12. Qa4 {(783s)} Na6 {( 75s)} 13.

Bg2 { and I do not see how Black is going to prove that he has enough compensation when his material investment has gone from an exchange to a whole rook!}) 28... Re8+ {(59s)} (28... Qe7+ 29.
