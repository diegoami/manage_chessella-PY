43... Ba2 {After winning a pawn in the opening, Grandelius started misplaying
his position. By this point it is White that is playing for a win, at least
objectively, but of course the 2600 tries to force a win with black.} 44. Ne7+
Kg4 $4 {Unfortunately, this is much worse than a draw!} (44... Ke5 45. Ng6+ Kf5
46. Ne7+ {is automatically a draw, so Grandelius goes forward}) 45. Kf2 Rc1 46.
h3+ {unfortunately for the Swedish player, his king finds himself in a mating
net now.} Kf4 (46... Kh5 47. g4+ Kh4 48. Rxh6#) 47. Ng6+ {and he had to resign
due to Kf5 g4#} 1-0
