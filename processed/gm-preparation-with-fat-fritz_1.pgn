Re1 Nf5 { A powerful brute force engine remains contantly at 0.00 here. However, Fat Fritz hardly requires a second invitaiton to the feast here. Chess is of course 0.00 with perfect play. However, the practical chess played by humans is quite different to engine games played at a 3600 level. Humans have to solve problems that are incredibly complex within limited time. I don't think we'll ever get close to that level of perfection, and so I think chess will remain fun for a long time.} 24. Bg5 $1 hxg5 25. Nxg5 Qc8 26. Rf4 g6 27. g4 { [#] A very interesting position to study/ analyze with or without an engine.} Ne7 {The typical human response to pressure. Nils also had the added pressure of his team's position collapsing on the other boards. But even without external factors, defending this kind of a position against Adhiban is an unpleasant task for any human being.} (27... Ne3 28. e6 Qc6 $1 {This defence found by Stockfish is 'missed' by the NN engine. This actually has a rather useful practical point in the sense that the NN engine can indicate better what our human GM opponent is 'likely to miss' and set them complex practical problems.} (28...

Qg3 $40 {Fat Fritz thinks White has a rather strong attack, whilst Stockfish thinks that White is just winning.}) 29. exf7+ Kh8 {[#] The point. g6 needs to be defended. The position remains complex with engines unanimously agreeing on the universal evaluation '0.00' which humans have referred to as 'unclear' for decades before the introduction of the weird, but now accepted centipawn evaluation system.}) 28. Qg3 Kg7 29. Qh4 Rh8 30. Rxf7+ Kg8 31. Rh7 {A fine game. The last decade saw a huge difference in how we look at openings. With brute force engine showing everything as 0.00, it was considered that White has no objective advantage anymore and it is 0.00 everywhere. The aim with White was to 'just get a position' which doesn't immediately draw. While this is largely still true from a strictly objective vantage, from a practical point of view, with the emergence of NN engines, I believe White can lay claim to 'edges' once again. Until the next rotation of the cycle.} 1-0
