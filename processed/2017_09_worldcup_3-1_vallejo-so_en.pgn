1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. g4 {I am sure Wesley So was very happy to see
this move from his opponent. Usually with black you have to be very
solid. But if your opponent takes the game into an aggressive territory, then
you too get your chances.} Be4 5. f3 {Provoking f3 is often quite useful.} Bg6
6. h4 h5 7. e6 {I have faced this line quite a few times and have had a 100%
score with Black. I am unsure what Vallejo had in mind, because this is a fine
position for the second player.} Qd6 $1 {Of course the key move which Wesley
would know.} 8. exf7+ Bxf7 9. Be3 {is not played often. I think Vallejo just
wanted a new position.} (9. Ne2 {is the main line.} Nd7 10. Bf4 e5 11. dxe5
Nxe5 $17 {Black goes back Qc7 followed by Bd6 and he is completely fine.}) 9...
hxg4 (9... Qb4+ 10. Nd2 Qxb2 11. Rb1 $132) 10. fxg4 Nf6 11. Nc3 Qe6 $1 {
Double attack on e3 and g4.} 12. Kd2 (12. Qe2 Nxg4 13. Bg5 Qxe2+ 14. Bxe2 $13)
12... Nxg4 13. Bg5 Nf2 {When you have said A, you must say B, even if it is
bad.} 14. Qf3 Nxh1 15. Qxh1 Qd6 16. Bh3 e6 17. Rf1 Be7 18. Bf4 Qb4 $1 19. Nge2
Nd7 20. a3 Qxb2 21. Rb1 Qxa3 22. Rxb7 {Black is an exchange up and also has a
few extra pawns. White has just scored an own goal here.} Qa6 23. Qb1 Rxh4 24.
Bf1 Rxf4 $5 25. Nxf4 Qa5 26. Qe1 Bg5 27. Qg3 Bh6 28. Bd3 O-O-O $1 29. Rb3 e5
30. dxe5 d4 {Vallejo had had enough. It's not a good feeling to have both your
knights pinned to your king.} 0-1
