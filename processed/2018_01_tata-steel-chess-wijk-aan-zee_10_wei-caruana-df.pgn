1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Nd4 {Black had no truly adventurous
choices in any case, except the slightly odd 4...Bd6. Quite solid are the
well-known 4...d6 and 4...Bb4.} 5. Bc4 (5. Ba4 $5 {is the main line, trying to
prevent Black from playing ...d5 under favourable conditions. Play could
continue:} Bc5 $5 (5... Nxf3+ 6. Qxf3 Bc5 $11 {is stable equality, though
White has also tried the pawn recapture.}) 6. Nxe5 O-O 7. Nd3 Bb6 8. e5 Ne8 9.
Nd5 {Now see, for instance, Morozevich-Svidler, Thessaloniki 2013, or
Kasparov-Dominguez, Saint Louis 2017.}) 5... Bc5 6. d3 (6. Nxe5 Qe7 $1 {
is vaguely reminiscent of the Traxler Counter-Gambit and is in any case more
dangerous for White than Black.}) 6... d6 7. Na4 {Initiating large-scale
exchanges in a tried and tested manner.} (7. h3 {is most played, but seems a
little slow, especially since Black can just respond to Bg5/Nd5 ideas with a
laconic ...c6.}) 7... b5 8. Nxd4 bxc4 9. Nf5 Bxf5 10. exf5 cxd3 11. Nxc5 dxc5
12. cxd3 {So far following a source game from 2 years ago. What seems likely
is that central pawn exchanges will follow and then a draw.} Qd7 13. Qf3 O-O
14. O-O (14. Bg5 e4 15. dxe4 Nxe4 $11) 14... Rfd8 15. Be3 Qxd3 16. Rac1 {
To be honest with you, I doubt it makes much difference which rook White plays
with here.} (16. Rfc1 e4 17. Qg3 Qd5 18. Qxc7 Rac8 19. Qf4 $11 {was the source
game, maybe marginally more pleasant for Black but still ultimately agreed
drawn without much trouble. Maze,S-Fressinet,L Agen 2016}) 16... c4 17. h3 h6 (
17... e4 $11 {kept equality more easily.}) 18. Rc3 Qe4 (18... Qd5 $1 19. Qxd5
Nxd5 20. Rxc4 a5 $11 {keeps everything watertight}) 19. Qxe4 Nxe4 20. Rxc4 Nd2
21. Bxd2 Rxd2 22. Rb1 ({Black has made a few very minor inaccuracies, and now} 
22. Rxc7 $5 Rxb2 23. Re1 $1 Rxa2 24. Rxe5 $14 {might still make Black do a
little bit of work in an unpleasant 4-v-3 rook endgame}) 22... Rad8 23. Rxc7
Re2 $1 {The sacrificed pawns will return home.} 24. Rxa7 Rdd2 25. Rf1 Rxb2 26.
g4 Rxa2 27. Rxa2 Rxa2 28. Re1 {The draw was agreed here, none too soon.}
1/2-1/2
