1. d4
{Best by test, at least for me!} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 {
Much better known.} (4... Bxc3+ {My opponent had played this once which
made me choose this line with white.}) 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Nf3 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3
d6 8. O-O e5 {I must say that I have more experience playing the Huebner
Wall setup (c5-d6-e5) with black than white. But overall it is a rich
formation which can be worth playing from both sides.} 9. Nd2 $5 {The
modern approach. More normal is to play e4 followed by d5. Remember
the Spassky-Fischer 1972 match?!!} O-O $6 10. Rb1 {White tries to make
as many useful moves as possible before clarifying the situation in
the center.} cxd4 {A slightly premature release in the center. It would
have been much better to play the waiting game with the move b6.} (10...
b6 $5) 11. cxd4 exd4 12. exd4 Nxd4 $6 {This is just crossing the limits,
opening up the position to the maximum for the opponent's bishops. A
pawn is a small price to pay for that.} (12... d5 {is relatively better
but here too White keeps an edge.}) 13. Ne4 $1 Nxe4 (13... Bf5 $5 {This
could be a good defence.} 14. Nxf6+ (14. Bg5 Bxe4 15. Bxe4 Ne6 $11)
(14. Ng3 Bxd3 15. Qxd3 $14) 14... Qxf6 15. Bb2 Qg6 $1 $15) (13... Ne6
14. Nxd6 $16) 14. Bxe4 {Two bishops on an open board and a lonely black
king in the corner! Things do not looks so great for Black.} Ne6 15.
Qh5 h6 $2 (15... f5 16. Bd5 $1 (16. Bxf5 $6 g6 17. Bxe6+ Bxe6 {gives
Black some chances to defend although in the ensuing opposite coloured
bishop position White has the better attacking chances.}) 16... Kh8
17. Re1 $40 {With a strong attack.}) (15... g6 16. Qh6 {It looks scary
to weaken the dark squares but was the lesser evil.}) {[#]} 16. Bxh6
$1 { Of course this is as natural as a baby's smile, but I had to calculate
a few details before playing it.} gxh6 17. Qxh6 Ng5 {This was the move
that my opponent was banking on, but I had seen a bit further.} (17...
f5 18. Qg6+ $1 ( 18. Bd5 $2 Qf6 $15) 18... Kh8 19. Bxb7 $1 {A nice little
move that wins the house.} (19. Rb3 Qh4 $1) 19... Bxb7 20. Qh6+ $1 Kg8
21. Qxe6+ (21. Rxb7 { is stronger.}) 21... Rf7 22. Rxb7 $18) 18. Rb5
$1 {Rb3 is easy to see but fifth rank lifts are not so common. My opponent
was surprised to see this move and rest of his time was spent on kicking
himself for missing it.} f5 (18... Nxe4 19. Rh5 $18 {With a forced mate
either on h7 or h8 is the neat point.}) 19. Bd5+ Rf7 (19... Ne6 20.
Bxe6+ Bxe6 21. Qxe6+ Rf7 22. Rxb7 $18) 20. Re1 $1 { A silent move that
shows how helpless Black is. My opponent thought for a while before
stretching his hand out in resignation. It is always a nice feeling
to win your game in twenty moves!} (20. f4 Ne6 21. Rf3 $5 {A nice idea
suggested by Sasikiran when we were casually discussing the game (without
a board).} (21. Bxe6 Bxe6 22. Qxe6 Qd7 23. Qg6+ Rg7 24. Qxf5 Qxf5 25.
Rxf5 $18 { is the boring long way to win.}) 21... Qe7 (21... Rh7 $1
{The best defence which forces White to take on e6.}) 22. Rg3+ Rg7 23.
Rbb3 $1 $18 {A nice idea by Sasi. There is no way to deal with Rxg7
followed by Rg3.}) (20. Re1 a6 ( 20... Bd7 21. Rxb7 {[%cal Gb7d7,Gd5a8]})
