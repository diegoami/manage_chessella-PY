Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. g3 Bg7 6. Bg2 Nxc3 7. bxc3 c5 8. e3 Qa5 9. Bd2 O-O 10. Nh3 $5 $146 {Gunina made this move in just 21 seconds, which clearly meant that she had come prepared for the line.} Nc6 11. f4 $5 Qc7 12. Nf2 e6 13. h4 $5 {[%csl Gc3,Gd4,Ge3,Gf4,Gg3,Gh4] Just imagine that the light squared bishops are off the board - Black would be clearly better. This is the reason why Petra gets her bishop to b7 with her next move.} b6 14. h5 Bb7 15. hxg6 fxg6 $6 (15... hxg6 $1 $15 {looks risky but it's not easy for White to make use of the h-file. Black should be totally fine here.}) 16. Qg4 Rae8 17. Ne4 cxd4 18. cxd4 e5 $6 {Petra clearly understands that she should be getting to the white king who is sitting pretty in the center. However, she misses a strong tactical stroke by Gunina.} 19. Rxh7 $3 Nxd4 (19... Kxh7 20. Ng5+ Kg8 (20... Kh8 21. Qh4+ Kg8 22. Qh7#) 21. Bd5+ Rf7 22. Bxf7+ $18) 20. Rc1 $1 (20. exd4 $2 exf4 $17) 20... Qe7 (20... Qf7 21. Nd6 $18) 21. Qxg6 Qf7 (21... exf4 22. Ng5 $1 {The threat of Rh8+ followed by Qh7# is decisive.}) 22. Rxg7+ Qxg7 23. Qxg7+ Kxg7 24. Rc7+ Rf7 25. Nd6 $1 Ree7 26. Rxb7 Rxb7 27. exd4 exf4 28. Bxb7 Rd7 29. Bxf4 {A very interesting and fighting game with a sparkling finish by Gunina.} 1-0
