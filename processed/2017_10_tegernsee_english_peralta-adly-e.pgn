20. fxe5 $6 (20. f5 {is the typical move in such positions. After 20.f5 the
engines, in fact, do not like Black's position. And the human eye is also
worried about Black's king. After all, the h-pawn should be on h7, not on h5.}

21. Qf4 Rxg5 $1 {[#] If you are a Benoni-player you love to play such a move.
It is the black-squared bishop who keeps White's position together and usually
it is more than okay to give an exchange to get rid of it.} 22. Qxg5 Bd7 23.
Qf4 Be8 24. Qf2 Na6 25. d6 {The pawn on d6 looks as if it could spell trouble
for Black and Adly tries to play around it.} Bc6 26. Bf3 Bxf3 27. Qxf3 Qd7 28.

winning. If Black wants to stop the d-pawn he has to give the pawn on b5.} Rd8

been better to keep the pawn on d6 where White can defend it more easily.} (36.

Black's knight to e5 - the ideal square for the knight.} Ne5 39. Nb6 Kf6 40.
Rb7 Ke6 {[#] The time-control reachad and Black has a firm grip on the
position. Adly now shows good technique to win the game and the tournament.}
