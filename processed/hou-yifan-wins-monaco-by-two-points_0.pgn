Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nd7 4. O-O a6 5. Bd3 Ngf6 6. c4 {The main moves here are 6.c3 and 6.Re1. This move 6.c4 has just been played in one game before. So it can be assumed that Mariya wanted an original, non-theoretical game.} g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Re1 Ng4 $1 {A very important move by Hou Yifan. It is necessary to stop White's idea of Bf1 followed by d2-d4.} (8... O-O {looks pretty normal, but allows White to go for d4 with} 9. Bf1 {[%cal Gd2d4]}) 9. Bf1 Nge5 10. d3 O-O 11. Be3 {[%cal Gd7e5,Ge5c6,Re7e5,Ye5f3]} Nxf3+ $1 {With the clear idea to clamp down on the d4 square.} 12. Qxf3 Ne5 13. Qd1 Nc6 $1 { [%cal Gg7d4,Gc6d4] The knight has rerouted itself wonderfully to control the d4 square.} 14. Qd2 Rb8 15. Ne2 e5 $5 {Prevent d4 at all costs.} 16. Nc3 Be6 17. Nd5 b5 {Black's position is just so easy to play with breaks on both wings - b5 and f5.} 18. b3 ({After the game Mariya said that playing 18.b3 was the critical mistake and insted she should have preferred Rab1.} 18. Rab1) 18... f5 19. g3 $2 (19. exf5 gxf5 20. Rac1 $15 {would have left White with an inferior but playable position as f4 is currently not possible due to Bxf4 and e6 bishop is hanging.}) 19... f4 $1 {Alert as ever, Hou Yifan doesn't let such chances pass by.} 20. gxf4 exf4 21. Nxf4 {Of course Mariya had calculated till this point but missed her opponent's strong reply.} Bg4 $1 {The rook on a1 is hanging, the knight is coming to e5, rook on f8 is perfect and the queen will powerfully land on h4. All in all a completely lost position for White.} 22. Bg2 Ne5 23. h3 Nf3+ 24. Bxf3 Bxf3 25. Ne6 (25. Ne2 Qh4 26. Kh2 Be5+ 27. Ng3 Bg4 $19) 25... Qh4 26. Ng5 h6 $1 {Very accurate. The rook on a1 is unimportant.} 27. Nxf3 Rxf3 28. d4 Rxh3 29. Kf1 Qg4 {A beautifully played game by Hou Yifan who gave absolutely no chances to her opponent.} 0-1
