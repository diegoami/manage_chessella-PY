fought game featuring interesting preparation and good technique.} 1. d4 Nf6 2.

get a Russian variation, on which some very brief comments and game links
follow.} dxc4 6. Qxc4 O-O 7. e4 (7. Bf4 c6 8. e4 b5 {is, of course, another
main line, and now ...Qa5 against either Qd3 or Qb3 (the latter being now
viewed as better.)} 9. Qb3 (9. Qd3 Qa5) 9... Qa5 {One particularly noteworthy

sacrifice the c7 pawn in case of Bf4.} 8. Bf4 (8. e5 b5 9. Qb3 Nfd7 10. Be2 {

preference.}) 8. Be2 (8. Qb3 $5 {The move the hand wants to play; Black has to

the only, way to sensibly prevent the doubling.} (9... e6 {is main;} 10. Bxa6 (

but could just be a move-order device; Black barely ever wants the Rf8 to move
anywhere other than e8.}) 12. Bf4 Bd7 $6 {Has less to do with the centre than
Black might like. Clearly this is preparation, but it does not seem that
venomous.} (12... Bf5 13. Rad1 {is the main line, and now} Ne4 $1 (13... Qb6

A good reaction; White uses the idea mentioned before and 'hints' at Bxa6 (and
also, of course, Qxb7 and Nd2-c4.)} (13. Ne5 {It doesn't take a genius to work
out that this must have been in Black's preparation: a central, dominating

could the intention have been? Maybe} Qb6 $5 (13... b5 $5 14. Nxb5 Bxb5 15.

White idea; however, his problem is that White now begins to play flawless
chess.} (21... Nc2 $5 22. Re5 $5 {was probably what Black noticed and tried to

an engine, it would be impossible to notice that Black is essentially getting
