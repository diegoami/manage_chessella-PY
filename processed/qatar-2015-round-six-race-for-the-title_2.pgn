gain space with f4 as well as h4.} Nd4 20. Na5 $1 {The knight is coming to c4
and the d4 knight can be kicked away at some point with c3.} Nc6 21. Nc4 Qc7
22. Ne3 {[%csl Gd5][%cal Gb3a5,Ga5c4,Gc4e3] You can see how the knight made its
route from b3-a5-c4-e3 and is now looking at the juicy hole on d5.} (22. Nxd6
