Gg1,Gh1] Diagram [#] Look at the position after 12 moves! None of Giri's pieces
have been developed and Black has nearly four of them playing. Yet White is
doing okay, mainly because he has no weaknesses.} 13. Ne2 Bf5 14. b4 $5 {Highly
ambitious play. Anish hasn't completed his development but finds time to push
another pawn!} a5 15. Nc3 Qe6 16. b5 Ne5 17. Nxe4 $1 {Making a move like Nxe4
requires a lot of belief in your calculating abilities. f3 and d3 is coming up
and hence Black doesn't have a good discovery.} Nd7 18. d3 Bxe4 19. dxe4 Nc5
20. Bb2 Rad8 21. Rc1 $6 (21. f3 $5 {Would have retained an advantage for White
as now Be2 followed by 0-0 is coming up and there is no real good way for Black
to take advantage of his lead in development.} f5 $2 22. Qc3 $1 $18) 21... Nxe4
22. Bd3 Nxf2 $1 {A fine shot which puts the ball back in the Dutch GM's court.
What does he do now?} 23. Bxh7+ (23. Kxf2 $2 Qxe3+ $19 {[%cal Gd8d3]}) (23.

pinned his hopes. Black has only way to wriggle out of the mess but
unfortunately is unable to find it.} Nd3 $2 (24... Ng4 $1 { would have given
Black an equal position. But this is far from easy to calculate.} 25. Rf3 (25.

check is difficult to prevent.} Kg8 28. Rcf1 Qe2 29. Qc4 $1 Rd7 30. Rg6+ {A
very interesting battle but it must be said that the Dutch super GM was surely
given a scare by his young Indian opponent.} 1-0
