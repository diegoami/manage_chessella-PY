1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Qb6 {I played this sideline a lot in the
past. It seemed like a good idea to give an unusual twist to known Scheveningen
structures. The point is to drive the white knight away from the center at the
cost of losing some time on the extra queen move} 5. Nb3 Nf6 6. Nc3 e6 7. Qe2
$5 {A popular choice among the numerous English Attack devotees. I had faced it
against Mickey Adams and Ray Robson.} Bb4 $5 {I have always preferred this
move} ({to the standard} 7... d6 8. g4) 8. Bd2 O-O 9. a3 Be7 $1 10. Be3 (10. e5
{is answered by the somewhat surprising} Nd5 $1 {where the absence of white
major pieces from the d-file allows Black the time to undouble the pawns.
Adams-Yermolinsky, World Championship KO, New Delhi 2000 went} 11. O-O-O d6 12.
exd6 Bxd6 13. g3 Be5 14. Nxd5 exd5 {Two things seemed obvious to me at this
moment of the game: Black must play a7-a5 quick to generate threats, and
White's Be3 is always answered by d5-d4.}) ({Not much different is the other
move order:} 10. O-O-O d5 11. Be3 Qc7 12. exd5 Nxd5 13. Nxd5 exd5 {was
Robson-Yermolinsky, US Championship 2010}) 10... Qc7 11. f4 { This is a
different concept. White wants to close the center.} d5 12. e5 Nd7 { [#] The
resulting pawn structure is nothing new, we get it from the Classical Steinitz
French. There are some minor details though. The White knight is way from d4,
so usual defensive plans based on exchanging pieces aren't available. Instead
Black may try for f7-f6. Also the white queen blocks her own bishop, so
Sevian's next move attempts to take care of both problems.} 13. Qg4 $5 { An
ambitious move from an ambitious player.} ({Previously known was} 13. Nb5 Qb8
14. O-O-O {where Black absolutely must strike in the center with} f6 $1 ({
instead of the meek} 14... a6 15. N5d4 Nc5 16. Kb1 $14) 15. exf6 Nxf6 {seeking
further complications after} 16. Kb1 e5) 13... b6 14. Bb5 $5 {An interesting
idea to establish the control of the d4-square.} Nc5 ({During the game I
considered} 14... a6 15. Bxc6 Qxc6 16. Nd4 Qc4 17. Nxe6 {dangerous for Black.
Now I can see that after} fxe6 18. Qxe6+ Rf7 19. Nxd5 Bh4+ $1 20. g3 Qxc2 { it
can go both ways.}) 15. Nd4 Nxd4 16. Bxd4 f5 {I felt obliged to secure my
king.} (16... Ba6 17. Bxa6 Nxa6 18. O-O-O {and White aims for an attack with
f4-f5.}) 17. Qh3 Ne4 18. O-O Bc5 $6 {Possibly a mistake, as later I realized I
cannot trade the light-squared bishops with my knight on the board.} (18... Bd7
19. Bd3 Nxc3 20. bxc3 Bc5 {would have been roughly equal.}) 19. Ne2 a5 20. Qe3
Bd7 {Change of plans.} (20... Ba6 21. Bd3 $1 a4 22. Rac1 {and with his
queenside secure White can now think of g2-g4, albeit his advantage is very
small.}) 21. Bd3 Rfc8 22. Rac1 {Threatening c2-c4. That's what happens when
f7-f5 makes the e6-pawn weak.} b5 23. Bxe4 fxe4 (23... dxe4 24. Bxc5 Qxc5 25.
Qxc5 Rxc5 26. Rfd1 {clearly in White's favor.}) 24. c3 Be7 25. g4 Rf8 26. Ng3

({Not so good for him was} 29. gxh5 Qe7 30. Kh1 (30. Rc2 Rf5 31. Qg4 Bg5 $1 {is
one fine point. When the bishop gets to h6 it'll play important roles in both
attack and defense.}) 30... Rf5 31. Qg4 Raf8 32. b4 axb4 33. axb4 Qd8 34. Rg1
R8f7 {appeared very safe to me.}) 29... Bg6 30. Rf2 Qc4 {From this point to the
end of the game I played on the increment alone. In such situations one must
counterattack or at least bother the opponent with some threats. I have learned
this much from a lifetime of playing the Sicilian.} (30... b4 {I rejected on
account of} 31. axb4 axb4 32. Qg5 {but there was a nice defensive idea I failed
to consider:} Ra6 $1 {and White cannot yet go} 33. f5 exf5 34. gxf5 {because
of} Bxf5 $1 35. Rxf5 Rg6) 31. Re1 Qd3 32. Re3 Qb1+ 33. Kg2 h6 { So I got my
queen in and managed to stop White's intended Qg5.} 34. h3 $6 { Some hesitation
from Sam, both on the board and the clock.} (34. Qe7 Rfe8 35. Qd7 b4 36. f5

forward. Black needs to open a file for his rook to give his active queen some
support.} 35. Qe7 bxa3 36. bxa3 (36. Qxe6+ $2 Bf7 37. Qd6 a2) ({Possibly} 36.

felt quite good about my chances.} 37. Qh4 {[#]} Rf8 {but soon I realized I had
to repeat.} ({The thing is,} 37... Rab8 38. f5 Qd1 { is a nice counterattack,
but Black is only playing for a draw.} 39. fxg6 Rb1 40. Kg3 Qg1+ (40... Qh1

improvement in sight.}) 41... gxf6 42. exf6 Qg1+ ( 42... Rg1+ 43. Kh4) 43. Rg2

criticize the players for losing their precision in time trouble.} ({Truth to
tell, the objectively best} 42. gxf5 Bh5 43. Qc2 Bf3+ 44. Rexf3 exf3+ 45. Kxf3

that one.} ({I thought} 43... Qb7 {was my only defense, and panicked when I

Rxg7+ Kf8 48. hxg4 $11) 46... gxh3 {is totally fine for Black. This mistake and
some others that eventually cost me this game can be explained by my lack of
practice playing on the increment. With only 30 seconds left per move one has
to trust his intuition more. Instead, I was calculating as hard as I could and
then had to play a move before I was able to get to the end of my lines.}) 44.
