Be3 {15 This is a pet line of Rodshtein, and one he played at the Olympiad just recently, defeating GM Saric.} Nc5 {27} (9... Nd7 10. a3 Nb6 11. Rg1 Bd7 12. h4 Nc5 13. b3 Kh8 14. g5 f6 15.

Black has played successfully, and almost with equal frequency, 11...a4, 11...Bd7 as in the game, as well as ... cxd5 and ...Nfd7, or ...Ne8.} 12. g5 {456} Ne8 {147} 13. Nb3 {1275 Had White forgotten his theory here? It isn't that 13.Nb3 is not played, but it is almost never chosen in grandmaster play. Rodshtein spent over 21 minutes before playing this. Normal is 13.h4. Perhaps he felt this was the time to step out of the main lines, fearing Naiditsch's preparation.} cxd5 {1241} 14. exd5 {765} Na4 {321} 15. Nd2 {45} Nxc3 {75} 16. bxc3 {4 [#]} f5 $1 {90 With White's king still in the center, and both his queenside and kingside badly weakened, it is tome to start the counterattack.} 17. gxf6 {54} Bxf6 {835} 18.

Rg5 {530} e3 $2 {190 A mistake in move order that could have cost the win, but Black's aggressive and enterprising play will be rewarded. Correct was ...Qc2 first and only then ...e3.} 28. fxe3 {6} Qc2 {12} 29. Qd4 {132} f4 {232} 30. Rxb7 $2 {48 White hallucinates and it is over. The move was Qxf4 plain and simple.} fxe3 {58} 31.
