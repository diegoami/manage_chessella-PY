Two of the best players of the modern era faced off against each other in the third round of the ETCC 2015.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 {Carlsen doesn't want to dip his feet in Berlin endgames.} Bc5 5. O-O Nd4 6. Nxd4 Bxd4 {This is a main line with more than 260 games played in it.} 7. c3 Bb6 8. Na3 c6 9. Ba4 d6 10. Bb3 {A move that Levon had not seen. According to him White first plays Nc4 and only then decides about his bishop. Now that he was given a chance he decided to keep the bishop on g1-a7 diagonal.} a5 11. Nc4 Ba7 {Caruana had retreated his bishop to c7 against Karjakin, but Levon has his own ideas.} 12. a4 O-O 13. Bg5 h6 14. Bxf6 {Carlsen goes for this exchange as he sees the possibility of winning the a5 pawn.} (14. Bh4 $5 g5 15. Bg3 Be6 {is another interesting position.}) 14... Qxf6 15. Nxa5 {This is pretty greedy. And the problem is that after the move d6-d5 Black is able to trap the white knight on a5.} d5 $1 16. Bc2 {The bishop makes way for the knight to come to b3 but now the pace of the game increases and Magnus finds it difficult to keep control with his knight on a5.} (16. exd5 cxd5 17. Bxd5 Qd8 $1 18. Bxb7 Bxb7 19. Nxb7 Qc7 $15) 16... dxe4 17. dxe4 Rd8 18. Qe1 (18. Qf3 Qxf3 19. gxf3 Rd2 20. Rac1 Bh3 (20... Be6 $5 {is also strong.} ) 21. Nc4 Rad8 22. Rcd1 Bxf2+ 23. Kh1 Bxf1 24. Rxd2 Rxd2 25. Nxd2 Be2 26. Bb3 Be3 27. Bc4 Bd1 28. Bb3 $11 {This forced, long and complicated variation was rattled out by Aronian after the game.}) (18. Qe2 {looks pretty natural, but I guess Magnus was afraid of something like Qg5 followed by Bg4.}) 18... Qg5 19. Kh1 Rd2 20. Bd1 Be6 (20... Rxb2 21. Nc4 $16) 21. b4 (21. Nb3 Rxb2 $19) 21... Rad8 22. Nxb7 $2 {This is just too greedy. Better was} (22. Be2 {But even here it is not so easy to wriggle out for White.}) (22. Bb3 {is the most natural move but is beautifully refuted by} Bh3 23. gxh3 Qf4 {The threat is simply Qf3 followed by Rook to d6 and a mate.} 24. Nc4 R8d3 $3 (24... Qf3+ 25. Kg1 R8d6 26. Nxe5 $16 {White is alive and kicking.} (26. Nxd6 Rxd6 $19)) 25. Qxd2 (25. Nxd2 Rxh3 $19) 25... Rxd2 26. Nxd2 Qxd2 $17 {Black is almost winning here. What a wonderful piece of calculation by Aronian.}) 22... Bc4 $1 23. Nxd8 Bxf1 24. Qxf1 Rxf2 {Black is a piece down, but there is mate threatened on h2 and the white pieces are completely scattered.} 25. Qg1 Ra2 $1 26. Rxa2 (26. Qf1 Rxa1 $19) ({According to Levon, Magnus must have wanted to play this move but must have missed the check on g1.} 26. Bb3 Qxg2+ $1 27. Qxg2 Rxa1+ 28. Qf1 Rxf1+ 29. Kg2 {and now the check on g1 is very important. Any other move and White can still survive.} Rg1+ $1 30. Kf3 Rc1 {and now the c3 pawn falls with a check.}) 26... Bxg1 27. Kxg1 Qc1 (27... Qxd8 $19 {was also winning.}) 28. Kf2 Qxd1 29. Nxc6 Qb3 30. Rd2 Qxc3 {This is not so difficult for Aronian to convert into a full point.} 31. Rd6 Qb2+ 32. Ke3 Qa3+ 33. Kf2 Qxa4 34. Nxe5 Qc2+ 35. Kf3 f5 36. Rd3 fxe4+ 37. Kxe4 Qxg2+ 38. Nf3 Qg4+ 39. Ke3 g5 40. Kf2 Qf5 41. Rd8+ Kg7 42. Kg2 g4 43. Nd2 Qe6 44. Nf1 Qc6+ 0-1
