Qb3 Qc8 9. Nh4 $1 {At the first possible opportunity Kramnik goes ahead to
create an imbalance. Once he achieves that he will have much easier task in
outplaying his opponent.} Bg6 (9... Be4 $5 10. f3 Bg6 11. Nxg6 hxg6 {should
have been considered. The move f3 doesn't do anything constructive to White's
position.}) 10. Nxg6 hxg6 11. Bd3 Nh5 12. Be3 Bd6 13. O-O-O a6 14. Kb1 b5 15.
Qc2 Na5 (15... Nf4 16. Bf1) 16. Nf3 Nc4 17. Bc1 $1 {First this bishop retreats
to its initial square and after a few moves the other one also retreats!} Qc7
18. Ng5 Nf4 19. Bf1 $1 {Quite a picturesque position. Both bishops on their
initial squares.} O-O-O $6 {A bad decision by Sanan whose king is not at all
safe on the queenside. Kramnik must have been glad to see the sight of 0-0-0.}
20. a4 Qb7 21. axb5 axb5 22. b3 Na5 (22... Na3+ 23. Bxa3 Bxa3 24. g3 Nh5 25. b4
$16 {And the bishop on a3 has come too far from home.}) 23. Qa2 Nc6 24. g3 Nh5
25. Bd3 Kb8 26. Qe2 Na7 27. Bd2 Rc8 28. Kb2 Rc6 29. Ra1 Rf8 30. Ra2 Ra6 31.
Rxa6 Qxa6 32. Ra1 {By methodical play Kramnik has got everything in his favour.
The bishops are wonderful defenders and at the same time attacking the black
queenside and the rook has controlled the open a-file.} Qb7 33. b4 Nf6 34. Ra5
Bc7 35. Bf4 Bxf4 36. gxf4 Qc7 37. Bxb5 Qxf4 38. Nf3 Ne4 39. Ne5 {The knight,
bishop, rook, and queen will launch a deadly attack against the black king.}
Rh8 40. Nc6+ Nxc6 41. Bxc6 Nxc3 $5 {A desperate attempt to complicate the
position. But Kramnik is alert and upto the mark.} 42. Kxc3 Rh3+ 43. Kc2 Qxd4
44. Qb5+ Kc7 45. Qb7+ Kd6 46. Qb8+ (46. Rxd5+ $1 exd5 47. Qd7+ Ke5 48. Qxh3 $18
{was another way to win.}) 46... Ke7 47. Qa7+ Qxa7 48. Rxa7+ Kd6 49. Ba4 Rh4 (
49... Rxh2 50. Rd7+ Ke5 51. Rxf7 $18) 50. Kb3 Rh3+ 51. Kb2 Rh4 (51... e5 52.
Rxf7 Rxh2 53. Kc3 Ke6 54. Rxg7 Rxf2 55. Rxg6+ Kf5 56. Rd6 $18) 52. Rd7+ Ke5 53.
Ka3 Kd4 54. Rxf7 Rxh2 55. b5 Kc5 56. Rc7+ {A great game by Vladimir but it must
be said that Sanan made his task considerably easier when he castled long. }
