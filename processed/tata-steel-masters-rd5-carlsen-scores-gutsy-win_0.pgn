1. d4  Nf6  2. c4  g6  3. Nc3  d5 {(0s) A Gruenfeld! Who would have thought it?
Van Wely clearly hadn't as he sunk into thought for a full five minutes.} 4.

10. Bg3  Bxa2  11. Ne2  ({A number of spectators were concerned that after} 11.
b3 { the bishop would be caught. However Carlsen pointed out that} Qd5 {would
solve this, and the risk of an early loss would evaporate.}) 11... Bd5  12. Nc3
 Bc6 {[#] (195s)} 13. h4 $5 {(53s) A move that caught Carlsen by surprise, but
that he did not condemn after the game.} Rd8  14. Qb3  Qf5  15. h5  e6  16.

 19. Kf1  Nf6  20. Be5  Rac8  21. Qd2  Ng4  22. Bxg7  Kxg7  23. f3 {[#] (86s)
At this point, Loek Van Wely was incredibly short of time with nearly 20 moves
to go. Choosing to exploit this, Magnus Carlsen does not try to race his
opponent, but instead give him the biggest difficulties imaginable.} Qg5 $5

Rxg2 {(65s) This queen infiltrtion could easily have brought the World No. 1 a
lot of grief.} 28. Qh6+  Kf6 {[#] (1s) Obviously, it is exceptionally hard to
find the right moves when one has only 30 seconds left on the clock.} 29. Rc3
