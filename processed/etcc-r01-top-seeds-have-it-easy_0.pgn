Nf3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bg5 Nbd7 6. e3 Qa5 {The famous Cambridge Springs Variation.} 7. cxd5 (7. Nd2 {is the main line.}) 7... Nxd5 8. Rc1 Nxc3 9. bxc3 Ba3 (9... Qxa2 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. O-O $44 {gives White excellent lead in development.}) 10. Rc2 b6 11. Be2 Ba6 12. O-O Bxe2 {All this has been played in nine games before and top players like Carlsen, Ding and Tomashevsky himself had captured on e2 with the queen. But here Evgeny had a novelty up his sleeve!} 13. Rxe2 $5 $146 O-O (13... Qxc3 14. Rc2 Qa5 15. Rxc6 $16) 14. e4 {Tomashevsky would like to keep his rook on e3 to defend the c3 pawn and swing over to the kingside whenever required.} Rfe8 (14... Qxc3 15. Rc2 Qa5 16. Rxc6 Rac8 {could be something that can be explored by black players.}) 15. Re3 { Played after 25 minutes of thought. This is very common for Tomashevsky, who takes a lot of time for complicated decisions in the opening.} Bf8 16. e5 $5 Qxa2 {This is a very interesting situation. Black has won a pawn on a2 but White has good attacking chances. His idea is to play Nd2-e4 followed by queen coming out to g4 or h5 and the rook swinging over to g3 or h3. Computers assess such positions in Black's favour, but practically during a game it is very difficult to defend. In fact in this particular position I would say that White has an extremely strong attack.} 17. Nd2 {[%cal Gd2e4,Ge3h3,Ge3g3,Gd1g4, Gg4h5]} c5 18. Ne4 cxd4 19. cxd4 Rac8 20. Qg4 $6 ({Much more accurate was} 20. Rh3 {threatening Qh5.} g6 21. Qf3 $1 Qd5 22. Qf4 $18 {[%csl Ge4,Gf4,Gg5,Gh3] With these four pieces in the attack Black can just pray that some divine power will save him. But in reality he is dead lost.}) 20... Rc4 21. Rf3 Rxd4 22. Qf4 Ra8 $2 (22... Nxe5 23. Qxe5 Qc4 {would have given Black realistic chances of defence.}) 23. Qxf7+ Kh8 {[#]} 24. Bf6 $3 {The move that Ipatov most probably missed â€“and it is the only move that wins! The threat is Rg3.} Rxe4 (24... gxf6 25. Rg3 $18) 25. Rg3 Nxf6 26. exf6 g6 27. Rh3 h6 28. Qxg6 Qd2 29. Qxe4 (29. Rg3 $1) 29... Rc8 30. Rd3 Qc2 31. Qxe6 Qc6 32. Qg4 Rc7 33. Qg6 Qe6 34. Rd8 {A very nice attacking game by Tomashevsky. His idea of taking on e2 with the rook and then following it up with Re3 and then e5, Nd2-e4, Qg4 and finally crowning his attack with the pretty Bf6! led to a very consistent game.} 1-0
