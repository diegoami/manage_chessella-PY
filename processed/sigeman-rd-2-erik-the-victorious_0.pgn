Nd2 $5 {Erik has predominantly preferred 3.Nc3 in the past, however, since 2017 he has exclusively used this move.} Be7 4. e5 $1 (4. Ngf3 Nf6 5. Bd3 c5 6. e5 Nfd7 7. c3 Nc6 8. O-O g5 9. dxc5 {was how the previous game of Erik had went in this variation against Libiszewski in 2015. Pavel had probably prepared something here.}) 4... c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. Bd3 h5 7. Ndf3 {The mainline after 4.e5, yet Pavel sank into thought for about 30 minutes here.} Bd7 8. Ne2 {[%csl Ge2,Gf3] Of course, as is obvious, the placement of knights on f3,e2 as opposed to f3,d2 protects the important strategic point d4 much more securely. The position seems much more pleasant for White.} cxd4 9. cxd4 (9. Nexd4 Nh6 10. Qe2 {is preferred by the computer. I am guessing that the reason is to not allow Nb4 and the subsequent activation of the light square bishop.}) 9... Nb4 10. Bb1 Bb5 11. O-O Rc8 12. Re1 g5 13. Nc3 Ba6 14. Qa4+ $2 (14. Be3 $142 Nc6 15.

Nc5 Bxc5 $2 {The decisive mistake. With Black's pawn formation, the dark square bishop is the only protector. Exchanging it is like Daenerys trading one of her dragons.} 23. Na4 $1 Qc6 24. Nxc5 b6 25. Bxh6 Rxh6 26. b3 {leads to a safe pawn up, but I guess Nd3 was more technically accurate. } (26. Nd3 Qa8 27. Nf4 {[%csl Rh6][%cal Ra3f8,Rh4d8,Gd1d3,Gd3g3,Gg3h4,Gd3a3] would've been a huge strategic advantage. Imagine White's Queen on h4/g5. The c-file is the 'second front' and the a3-f8 diagonal is also a possible opening. }) 26... bxc5 27. bxc4 Rg6 28. cxd5 Qxd5 29. Qa4+ Kf8 30. dxc5 h4 31. Red1 $1 { impressive move, nipping Black's counter-play in the bud.} Qxe5 {The Queen had to be moved from the a8-h1 diagonal, and Black's counter-play is extinguished.} 32. c6 Kg7 33. Qxa7 g3 34.
