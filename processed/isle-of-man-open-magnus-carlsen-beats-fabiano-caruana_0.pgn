researched} 10. axb5 axb5 11. Na3 O-O 12. Nxb5 Bg4 13. Bc2 exd4 14. Nbxd4 Nxd4
15. cxd4 Bxf3 16. gxf3 Nh5 17. Kh1 Qf6 18. Be3 {Magnus tried to defend Black's
colors against Karjakin (game 9 in New York) and it almost cost him his title,
as Sergey was close to building a two-point lead. On the other hand, having
played the Bc5 variation on numerous occasions himself as Black, Fabiano must
be quite well-versed in the intricacies of that line. Lots of psychology there
- who made the right choice of the opening?}) 10... Ba7 ({It is now common
knowledge that} 10... Nxa5 {is soundly refuted by} 11. Rxa5 $1 Bxa5 12. dxe5

13. Nbd2) 13... h6 14. Nbd2 Re8 {Black just holds his center and asks what's
next.} (14... exd4 15. cxd4 Nb4 16. e5 {was seen in yesterday's game Caruana
(!)-Jones. Naturally, Carlsen didn't feel like repeating it.}) 15. g4 {It's
Caruana with a novelty!} ({From the other side of the board Fabiano had seen it
all:} 15. Nf1 exd4 16. cxd4 Rxe4 17. Ng3 Re7 18. Qd2 Qf8 19. Reb1 Bd7 20. Nh4

15... Qe7 {Facing preparation, Magnus wisely stays on the side of caution.} ({
From the first glance} 15... exd4 16. cxd4 Nb4 17. g5 $5 {looks dangerous for
Black, but there's an incredible resource} c5 $3 {that can turn the tables in a
hurry.}) ({Of course,} 15... Bb7 $2 {allows White to realize his main idea:}

interesting was} 18. Bd5 $5 {not a standard move in they Ruy Lopez, but fully
justified here because of the odd position of Nd8.} Nxd5 (18... Rb8 19. dxe5

for White.}) 19. exd5 f6 20. dxc5 Bxc5 21. Nh4 $14) 18... c4 $1 19. Bc2 Nh7 20.
b4 $1 {True to both his uncompromising style and the demands of the tournament
situation Caruana paints with broad strokes, using the entire board. } cxb3 $5
{A no-yield decision characteristic of Carlsen approach to his first "after Bu"
tournament. He takes a huge risk, not willing to accept a passive position.}
21. Bxb3 Be6 22. Bc2 $2 {Oh, no. A sudden change of heart from Fabiano that
ultimately cost him the game.} ({There's only one way to handle this position,
and it's to go forward!} 22. Nf5 Bxf5 (22... Qc7 23. Bd5 $1) 23. exf5 Qb7 24.
Nh4 {Granted, it doesn't look so clear, but Bxh6 is going to be played soon,
and Magnus would have had problems with his king, which is arguably the only
way to defeat him these days.}) 22... Rc8 23. Bd3 Nb7 24. Rec1 $2 (24. Nf5 Bxf5
25. gxf5 Qc7 26. Ra3 {was called for. I wonder if Carlsen would be satisfied
with a draw after a possible repetition,} Qe7 { intending d6-d5} 27. Raa1 Qc7
{etc. Otherwise, White would go Kh1 and Rg1.}) 24... Qd8 25. Qb2 ({The only way
to deal with a loss of the a-pawn was} 25. d5 Bxe3 26. Qxe3 Bd7 27. c4 Nxa5 28.
cxb5 Rxc1+ 29. Rxc1 axb5 {where White obviously puts his attacking ambitions to
rest, but he should be able to win back the b-pawn and coast to a draw, e.g.}

25... Nxa5 $1 {Hey, why not? Magnus has a supreme confidence in his ability to
handle complications.} 26. Nd2 d5 $1 {A thematic strike in the center,
well-timed to White's pieces departure from the key squares} 27. Re1 (27. exd5

resolute} g6 $1 29. Nxh6+ Kg7 30. Bf1 exd4 31. cxd4 Rxc1 32. Qxc1 Bb8 $1 {with
Qd6-h2 coming up in short order.}) 27... Bb8 28. exd5 Bxd5 29. Bf5 Rc6 30. Qa3

Caruana was in time trouble.} 31. Rad1 exd4 32. Bxd4 Ng5 33. c4 Rxe1+ 34. Rxe1
