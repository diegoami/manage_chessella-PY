1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bd3 {One of those innocuous openings that
Kramnik has prepared. Does he have some new ideas up his sleeve?} Nc6 5. c3 Nf6
(5... Qc7 {I prefer to put my queen here to stop Bf4, but Ivanchuk doesn't
think that is necessary.}) 6. Bf4 Bg4 7. Qb3 Qc8 8. Nd2 e6 9. Ngf3 Be7 10. O-O
Bh5 (10... O-O {may also transpose to the same thing.} 11. Ne5 $14 Nxe5 12.
Bxe5 Bh5 $11) 11. Rae1 (11. Ne5 Nxe5) 11... Bg6 12. Bxg6 hxg6 13. h4 $6 (13.
Ne5 {looks much more logical, although Black has equalized.}) 13... a6 14. c4
a5 $5 {Ivanchuk would like to play ...a4.} 15. a3 a4 16. Qd3 O-O 17. c5 b6 $1 {
I like this move immediately breaking White's structure.} 18. cxb6 Qb7 19. Bc7
(19. Qb5 Ra5 $15) 19... Nd7 20. Rc1 Rfc8 (20... Nxb6 21. Qb5 Qxc7 22. Rxc6 $18)
21. b4 axb3 22. Qxb3 Bxa3 {Black has won back his pawn and the one on b6 is
still weak, so Black is surely beginning to push.} 23. Rc3 Be7 24. Rfc1 Nb4 {
Threatening Na2.} 25. Ne5 Nxe5 26. Bxe5 Rxc3 27. Qxc3 Qxb6 {Black is a pawn up.
Recognizing, that the technical task against a player of Kramnik's calibre is not
easy, Ivanchuk is not worried. He just plays slowly and converts
the position.} 28. Nf3 Qd8 29. Qb3 Rc8 30. Ra1 Rc4 31. g3 Qc8 32. Kg2 Nc6 33.
Qb5 Bf8 34. Ra4 Rxa4 35. Qxa4 Nb4 36. Qb5 Qc2 37. Qf1 Qe4 {With purposeful
play Black has been able to push White back.} 38. Qe1 f6 39. Bc7 Nc2 40. Qxe4
dxe4 41. Nd2 {When this position was reached, I had my doubts whether Ivanchuk
would be able to convert it against Kramnik. But the Ukrainian genius had
absolutely no issues.} f5 42. Nb3 Ne1+ 43. Kf1 Nf3 44. Ke2 Kf7 45. Bb6 Bb4 46.
Ke3 Ke8 47. Bc5 Bc3 48. Ba3 Kf7 49. Bd6 Kf6 50. Bc7 Ke7 51. Bb8 Bb2 52. Bf4 Kd8
53. Bd6 Kd7 54. Bf8 Kc6 55. Bxg7 Kd5 {The g7 pawn was sacrificed to get the
king to this great square.} 56. Bf6 Bc3 57. Ke2 Kc4 58. Nc5 (58. Nc1 Nxd4+ 59.
Bxd4 Bxd4 $19) 58... e5 $1 {It's game over!} 59. Nd7 exd4 60. Bd8 d3+ 61. Kd1

68. Kd2 Nxf2 69. h5 gxh5 70. Ne3 h4 71. Nxf5 h3 {Kramnik didn't play so well,
but Ivanchuk was almost flawless.} 0-1
