It's nice to see that there are some who still seek asymmetry.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {Finally someone who is prepared to play a principled move.} ({Karjakin came up with} 6. a3 {in the first round against Giri. I guess this move is inspired by a kind of psychic prophylaxis: "I'll stop you from playing b5-b4 because the cards say that you will play b7-b5." Then Carlsen followed suit in round 2, and won. "Principled" is so yesterday.}) 6... e6 7. f4 h6 {This line has ascended from obscurity into the limelight in only a few years. Compared to the normal poisoned pawn lines (without h6 and Bh4) I can only find one small difference (but possibly I've missed something). } (7... Qb6 8. Qd2 (8. Qd3 $5) (8. a3 Nc6 {is much better for Black now that there is no Bf2.}) 8... Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. e5 (10. f5 {is one option that is unique to this move order.}) 10... h6 {leads to the same position described after 9.Qd2. I'm still not much wiser as to why Black prefers h6 to the direct Qb6.}) 8. Bh4 Qb6 {This move is played in many Sicilian scenarios, with the idea of luring White to place Nd4 on a more passive square. White is not in the habit of cooperating.} 9. a3 {This is the latest fashion.} (9. Qd2 Qxb2 10. Rb1 Qa3 11. e5 dxe5 12. fxe5 {is the main line, with thousands of games. In Parimarjan Negi's (exceptional) book "1.e4 vs The Sicilians 1", there is a chapter dealing with this line called simply "20...Rd8". You get the picture. Perhaps this line has fallen out of grace just because it is impossible to keep track of all the ins and outs.} {If you go down the rabbit hole, you will be likely to meet something like} Nfd7 13. Ne4 Qxa2 14. Rd1 Qd5 15. Qe3 Qxe5 16. Be2 Bc5 17. Bg3 Qd5 18. c4 Bxd4 19. Rxd4 Qa5+ 20. Rd2 O-O 21. Bd6 f5 22. Bxf8 Nxf8 23. Nd6 Nbd7 {where Black is currently doing all right. Wei Yi has tried this twice with White, with no success.}) ({After} 9. Qd3 Qxb2 10. Rb1 Qa3 {I get the feeling that h6/Bh4 favours Black somewhat.}) ({Without h6/Bh4, White could consider} 9. Nb3 {, although it would be a terribly passive move. Here it is just bad because of} Qe3+ {winning a pawn.}) 9... Nbd7 {This is a first step off the most trodden paths, and a step that I like.} ({The normal} 9... Be7 {almost forces White to play} 10. Bf2 {, when} Qc7 11. Qf3 Nbd7 12. O-O-O b5 13. g4 {featured in three absolute top games in 2016. The last game saw:} Bb7 14. Bg2 Rc8 15. Kb1 g5 16. Qh3 Nc5 17. Rhe1 h5 18. Nf5 $1 Ncxe4 19. Bxe4 Nxe4 20. Bd4 {with a huge attack for White, in Nakamura,H (2775)-Vachier Lagrave,M (2800) 8th London Classic 2016. It has been clear since then that Black needed to find an improvement.}) (9... Nc6 10. Bf2 {with splendid chances for White, is the main difference to the usual poisoned pawn lines (7.. .Qb6).}) (9... Qxb2 10. Na4 {and as we all know; the knight on the rim is dim.} ) 10. Be2 {This move doesn't quite fit with the usual narrative of "queen goes to f3, long castle, g4, bam!", but it isn't obviously wrong. I'm very curious as to how far Wei Yi's preparation stretched. When I read his comments, I get the feeling that he has an exceptional "sense" of what goes on in the Najdorf and that his preparations are more conceptual than they are detailed.} ({After } 10. Bf2 Qc7 11. Qf3 {, hoping for 11...Be7, Black can instead play} b5 { , which seems a bit more active.}) (10. Bc4 e5 $5) 10... e5 {As far as I can tell, this is a novelty.} ({However, now that the queen's route to f3 is obstructed, it is again possible to play} 10... Be7 11. Bf2 Qc7 {From Black's perspective this line seems preferable to the game.} {White should continue with} 12. Bf3 {and then either} g6 ({or} 12... Nb6 {, intending e6-e5, seems possible.})) 11. Nf5 $1 {White's minor pieces start swarming and the knight is on the road towards d5. Still, Black cannot tolerate the knight on f5 and has to kick it towards its goal.} g6 12. Bf2 $5 {This means either a) that Wei Yi has prepared the position deeply and seen that the 12.Ne3 is less clear than the engines indicate, or b) that he didn't prepare the position and played Bf2 on instinct. Considering how the game continues and the fact that he spent quite a lot of time on this move, it seems more likely that b) was the case.} ( {The engine likes} 12. Ne3 {better, intending} Qxe3 13. Bf2 {At first sight it seems that} Ng4 (13... Qxf4 14. g3 Qxe4 15. Nxe4 Nxe4 16. Bf3 Nxf2 17. Kxf2 h5 {is another possibility, but the bishop on f3 looks strong here.}) 14. Bxe3 Nxe3 15. Qd2 Nxg2+ 16. Kd1 Nxf4 {is fine for Black, but when you evaluate this kind of line you must first of all look for forced lines. Indeed, in this case there is such a one:} 17. Rf1 $1 {Intending Rxf4. If Black is allowed to solidify his position then the sacrifice will be less effective.} Be7 (17... g5 18. Nd5) 18. Rxf4 exf4 19. Nd5 Bd8 20. Qxf4 Ne5 21. c4 {and Black is definitely under pressure. I wonder if Wei Yi considered this line and chose not to enter it?}) 12... Nc5 {After this move we seem to be on a one way road, so if Black is to find an improvement (apart from 10...Be7), then this is the place to look for it.} (12... Qc7 $6 13. Ne3 exf4 14. Ned5 $36) (12... Qc6 $5 13. fxe5 dxe5 14. Ne3 Bc5 15. O-O) 13. b4 $1 {Being ahead in development, it's the initiative, not the pawns, that count.} gxf5 14. O-O $5 ({There was nothing wrong with} 14. bxc5 {and it is far from clear that Wei Yi's move is the better one. It keeps things simple and allows for Black to be a bit surprised.}) 14... Nfxe4 (14... Qc7 {leads to the same position as after 16... Qc7.}) 15. Nxe4 fxe4 16. bxc5 dxc5 (16... Qc7 $1 17. Qd5 (17. Rb1 $5 Be6 18. Bg4) 17... Qc6 18. Bc4 Be6 19. Qxc6+ bxc6 20. Bxe6 fxe6 21. cxd6 exf4 22. Bd4 Rg8 23. Rxf4 Bxd6 24. Rxe4 {leads to a slightly better endgame for White, but there are other promising alternatives on move 17.}) 17. fxe5 $6 ({Here} 17. Qd5 {was the strongest move. After something like} Bg7 18. Rad1 Be6 19. Qxe4 exf4 20. Qa4+ Qc6 21. Qxc6+ bxc6 22. Bxc5 {White has good winning chances.}) ( 17. Bh4 Rg8 {is less clear.}) 17... Be6 18. Rb1 Qc6 19. Bg4 {The bishop on e6 is the linchpin of Black's position, so White must challenge it.} b5 ({Black can also consider} 19... Rd8 20. Qe2 Be7 21. Bxe6 fxe6 22. a4 h5 $132) 20. Bh4 $1 {The most active place for the bishop that also opens the route for the rook to f6.} Rg8 $6 ({Black should keep the rook out of f6:} 20... Bg7 $1 21. Bf6 Bxf6 22. Rxf6 Rd8 {is unclear. The queenside structure gives Black some reasons to be optimistic.}) 21. Bxe6 Qxe6 22. Rf6 $1 Qg4 $1 (22... Qxe5 23. Rxa6 $1 Rc8 24. Rc6 $1 Ra8 25. Qe2 c4 26. a4 Rg6 27. Bf6 Rxf6 28. Rxf6 Rxa4 ( 28... Qxf6 29. Qxe4+) 29. Rbf1 {is close to winning for White.}) 23. Qd2 Be7 24. Rf4 Qd7 ({Black seeks salvation in exchanges, falls into a trap. Better was } 24... Qe6 25. Bxe7 Qxe7 26. Rxe4 Rg6 {, when White is better, but no more.}) 25. Qxd7+ Kxd7 26. e6+ $1 {There's the trap.} ({After} 26. Rxf7 Rae8 {Black is doing very well. For instance:} 27. c4 e3 28. cxb5 axb5 29. Rxe7+ (29. Rxb5 $2 Kc6 $19) 29... Rxe7 30. Bxe7 Kxe7 31. Rxb5 e2 32. Kf2 (32. Rb1 Ke6) 32... Rxg2+ 33. Ke1 Rxh2 {with equality. With a c-pawn and such a centralized king, Black is happy to enter almost any rook endgame.}) 26... fxe6 (26... Kxe6 $2 27. Rxe4+) 27. Rf7 Rg5 ({A neccessity since} 27... Rae8 28. Rd1+ {loses a piece.}) 28. Rd1+ Ke8 29. Rh7 b4 ({Black gets some more chances with} 29... c4 {aiming to pick up the a-pawn for nothing. Still, after} 30. Bxg5 hxg5 31. Kf2 Bxa3 32. Ke3 a5 33. Kxe4 a4 34. c3 {Black is struggling to survive but White's advantage is not a comfortable one. Black's pawns look menacing and a small mistake might cost the game.}) 30. a4 c4 31. Bxg5 hxg5 32. Rh8+ Bf8 33. Rf1 Ke7 34. Rh7+ Kd6 35. Rh8 Ke7 36. Rh7+ {White's next few moves are anything but random. The point is that he gets a rook to the c-file, which makes it easier to handle Black queenside pawns.} Kd6 37. Rhf7 Bh6 38. Rd1+ Ke5 39. Rc7 c3 { Black hopes to be able to make b4-b3 work at some point. The downside is that Black's queenside pawns are robbed of most of their dynamism.} ({Perhaps Nepomniachtchi didn't have enough time to calculate the consequences of} 39... b3 $5 40.

Rd4 {was better, although I can symphatize with Wei Yi's handling of the situation. He doesn't risk anything by taking it easy.}) 43... Rd8 44. Rf1+ Ke7 45. Rc7+ Kd6 46. Rc4 Ke7 $6 (46... Ke5 $1 47.

All of Black's active pawns gets liquidated within the next few moves. In the resulting endgame, the e-pawn is of little consequence, whereas the a4-pawn becomes a hero.} Rd2+ 53. Kxc3 Kf5 54. Re1 Rxg2 55. Rc5+ Kf6 56. Re4 Rxh2 57. Rxg4 a5 {Black is able to save the a-pawn by tactical means, but now he is left with two weaknesses: the a-pawn and the e-pawn.} 58. Kd3 Rd2+ (58... Rh3+ 59.
