In this game, he faced another original and attacking player, Super-GM Richard Rapport, whose uncompromising approach has brought him brilliant results. All these are indicative of a tense and exciting battle.} d5 {(0s)} 2. c4 {(0s)} c6 {(7s)} 3. cxd5 $5 {(455s) An interesting choice after some thought! What is Mamedyarov up to?!} cxd5 {(13s)} 4.

In most of the games in this line, White has just a small edge but Black does not have so much counterplay.} Na5 {(12s)} 8. Qa4+ {(3s)} Bd7 { (5s)} 9. Qd1 {(2s)} Rc8 {(647s)} 10.

White has the threat of Bg5. That simple isn't it? Nevertheless, now Black cannot castle due to Bxh6 tricks.} 17. Rfc1 {(1500s)} Bxc3 {(169s)} 18. bxc3 {(2s)} Rxc3 {(64s)} 19. g4 {(10s) Logical!
