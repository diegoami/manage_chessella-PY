Rfe1 Rb8 18. Rad1 Bxe5 19. Qxe5 Qxe5 20. Rxe5 {Diagram [#] A very important
position to not only understand the situation arising on the board but also to
improve your chess understanding. It is White's dynamic edge of lead in
development against Black's static advantage of better pawn structure. White
has to play actively and be alert not to let Black finish his development. If
he is able to do that, Navara will have Caruana under pressure, but if Caruana
develops his bishop and connects his rooks, there are high chances that Black
will be better. After the game Navara mentioned that he had played a few
practice games on this position. Quite an invaluable experience while playing
this game.} b6 {Naturally trying to develop the bishop on b7.} 21. c5 $1 {

avoid. He is passive and will face not an easy defensive task.}) 22. cxb6 (22.

of Bg4 allows this move.} (24... Re8 25. Rb2 $14) 25. fxe5 $2 {Navara takes
the risk.} (25. Bd5+ Kg6 26. Re3 {With somewhere around equal position.}) 25...

saw here are unclear. Black is just better and has a tangible advantage. For
eg.} 28. Rdd2 Bxe2 29. Rxe2 Rfe8 30. Bc6 Re7 $17 {Only Black can be better.})

better, and though the text move is far from losing, it is the accumulation of

a slight positional edge because his bishops is centrally located and the b6

king, an active bishop and also the rook. It is amazing how David could create
such play from quite a docile position.} Rg6 41. Ke5 Rg5 42. Rb8 Rg6 43. Rh8

Black's defensive task is not so easy anyway.}) 50. a5 $1 {A strong move which

preparing Kd6. Black is helpless.} f4 53. Kd6 Bc8 54. c6 Rg5 55. Bf7 {c7 is a
bitter pill to swallow! Â What a beautiful technical win by Navara! Simply
outstanding. Some people might say that Fabiano was not upto the mark in this
game, but to even put a 2787 opponent under pressure from the opening position
that arose requires great feel of the dynamics. Something which we know that
Navara amply possesses after seeing his king walk to h8 against Wojtaszek!} 1-0
