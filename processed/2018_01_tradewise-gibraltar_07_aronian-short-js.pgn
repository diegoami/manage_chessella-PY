1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 d6 3. Nf3 f5 4. g3 Nc6 ({Black nearly always prefers} 4... Nf6
{here.}) 5. d4 e4 6. d5 Ne5 (6... exf3 7. dxc6 bxc6 8. exf3 Nf6 9. Bg2 {
leads to a stable advantage for White, with pressure along the long diagonal
and e-file.}) 7. Nxe5 $5 ({Other games have featured} 7. Nd4 {but there is one
previous Aronian game with the text move on the database, with which Black had
no doubt familiarised himself.}) 7... dxe5 8. g4 {Making a messy pawn
structure even messier.} Bc5 (8... g6 9. gxf5 gxf5 10. Rg1 Nf6 11. Bg5 Be7 12.
e3 Rg8 13. Rg3 Rg6 14. Be2 {was the continuation in a blitz game between
Aronian and Ivanchuk in Leuven last July, which White won in 27 moves.}) 9. Qb3
$1 {This is also an engine first choice. For us lesser mortals it is very hard
to understand why White should have played this (given that, at this level,
the cheapo threat of Qb5+ and Qxc5 would be unlikely to work). But subsequent
play give us a few clues.} Nf6 (9... a6 {is possible here. Perhaps then} 10.
Na4 {and White has the possibility of transferring the queen to g3 where it
could support a pawn advance.}) 10. Qb5+ Nd7 11. h4 {Evidently White wanted to
get the h4 advance in without the nuisance of a black knight on f6 being able
to capture the g-pawn.} a6 12. Qb3 e3 ({Black opts to cut the white position
in half with this pawn sacrifice, which is a common theme in a number of
position. Instead Black would perhaps have liked to play} 12... g6 {but then}
13. h5 {would be a little awkward. That seems to be the gist of White's Qb3/h4
idea.}) 13. Bxe3 Bxe3 14. fxe3 fxg4 15. Ne4 Nf6 16. Bg2 O-O 17. c5 Kh8 18.
O-O-O {[#]} Bf5 $5 ({Both players have completed their development, more or
less, and the position seems about equal. Black immediately embarks on a very
ambitious plan.} 18... Rb8 {looks a safer option.}) 19. Ng3 Bg6 20. h5 Nxh5 ({
A bold piece sacrifice.} 20... Bf7 21. h6 g6 (21... gxh6 {is probably better})
22. Qxb7 Rb8 23. Qc6 {and White is a safe pawn up.}) 21. Nxh5 Rf2 22. Bf1 Qf8 {
Black threatens to win the piece back with Bxh5 followed by Rxf1 so White has
to surrender the c-pawn.} 23. Ng3 Qxc5+ 24. Qc3 Qe7 {Black has two pawns for
the piece plus he has forced several of White's pieces into passive defence.
White has to wriggle his way out of trouble.} 25. e4 Qg5+ 26. Kb1 Qf4 27. Ka1
Rf8 28. Rg1 Rf7 (28... Bxe4 {is tempting but it eases White's way back into
the game:} 29. e3 Qf3 30. Bd3 {and now} Bxd5 31. Nh1 $1 Rh2 32. Qxe5 {when
White is now firing on all cylinders.}) 29. e3 Qg5 30. Bc4 Rd7 31. Qb4 b5 32.
Nf5 {Threatening mate in one.} h5 33. Qe1 Rf3 (33... Rh2 34. Qg3 Bxf5 35. Qxh2
Bxe4 36. Bb3 {is a computer suggestion but it looks too optimistic for Black.})
34. Be2 Rh3 35. Bf1 Bxf5 (35... Rh2 36. Qg3 Rc2 37. Bd3 Rc5 {chases the c5
rook to a square where it has no bearing on the game, allowing White to win as
he pleases.}) 36. Bxh3 Bxe4 37. Bg2 Bxg2 38. Rxg2 h4 ({A final error, losing a
kingside pawn but} 38... Kh7 {would only prolong the agony.}) 39. Qb4 (39. Qb4
g3 40. Rh1 Rxd5 41. Qxh4+ Qxh4 42. Rxh4+ Kg8 43. Rh1 {is an easy win.}) 1-0
