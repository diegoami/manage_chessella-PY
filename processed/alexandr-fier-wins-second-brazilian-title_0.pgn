as it might seem, this endgame is a tablebase draw. One of the key aspects is
the matter of the bishop and h-pawn. If the b-pawn is removed, White cannot win
even if black lost all his material since the bishop is the wrong color and
does not control the h8-square.} Nb4 68. Bf3 Nc2 $2 {This is a tremendous

considerable analysis.}) 77... Ne6+ 78. Kc4 Kd6 79. Bf7 Nf4 80. b5 Ne2 81. Bd5

on him the win had slipped away, and the next 20 odd moves were a reflection of
this rather than renewed attempts at a swindle. Mekhitarian was clearly upset
at the board, and playing more to calm his nerves than anything. Fier was
playing all his moves almost instantly.} 85. Kc5 Ne6+ 86. Kd5 Ng7 $1 87. Kc4
