1. g3 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bg2 c5 4. O-O Nc6 5. d3 {It is almost impossible to
take Karen out of his favourite schemes, irrespective of the colour. He would
almost always develop in the spirit of the King's Indian or Modern Defences.}
e5 6. Na3 Bd6 7. c4 {[#]But this time he tries something new. After the game
he confessed he was no Benoni expert and asked me whether he reacted well to
Black's central attack in the middlegame.} d4 8. e3 O-O 9. exd4 cxd4 10. Bg5 h6
11. Bxf6 Qxf6 {White's extra tempo with respect to a genuine (not reversed)
Benoni is not one-sided. With his knight on b1 (b8 actually) still, he would
play Nbd2, followed by a2-a3, Qc2, c4-c5, Nc4 and so on. The way it is,
White's control in the centre is not too reliable.} 12. Nd2 Qe7 13. Nc2 f5 14.
Re1 Qf6 15. a3 {[#]} e4 $5 ({Typical for the Penrose attack. But in view of
White's 19th move, it would have been wiser to prepare the attack with} 15...
a5) 16. dxe4 f4 17. e5 $1 {This was one of the moves Karen was not sure about,
but I confirmed that it is a good idea to avoid a blockade on e5 and clear the
e4-square for the own minor pieces.} Bxe5 18. Ne4 Qf5 19. Nb4 {Somehow,
White's knights became very active.} f3 20. Bf1 Qh5 21. c5 Bh3 22. Qd3 Bxf1 23.
Qxf1 Rad8 24. Rad1 Ne7 25. Nd3 $14 {[#]White has parried all threats and his
blockade on light squares offer him the better prospects. Black's bishop will
soon turn into his worst piece while the daring f-pawn is vulnerable.} Ng6 26.
Nd2 Bb8 27. Re4 Rd7 28. Rde1 Kh7 29. b4 $16 Rdf7 $6 {The d4-pawn was in danger
due to Nb3, but giving it away so easily does not improve Black's position.}
30. Rxd4 Rf5 31. Re3 Qg5 32. Qd1 Qf6 33. Ree4 {White's piece flow over the
last 10 moves is impressive.} Rf7 34. Ne1 {The f3-pawn is doomed and the game
is basically over.} Be5 35. Rd3 Bc3 36. Rd6 Qg5 37. Ndxf3 Rxf3 38. Nxf3 Qf5 39.
Re3 Ne5 40. Kg2 1-0
