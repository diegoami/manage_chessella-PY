Strong GMs like Sethuraman and Motylev unable to execute the mate with very little time on the clock. It was nice to see Petrosian having absolutely no problems in mating his opponent. Let's learn from the Armenian.} 95. Kc4 Ke3 96. Kd5 Bg3 97. Kc4 Nf4 98. Kc5 Ke4 99. Kc6 Bf2 {It always makes sense to place your knight and bishop on the same coloured squares so that they can control different colours.} 100. Kd6 Kd4 101. Kc6 Nd5 102. Kd6 Bg3+ 103. Kc6 Nb4+ 104. Kb5 Bd6 105. Kb6 Kc4 106. Kb7 { Korobov does the right thing trying to go towards the wrong coloured corner square.} Kc5 107. Ka8 (107. Kc8 Kc6 108. Kd8 Nd5 $1 {The knight is on the right circuit. The way I remember this circuit is - the a8 square can only be controlled by a knight and the best square for it to do that is c7. From c7, as we have read in numerous books the right movement is to move in W shape i.e c7-d5-e7-f5.} 109. Ke8 Ne7 110. Kf7 Kd7 111. Kf6 Bf4 {And this is a typical way to lock the opponent's king.}) 107... Kc6 (107... Kb6 {would be painful!}) 108. Ka7 Nd5 109. Ka8 Nb6+ {Now Petrosian will push his king to the a1 square. From this point onwards you should remember the mating pattern.} 110. Ka7 Bc7 { A waiting move to push the king to a6 and then control the a7 square with Bb8.} 111. Ka6 Bb8 112. Ka5 Nd5 {The knight moves in the W circuit. Now the b4 square is controlled. This is essentially the forking of roads. Beginners are most afraid of Ka4 as then it seems the king runs away. In the game Korobov went for the other option with Ka6.} 113. Ka6 (113. Ka4 {It seems the king is running away to freedom but looks how the knight and bishop will co-ordinate to lock the white king.} Kc5 114. Kb3 Nb4 {Taking control of the important c2 square and staying on the W circuit.} 115. Kc3 {c2 and d3 are controlled. We only need to protect d2.} Bf4 $1 {This is the formation that you must engrave in your head. The knight and bishop control all the squares and White king has to retreat.} 116. Kb2 Bd2 {The cage is made smaller.} 117. Kb3 Kb5 118. Ka3 Kc4 119. Ka4 Nd3 120. Ka3 Bb4+ 121. Ka2 (121. Ka4 Nb2#) 121... Kc3 122. Kb1 Kb3 123. Ka1 Kc2 124. Ka2 Nc1+ 125. Ka1 Bc3#) 113... Nb4+ 114.
