{Wonderful things
happen in this game. Let's have a look as to why Fedoseev is considered
as one of the best upcoming players in the world.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6
3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e5 7. Nb3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. Be3
Nbd7 (9... Be6 {is the main move here.}) 10. a4 b6 11. Bc4 $5 {White takes
control of the d5 square and aims for a long manuevre with his b3 knight
as we shall see in the game.} Bb7 12. Nd2 Qc7 13. Qe2 Nc5 14. Rfd1 $1
{The e4 pawn cannot really be touched right now.} Rfd8 (14... Ncxe4 $6
15. Ndxe4 Nxe4 (15... Bxe4 16. Nxe4 Nxe4 17. Bd5 $16) 16. Nd5 $1 $16)
15. Bxc5 $1 {The first unusual move of the game. In the Sicilian we are
taught that the dark squared bishop is extremely important and we shouldn't
part with it so easily. But here the battle is for the d5 square and the
bishop on e3 doesn't really fight for it. Hence, this is a very logical
move.} Qxc5 16. Nf1 $1 {The knight gets ready to go to e3 to control the
d5 square.} b5 17. Bb3 bxa4 $6 (17... b4 {looked more natural, although
after} 18. Nd5 Nxd5 19. Bxd5 Bxd5 20. Rxd5 $16 {White is clearly better.})
18. Rxa4 Bc6 19. Rc4 Qb6 20. Ne3 a5 {White is better, there is no doubt
about that. But how to increase your advantage?} 21. g4 $1 { An unusual
move but once again extremely logical. The knight on f6 will be kicked
away and the white knights will enjoy itself on the d5 square.} Qb7 22.
g5 Nd7 23. Rxc6 $1 {A tactical sequence but it is not so easy to spot
what is going on. The real weakness that Fedoseev has spotted like an
eagle is the f7 square.} Qxc6 24. Nf5 Bf8 (24... Re8 25. Qh5 g6 26. Bxf7+
Kxf7 27. Qxh7+ Ke6 28. Ng7+ Kf7 29. Nh5+ Ke6 30. Qxg6+ $18) 25. Qf3 $1
{Surprisingly it is extremely difficult to meet Nh6+.} Kh8 26. Nh4 Nc5
27. Bxf7 Qd7 28. Ng6+ $1 { Not so difficult for a player like Fedoseev
but nonetheless very beautiful.} hxg6 29. Bxg6 {There is just no way to
prevent the mate on h5. You have to agree that it was simply a terrific
game by the Russian youngster.} 1-0
