Two of the top guns in the Olympiad since the fall of the Soviet Union and the two countries in political conflict! That would be enough tension to win most of the attention of the fourth round at the Baku Chess Olympiad. In a 'black' day in this match, ex-FIDE world champion, Ruslan Ponomariov, delivered one of the two victories for the Ukrainian team to let his teammates edge Russia 2.5-1.5} 1. d4 {(0s)} Nf6 {(0s)} 2. c4 {(0s)} e6 {(0s)} 3. Nf3 {(0s)} b6 {(9s)} 4. g3 {(54s)} Bb7 {(17s) Ponomariov adopts this classical system in the QID over 4...Ba6} 5. Bg2 {(42s)} Be7 {(12s)} 6. O-O {(75s)} O-O {(17s)} 7. Nc3 {(76s)} (7. Re1 {is another common move in this opening.}) 7... Ne4 {(44s)} 8. Bd2 {(9s)} Bf6 {(80s)} (8... f5 { is considered the main line. Ponomariov goes for a less theoretical, yet more passive continuation.}) 9. Rc1 {(606s) Surprised by Pono's choice, Tomashevsky goes for the mainline after thinking for a while.} Nxd2 {(202s)} 10. Qxd2 {(35s)} d6 {(29s)} 11. d5 {(871s)} e5 {(78s)} 12. e4 {(112s) Here comes the typical position arising after Bf6. White has given up on his pair of bishops but he manages to have more space and Black's bishop pair is not doing much in this position. To sum it up in one sentence: Black does not have any weaknesses but he is passive and has less space.} Nd7 {(220s)} 13. h4 {(153s)} (13. b4 a5 14. a3 g6 15. h4 Bg7 16. Bh3 Nf6 {could have been an alternative continuation here. There are not so many games in this line in the database.}) 13... a5 {(282s) This stops White's play on the queenside but now White has enough time to shut down any Black activity on the kingside and plan a long-term campaign thanks to his space advantage.} 14. Bh3 {(98s)} Nc5 {(437s)} 15. Kg2 {(135s)} Bc8 {(282s)} 16. Bxc8 {(1037s)} Qxc8 {(71s)} 17. Qe2 {(124s) A quick evaluation: White has a small edge thanks to Black's passive bishop on f6. The case of White losing this game is almost unthinkable.} Be7 {(571s)} 18. Nd2 {(275s)} Nd7 {(1020s)} (18... f5 19. exf5 Qxf5 20. Nde4 {would only give away the beautiful e4 square to White's knights.}) (18... g6 19. h5 { and White is faster to mobalize his pieces on the h-file.}) 19. Rh1 {(599s) White prepares an assault on the kingside. Black's position is very unpleasant. He does not have any counterplay and White is gradually grinding his advantage with no risk.} Nf6 {(100s)} 20. Nf1 {(196s) This knight is going to land on e3. This is too typical to earn an exclamation mark!} h5 {(703s)} 21. Ne3 {(165s)} g6 {(8s)} 22. Rcg1 $1 {(319s) Now we know what Tomashevsky's long-term plan is. He is preparing a king-march to the queenside in order to keep his king safe before the final attack. This concept was first introduced by the 9th world chess champion Tigran Petrosian.} Kg7 {(169s)} 23. Kf1 {(166s)} Rh8 $1 { (33s) Ponomariov is ready to face g4.} 24. Ke1 {(108s)} Qd7 {(213s)} 25. Kd1 { (50s)} Kg8 {(240s)} 26. f3 {(144s)} Bf8 $1 {(103s) QID position has transformed into a KID position. Now Black's King's Indian bishop finds a nice spot: the bishop goes to g7 or h6 to cover his mighty king.} 27. g4 { (47s) Tomashevsky starts his attack.} Rh7 {(64s)} 28. Kc2 {(100s)} Be7 {(140s) } 29. Rg2 {(62 s)} (29. g5 Ne8 30. Kb1 Bf8 31. Rf1 Bg7 32. Nb5 Rh8 33. f4 { I wonder how Black is going to defend f7.} exf4 34. Rxf4 Be5 35. Rf3 Kg7 36. Rhf1 Rf8 37. Qf2 Kg8 38. Nc2 Ng7 39. Ncd4 Rae8 40. Nc6 Qg4 41. Qc2 $1 {Black seems to be completely out of any useful move.} Qd7 (41... Qxh4 42. Nxc7) 42. Qd3 Qc8 43. Nxe5 Rxe5 44. Nd4 a4 45. Nc6 Ree8 46.

Rh3 $4 {(46s) I do not understand... Doesn't this just lose a pawn?!} hxg4 {(142s)} 34. fxg4 {(65s)} Rxh4 {(6s) Ponomariov grabs the pawn!} 35. Rxh4 {(98s)} Bxh4 {(4s)} 36. Qh2 {(37s)} Bg5 $1 {(24s) Ponomariov keeps his head cool, the bishop goes to f4 and covers everything including the f-file. Black is much better now.} 37. Qh7+ {(113s)} Kf8 {(50s)} 38. Nh2 {(34s)} Qf6 {(457s)} 39. Rf1 {(50s)} Bf4 {(171s)} 40. Nf3 { (0s)} Ke7 {(0s) Tomashevsky has managed to transform his position from much better to slightly better and five moves later he is totally lost!} 41. Rh1 {(617s)} Bg3 { (222s)} 42. Nd2 {(547s)} Qf4 {(296s)} 43. Qh3 {(484s)} Nf6 {(193s) Mercilessly, Pono grabs the second pawn. The game is practically over.} 44. Qg2 {(166s)} Qxg4 {(157s)} 45. Ne2 {(127s)} Bf4 {(66s)} 46. Nxf4 {(11s)} exf4 { (49s)} 47. Qf1 {(44s)} Nh5 {(61s)} 48. Qd3 {(32s)} Kf8 {(179s)} 49. a3 {(59s)} Re8 {(91s)} 50. Ka2 {(4s)} Kg7 {(34s)} 51. Nf3 {(18s)} Nf6 {(48s)} 52. Re1 { (43s)} Nd7 {(70s) The final phase: Black trades the knights and he will gradually push his extra pawns.} 53. Qc3+ {(71s)} Ne5 {(66s)} 54. Rf1 {(5s)} Qh3 {(157s)} 55. Qc1 {(14s)} Nxf3 {(102s)} 56. Qc3+ {(2s)} f6 {(51s)} 57. Rxf3 {(5s)} Qg4 {(4s)} 58. Qd3 {(111s)} Rh8 {(15s) Tomashevsky had enough. Ponomariov was well rewarded for his passive 'waiting' strategy. What can I say about Tomashevsky's blunder? Well, when the tension is high we can all make mistakes. After all, we are human!} 0-1
