Qe2 Re8 9. Bd2 Bd6 10. h4 $5 $146 {Anand, Mcshane and Libiszewski have played
g4 prior to this. Wei Yi has the similar intention of crashing through on the
kingside but starts with his h-pawn.} c5 11. h5 h6 {A very natural reaction
stopping the pawn from reaching h6.} 12. O-O-O Nb8 $5 {David sees that the d4
square can be a juicy one for his knight and tries to reroute it to that
square via c6. But one gets the feeling that it is a little bit too slow.} (
12... Nf6 {with the idea of Ng4 might be to the point.}) 13. Rdg1 Nc6 14. g4 $1
{The attack is just too strong.} f6 {Maybe Navara had banked on this move to
stop the opening of the floodgates, but it doesn't really help.} 15. g5 $3 fxg5
16. Nxg5 $1 Nd4 17. Qd1 hxg5 18. Bxg5 Be7 19. Be3 {With the g-file open and
the h-pawn coming down, this is already a decisive advantage to White.} Bf6 20.
h6 Re7 21. hxg7 Rxg7 22. Qh5 {One after another, the White pieces join in the
party.} Be6 23. Bh6 (23. Qh8+ Kf7 24. Rxg7+ Bxg7 25. Nxe5+ $1 Bxe5 26. Rh7+ Kg6
27. Rh6+ Kf7 28. Qxe5 $18 {Was a nice way to finish off the game.}) 23... Bf7
24. Bxg7 Bxh5 25. Bxf6+ Kf8 26. Bxd8 Ne2+ 27. Kb1 Nxg1 28. Bxc7 {What a
crushing victory for Wei Yi. All it took was for Navara to make a small
inaccuracy with Nb8 and the Chinese prodigy just launched an irresistable
attack.} 1-0
