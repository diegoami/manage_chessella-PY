decades of his illustrous career Alexei has more than held his own in the sharp
Meran variation, while facing the best of the best. It's getting tougher
though, as the new generation of players brings new ideas into the mix, with
their silicon companions by their side.} 13. Ne2 $5 {A fresh idea, introduced
