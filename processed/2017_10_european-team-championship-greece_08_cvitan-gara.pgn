77... Kf3 {[%emt 0:00:10] When a player is looking at such a position, she
must ask herself about the task management of the pieces. If White understood
that her king would never be able to help the rook stop the h-pawn, then it
would only leave one more alternative, namely to let the rook deal with the
h-pawn by itself and then use the king to support its pawn on the f-file.} 78.
