{Welcome everyone! This is GM Aleksandr Lenderman and I'll be presenting to you
round 8 game of the day at Geneva Grand Prix. Today there were many very
interesting games, but in the end I chose the draw between Grischuk and
Mamedyarov on one of the top boards, since not only it was very critical for
the standings, but also it was truly a great battle between two fighting
players.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3
d6 {Mamedyarov decides not to threaten playing the Marshall with 0-0 and
commits to a slower Ruy Lopez.} (7... O-O 8. c3 (8. a4 {White can also play the
popular slower line a4.}) 8... d5 {Would be the Marshall Gambit, the top guest
at the top level, especially by Levon Aronian, Magnus Carlsen, and Peter
Svidler.}) 8. c3 (8. a4 Bd7 {Sometimes on a4, Black has the option of Bd7 right
away.} (8... Bg4 {Or this.})) 8... O-O 9. h3 Nb8 {The other popular line, the
Breyer, which is very solid for Black and avoids very concrete lines.} 10. d4
Nbd7 11. Nbd2 Bb7 12. Bc2 Re8 13. Nf1 Bf8 14. Ng3 g6 15. a4 (15. b3 $5 { This
is also an alternative in this still, very theoretical position, and
interestingly enough, this move was featured by the exact same players back in
2006.} d5 (15... Bg7 {Of course Black doesn't have to play the concrete d5
move, and can play a solid move Bg7.}) 16. Bg5 $1 h6 17. Bh4 $1 g5 18. Nxg5
hxg5 19. Bxg5 exd4 $1 20. e5 $1 Rxe5 21. Rxe5 Nxe5 22. cxd4 Nc6 $1 23. Qd3 $1 {
1/2 (34) Grischuk,A (2710)-Mamedyarov,S (2728) Moscow 2006 CBM 116 [Lukacs/
Hazai] Here White has a very strong attack, but in the end this battle in 2006
ended also as a draw.} (23. Nh5 $1 {is still the main line, but the
consequences are unclear.})) 15... c6 (15... c5 $5 {was played by Kamsky
against Grischuk} 16. d5 c4 17. Bg5 h6 18. Be3 Nc5 19. Qd2 h5 {0-1 (101)
Grischuk,A (2748)-Kamsky,G (2720) Nalchik 2009 CBM 130 [Marin,M] And after a
complex battle White ended up actually losing, but his opening seems decent
enough here.}) 16. Bg5 h6 17. Be3 Qc7 18. Bd3 {Grischuk is the first one to
deviate, both from his own game against Mamedyarov, and in general Mamedyarov's
previous opponents.} (18. Qd2 {is an interesting alternative, played by Navara,
also against Mamedyarov.} Kh7 19. Bb3 exd4 (19... Re7 $5) 20. cxd4 Nxe4 21.
Nxe4 Rxe4 22. Bxh6 $2 {This was a basque game, so that explains this blunder.}
(22. Bxf7 $16) 22... Bxh6 23. Ng5+ Bxg5 24. Qxg5 Qd8 $19 { Though after futher
adventures White actually won this game.} 25. Qg3 Rxe1+ 26. Rxe1 d5 27. Qd6 Nf8
28. Qe7 Qd7 29. Qh4+ Kg7 30. Re7 Qd8 31. Qg5 Bc8 32. Rxf7+ {1-0 (32) Navara,D
(2734)-Mamedyarov,S (2747) Huai'an CHN 2016}) 18... Bg7 19. Qc1 Kh7 20. b4 $146
{The logical and consistent approach and according to my database this is a
novelty. The other game I saw White didn't play very logically and let Black
get control of the center and quickly control of the game.} (20. b3 Rac8 21.
Ra2 Re7 22. Nh2 $6 d5 $15 {0-1 (42) Muller,A (2095) -Donaldson Akhmilovskaya,E
(2410) Elista 1998 Black got control and won the game later.}) 20... Rac8
(20... Rad8 {Might be an alternative but in general I think these kinds of
positions are easier to play for White than Black.}) 21. Qd2 exd4 $5 {Black
decides to change the course of action and tries to create counterplay.} 22.
cxd4 Nb6 23. axb5 {Not the engine's top choice, but a logical idea trying to
either get d5 and the d4 square for one of his pieces, or opening the a-file.}
(23. Bf4 $1 {Komodo prefers this.} Nxa4 $2 (23... bxa4 24. e5 {Leads to similar
problems as after Nxa4.}) (23... Qd7 {To try to defend against e5.} 24. a5 Nc4
25. Qa2 Re6 26. Rad1 $16 {Seems very difficult for Black, but maybe it's not so
trivial to break through right away.}) 24. e5 {Is just bad for Black.} dxe5
(24... Nd5 25. exd6 Qd7 26. Nh5 $18 {Here also White has a decisive attack.
Black's pieces are misplaced and not defending the king.}) 25. Nxe5 $18 {White
is crashing through here.}) 23... cxb5 (23... axb5 24. Bf4 $16 {Seems inferior
for Black.}) 24. d5 Nfd7 (24... Nc4 $5 25. Bxc4 bxc4 $1 {Might've been a better
way for Black to create counterplay.} 26. Bd4 c3 27. Qc2 (27. Qf4 Qe7) 27...
Qc4) 25. Bd4 Ne5 (25... Qd8 {Would be also a solid alternative where White is
better thanks to the space and more active pieces but Black still has some
counterplay on the c-file.}) 26. Nxe5 dxe5 27. Rac1 Qd6 28. Bc5 Qf6 29. Nf1 Nd7
30. Rc2 Rc7 31. Qe3 Rec8 32. Nd2 Qf4 33. d6 $6 {Up to here Grischuk played
Brilliantly, but here maybe he got a bit materialistic and carried away with
the tempting option. However, this move looks like it spoils his advantage.}

{Was maybe what Grischuk expected in likely mutual time pressure.}) 34. dxc7
Qxe3 35. Rxe3 Ne6 $1 { The only move but sufficient. Maybe this was the move
Grischuk missed from afar.} 36. Nb3 (36. Nf3 {Might've been a better
unconventional try, to at least not let Black play Bf8 very quickly.} f6 37.
Re1 Bf8 38. Rb1 {And at least White is in time to defend the key b4 pawn.})
36... Bf8 37. Be2 (37. Na5 $5 Ba8 38. Nc6 {Was also a very interesting
practical try, since here Black actually has to find a very difficult computer
move to hold the balance.} Kg7 $3 {The point of this move is to improve the
king position and wait to see what White does. If he takes the e5 pawn, then he
wants to be able to take the b4 pawn without the f7 pawn hanging. This would
hold the balance.} (38... f6 $2 {Is very natural but it actually loses for
Black.} 39. Nd8 $3 Nxd8 (39... Nxc7 40. Ne6 Bd6 41. Be2 $18 {Is also easily
winning for White.} Bb7 42. Nxc7 Rxc7 43. Rxc7+ Bxc7 44. Rd3 Bc6 45. Rc3 $18)

some pawns and Black's pieces are very passive.} Kg8 42. Bc2 $1 Bxb4 43. Rd3 $1

draw slightly more difficult.} (40... h5 $1 41. Rd7 hxg4 42. Rxf7+ Kh6 43. f3

There were some inaccuracies in time pressure but it's much easier for me
sitting next to my Stockfish figuring these details out than working these
details out at the board under heavy time pressure and in general with big
stakes on the line.} 1/2-1/2
