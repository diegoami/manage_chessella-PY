1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Qc7 {Another pull-no-punches
opening choice from Matlakov, who in his Black games against the other 2 world
champions in this event (yep, quite a tough draw!) chose innovative systems in
the Italian and Ruy Lopez involving knights moving to the edge. Maybe this is
something of a habit for him, as in this game the c6-knight soon makes its way
to a5...} 6. Be3 a6 (6... Nf6 7. f4 Bb4 $5 {is an interesting attempt to make
do without ...a6 for at least a few moves:} 8. Ndb5 Qa5 9. e5 Nd5 10. Bd2 Nxc3
11. Bxc3 O-O 12. Qd2 a6 (12... f6 $5 $132) 13. Bxb4 Qxb4 14. Qxb4 Nxb4 15. Nd4
$132 {1/2-1/2 (15) Motylev,A (2656)-Svidler,P (2751) Tallinn 2016}) 7. Qd2 Nf6
8. f4 (8. O-O-O Bb4 9. f3 {is the absolute main line:} Ne5 (9... Na5 {is also
a thing here, but White must be slightly better in the ending after a3}) 10.
Nb3 b5 (10... d6 11. Bd4 $16 {was the unfortunate opening outcome (for Black)
of one game from the 2016 British Championships}) 11. Qf2 $5 {Main is 11.Qe1
but this is an interesting new idea.} Be7 $6 12. g4 d6 13. Rg1 Rb8 14. g5 $14 {
Dominguez Perez,L-Vachier Lagrave,M Berlin 2015}) 8... Bb4 9. Bd3 Na5 (9... Ne7
$5 {tries to play ...d5 under favourable circumstances, but just ends up
looking slow after the same move} 10. a3 $14) 10. a3 Bxc3 11. Qxc3 Qxc3+ 12.
bxc3 d5 13. exd5 (13. e5 Ne4 14. Nb3 Nc4 $11 {led to an interesting game with
a sidelined White knight:} 15. Bxc4 dxc4 16. Na5 Bd7 17. Bd4 Rc8 18. Nxb7 Bc6
19. Na5 Bd5 $44 {Volokitin,A-Giri,A Germany 2014}) 13... exd5 14. Nb3 Nc4 15.
Bd4 Ne4 16. Nc5 Nxc5 17. Bxc5 Bd7 {The position is similar in essence to
Mamedyarov-Carlsen from yesterday- the only difference being that Carlsen held
nearly effortlessly there, but Matlakov is not able to do the same today.} 18.
O-O-O O-O-O 19. Bxc4 dxc4 20. Bb6 Rde8 21. Rd4 Re6 {Dropping a healthy pawn by
force.} (21... Bb5 $5 22. Rhd1 Kb8 {looks a bit passive, but avoids going in
for hard-to-calculate forced lines. Black's idea is ...Rc8-c6.}) 22. Rxc4+ Rc6
(22... Kb8 23. Rd1 $5 Bb5 24. Rb4 Rxb6 25. c4 $14 {is unlikely to be much more
pleasant, since Black now ends up with doubled pawns himself.}) 23. Rxc6+ Bxc6
24. Rd1 Bxg2 25. Rg1 Be4 26. Rxg7 Bg6 27. a4 (27. f5 {immediately was also
possible, and Black's drawing chances may not be as good as they immediately
seem.}) 27... Rf8 28. Kb2 Kd7 (28... h5 {could also have been played, since it
is not clear, especially given the further course of the game, whether having
the king out helps or hinders Black's drawing efforts.}) 29. f5 Bxf5 30. Bc5
Rc8 31. Rxf7+ Ke6 32. Re7+ Kf6 33. Bb4 $14 {Now White has a healthy nibble,and
he coaxes ...a5.} a5 (33... b5 34. axb5 axb5 35. Rb7 Re8 36. Rxb5 Re2 $14 {
was a marginally better version of the same thing}) 34. Ba3 Rc4 35. Rxb7 Rxa4
36. Ra7 Re4 37. Rxa5 Re2 38. Bd6 Bxc2 39. c4 $16 {Eventually Carlsen had to be
able to swap one of his doubled pawns for another pawn. The position is now
completely thankless- the best Black can hope for is not even a straight draw,
but to have to defend rook and bishop against rook!} Ke6 40. Ra6 Bf5+ 41. Kc3
Be4 42. Kd4 Kf5 43. Ra5+ Kg4 44. c5 Bf3 45. Ra7 h6 46. Rh7 Re4+ 47. Kd3 Re6 48.
Kc4 Bc6 49. Rc7 Bh1 50. Kb5 h5 (50... Re1 $16 {keeps the game going a bit
better}) 51. Rg7+ Kh4 $6 {Walking into all kinds of mating motifs.} (51... Kf5
52. Rg1 Bf3 53. Rf1 {might have been a line Black was afraid of, but he
survives by defending with the rook:} Re3 $16) 52. Rg1 Ba8 53. Kb6 Re2 54. Kc7
Bd5 55. Rg3 Bh1 (55... Rxh2 56. Rd3 {is a nice small tactic}) 56. Rc3 Kg4 57.
c6 {So White has managed everything he needs to and he will win the bishop
without the need for a h-pawn swap. In a game Sowray-Harvey, Bedford 2013, the
weaker side continued even after the win of a similar piece, but ultimately
even after some inspired resistance was unable to save half a point.} 1-0
