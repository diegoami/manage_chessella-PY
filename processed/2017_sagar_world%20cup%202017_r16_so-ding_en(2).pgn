1. e4 {[%emt 0:00:00]} e5 {[%emt 0:00:12] Black goes for the solid 1...e5 in
response to e4. In such important encounters, it makes sense not to go for
Najdorfs and Caro-Kanns!} 2. Nf3 {[%emt 0:00:00]} Nc6 {[%emt 0:00:04]} 3. Bc4 {
[%emt 0:00:00] Wesley plays the Giuoco Piano. After the game he said that he
thought MVL was also white and there would be two Giuoco Pianos on the board!}
Nf6 {[%emt 0:00:22] Ding is not afraid of the move Ng5!? Usually we see top
players reaching the main lines of Giuoco Piano through the 3...Bc5 move order.
} 4. d3 {[%emt 0:00:14]} Bc5 {[%emt 0:00:10]} 5. c3 {[%emt 0:00:56]} d6 {
[%emt 0:02:56]} 6. O-O {[%emt 0:00:35]} O-O {[%emt 0:00:06]} 7. Re1 {[%emt 0:
01:15]} a5 {[%emt 0:00:47] The first person to play this move was Boris
Spassky in 1989. Later Eljanov and l'Ami played it, in 2016. The idea is to
make luft for the dark-squared bishop, but at the same time prevent queenside
expanstion by white. This does weaken the b5 square though.} 8. Nbd2 {[%emt 0:
07:05] Wesley had a good seven minute think before making this move.} Be6 {
[%emt 0:03:36]} 9. Bb5 {[%emt 0:05:15] The square b5 was weakened, so White
makes use of it. We are already in virgin territory.} Qb8 $5 {[%emt 0:01:08]
What an interesting idea by Ding Liren, taking a leaf out of the book of Akiba
Rubinstein, who made a similar manoeuvre against Janowski in Karlsbad 1907.
The queen will come to a7 and put more pressure on the a7-f2 diagonal.} 10. Nf1
{[%emt 0:17:51]} Qa7 {[%emt 0:01:31]} 11. Be3 {[%emt 0:08:03] Exchanging the
bishops is the most logical thing to do here.} Bxe3 {[%emt 0:02:10]} 12. Nxe3 {
[%emt 0:01:06]} Ne7 {[%emt 0:00:12] Black is preparing c6 and if possible also
d5.} 13. a4 {[%emt 0:02:06]} Ng6 {[%emt 0:07:09]} (13... c6 14. Bc4 d5 15. exd5
cxd5 16. Bb5 {And there can be some pressure on the e5 pawn in the future.})
14. Bc4 {[%emt 0:04:06]} Bxc4 {[%emt 0:05:25]} 15. Nxc4 {[%emt 0:00:06] Such
positions are deceptive. One might feel that they are equal and perhaps they
are. But one lapse in concentration and things can start going wrong pretty
quickly. Mainly I would say White has the better chances here if he can
engineer the d4 break.} Qa6 {[%emt 0:00:49]} 16. g3 {[%emt 0:04:33] Stopping a
Nf4 jump.} Rfe8 {[%emt 0:01:49]} 17. Qb3 {[%emt 0:00:55]} Nf8 {[%emt 0:03:58]}
18. Qb5 {[%emt 0:05:50] The white queen is well placed. Taking it will move
the pawn to b5 and help White to create some play down the a-file. But can you
tolerate this queen on b5?} Qxb5 {[%emt 0:08:59] After the game Ding said that
he shouldn't have taken the queen and instead should have continued with Ne6
or b6.} 19. axb5 {[%emt 0:00:04]} b6 {[%emt 0:00:03]} 20. Ra3 {[%emt 0:01:55]}
Ne6 {[%emt 0:02:18]} 21. Ne3 {[%emt 0:00:44]} Nc5 {[%emt 0:05:32]} 22. c4 {
[%emt 0:00:11] This might seem like a move where White has agreed to a locked
position, but it turns out that Wesley has something to play for here. Mainly
to put his knight on c2 from e1 and then try for the b4 break.} a4 {[%emt 0:20:
47] Ding thought for nearly 20 minutes coming up with this move.} ({Let's give
the move to White to understand what he is trying for.} 22... h6 23. Rea1 {
Now threatening b4} Rac8 24. Ne1 $14 {The knight will go to c2 and prepare b4.
It won't be an earth shattering advantage, but White is better.}) 23. Rea1 {

25... Nc5 26. Rda1 $14 (26. Nc2 {was what Ding thought was pretty strong.} c6 {
This seems like an error, but if this is not played then White will just go
from c2 to b4 and control the c6 square.} 27. bxc6 Rxc6 28. b4 $16)) 26. Rxd2 {
[%emt 0:00:01]} Nd7 {[%emt 0:00:10]} 27. Rd1 {[%emt 0:07:05]} ({After the game
Ding said that he would have gone for d3-d4 over here.} 27. d4 exd4 28. Rxd4
Nc5 29. Nd5 $14) 27... Nc5 {[%emt 0:00:12] The other knight has settled on c5,
but White's knight on e3 has quite a lot of scope as well. He will jump to d5
and then to b4 and c6 or he can go to d1 and c3. In general White has more
ideas. Also the a4 pawn can become weak at some point.} 28. Nd5 {[%emt 0:02:57]
} Kf8 {[%emt 0:01:49]} 29. f4 {[%emt 0:00:02] Wesley starts turning the screws
on the kingside as well.} Ra5 {[%emt 0:03:00]} 30. Nb4 {[%emt 0:01:39]} Raa8 {

00:40] Bringing the king to defend d3 is a good idea. The rooks are now free
to do something better.} f6 {[%emt 0:02:19]} 33. f5 {[%emt 0:07:57] At this
point I entered the tournament hall and saw that Wesley was looking extremely
focused and confident. Ding on the other hand was a tad nervous.} Kd7 {[%emt 0:
00:13]} 34. g4 {[%emt 0:00:20] White's plan is simple â€” go for a kingside
breakthrough with g5.} Rh8 {[%emt 0:03:18]} 35. h4 {[%emt 0:01:40]} h6 {

to make a lot of moves before going for this break. But Wesley makes this
breakthrough on move 38, just two moves away from the time control and having
just one and a half minutes on his clock. A bold decision for sure.} hxg5 {

really better for White. But I think it can also end at this point, saying
that Wesley should have gone for this variation irrespective of whether he is
winning or not because he has the best chances to press here. According to the
official commentator Mirochnichenko, White can put his rook on g6 and then try
for something like b4-c5. Although I am not really sure as both rooks can
penetrate after b4 and start perpetual checks. What do you think?}) 43... Kd7 (
