1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. d4 Bb4 {The Ragozin: known to me as the
opening which won Jonathan Hawkins his first British national title.} 5. cxd5 {
5.Bg5 and 5.e3 are also played.} exd5 6. Bf4 (6. Bg5 {is the main move, and
after} h6 7. Bh4 c5 {the current fashion is for the ambitious} 8. dxc5 $5) 6...
Ne4 7. Qa4+ {A second minor move in a row by Peter Svidler lands him not in
completely new territory but certainly in slight danger.} (7. Rc1 {was a more
solid move in an obvious ideological precedent.} Nc6 8. Nd2 g5 9. Be3 Nxc3 10.
bxc3 Bd6 $132 {Svane,R-Socko,B Germany 2016}) 7... Nc6 8. Rc1 O-O 9. g3 (9. h4
{was necessary if a little uncomfortable. There could follow} Bg4 10. e3 Qe7
11. Be2 $11) (9. e3 g5 10. Bg3 h5 11. h4 g4 12. Ne5 Bxc3+ 13. Rxc3 (13. bxc3
Nxg3 14. fxg3 Qe7 $17) 13... Nxc3 14. bxc3 Nxe5 15. Bxe5 Bf5 $15 {Ermenkov,
E-Shyam,S Albena 2015}) 9... g5 10. Be3 f5 (10... Bxc3+ 11. bxc3 f5 {was a
marginally more precise order.}) 11. Bg2 {Kind of a wasted move since White
will never get to castle.} (11. Bd2 $5 Bxc3 12. Bxc3 {was an additional option
granted by Black's last.}) 11... f4 12. gxf4 (12. Bd2 {can be met in various
ways, including} g4 13. Ne5 Bxc3 14. bxc3 Nxd2 15. Kxd2 Nxe5 16. dxe5 fxg3 $15)
12... Bxc3+ 13. bxc3 gxf4 14. Bd2 Kh8 $1 $17 {The absolute best move. After
less than 15 moves White has no castling prospects and is close to lost.} 15.
Qb3 $2 {Not helping.} (15. Rg1 Be6 16. Bf1 {is one way of trying to get
belated counterplay.}) ({After} 15. O-O Qf6 $1 {White will be unable to form a
coherent defence against doubling on the g-file.}) 15... Na5 {Unfortunately,
this natural move gains a great many tempi.} 16. Qc2 Nc4 {The obvious threat
is ...Bg4 trapping the d2-bishop, but there are others.} 17. Rd1 Rg8 (17... Qe7
{is most favoured by machines, which want to continue ...Bf5 and ...Rae8, but
it is much of a muchness by now.}) 18. Ne5 Nxe5 19. Bxe4 Qg5 (19... dxe4 20.
Bxf4 Ng6 21. Bg3 {is also dead, but the game might last a bit longer since
White has a good bishop.}) 20. Bxf4 Qxf4 21. Bxd5 Bf5 $1 {It's a clear piece
and maybe even more. A shame that Svidler was not able to demonstrate his
usual good chess today.} 0-1
