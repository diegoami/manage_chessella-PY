1. Nf3 {Bu chooses the most solid way to start a game.} e6 2. c4 d5 {Many
strong players already did not like Magnus' opening choice. According to them,
he should have gone for something non-symmetrical and avoid
theoretical lines.} 3. d4 Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Qc2 {Now we are in the main
line of the Meran. Although it is well known for being a complex opening,
white has many ways to go for a very safe and uncomplicated position.} b6 (6...
Bd6 {is the main line.}) 7. Be2 Bb7 8. O-O Bd6 9. e4 Nxe4 10. Nxe4 dxe4 11.
Qxe4 Nf6 12. Qc2 {White is threatening c5.} c5 $1 {A good move by Magnus who
has activated his light squared bishp, which is more often than not a problem
in this opening.} 13. Qa4+ Nd7 14. Rd1 O-O $6 (14... Qc7 $1 $15 {Magnus was
not on the top of his game. Otherwise he would have surely chosen this move.})
15. Ne5 $1 $16 {Once Bu Xiangzhi made this move, he became very comfortable
about his position.} (15. dxc5 Nxc5 $15) 15... Nf6 16. dxc5 bxc5 17. Nd7 $1 {
A move which Magnus most probably missed.} Ne4 18. Rxd6 $1 (18. Nxf8 $2 Bxh2+
19. Kxh2 Qh4+ 20. Kg1 Qxf2+ 21. Kh2 Nd2 $19) 18... Nxd6 19. Nxf8 Qxf8 20. Be3
$6 (20. Bd3 $14 {A highly pleasant position for White, who not only has the
bishop pair, but also a superior pawn structure. This move stops Nf5-d4.})
20... Nf5 $1 $11 21. Rd1 Nxe3 22. fxe3 {Although the position is equal now,
Black is in big trouble because he is in a must win situation and with every
exchange, his chances diminish.} h6 23. Rd7 Be4 24. Rxa7 Rb8 25. b3 Qd8 26.
Qd7 Qf6 27. Rc7 Qa1+ 28. Kf2 Kh7 {Magnus gets desperate. But how else is he
going to create chances?} 29. Qxf7 Qb2 30. Qf4 (30. Qxe6 Rf8+ 31. Rf7 $16)
30... Bd3 31. Rxg7+ $1 {Of course, Bu Xiangzhi had seen this from quite a
distance.} Kxg7 32. Qc7+ Kg6 33. Qg3+ {There is no way to get out of the
perpetual.} 1/2-1/2
