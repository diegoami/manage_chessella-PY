Nf3 c5 (2... e6 {One could also start with this move order.} 3. Bf4 c5 4. c3 {with a similar position as in the game.}) 3. c3 e6 4. Bf4 Nc6 5. e3 d5 {Very simple play by Black. He places his pawns on c5-d5-e6, gets his knights out on f6 and c6.} 6. Nbd2 Bd6 7. Bg3 (7. Bxd6 Qxd6 {Followed by a subsequent e5 is of course very good for Black.}) 7... O-O 8. Bd3 b6 $1 {The bishop will stand well on b7. Later it will help in creating additional control on e4.} 9. Ne5 $5 {This is usually the ambitious way to play for White. He would like to go f4 and then try for a kingside attack.} Bb7 10. O-O Rc8 11. Qe2 Qc7 12. f4 {Black was waiting for White to make this move. Once f4 is played Black embarks on a very instructive journey with his pieces.} Ne7 $1 { [%cal Ge7f5,Gd6e7,Gf5d6,Gd6e4,Gf6e4,Gb7e4] The knight plans to go to f5, the bishop drops back to e7 and the knight comes to d6. With both the knights on f6 and d6 looking into e4, it should be a very comfortable position for Black.} 13. Qf3 Nf5 14. Bf2 Be7 15. Rad1 Nd6 16. Bh4 Nfe4 $15 {We could go on and on but suffice it to say that Black has not only equalized but has a very clear edge in this position. Later Korobov went on to win the game.} 0-1
