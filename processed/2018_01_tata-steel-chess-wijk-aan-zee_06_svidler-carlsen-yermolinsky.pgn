1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 Bb4 $5 {Back in the day we used to call it a Poor Man's Nimzo,
but, in fact, it is a fully playable line.} 3. Qb3 c5 ({The more solid} 3...
Ba5 {was seen in Giri-Kramnik earlier in this tournament.}) 4. Nb5 $5 {This
extravagant move has been known for some time. I'm sure Carlsen counted on it
in his preparation.} Nc6 5. Nd6+ Kf8 (5... Ke7 $5 6. Qg3 Kf8 {is an
interesting nuance. The white queen may find herself not supported by other
pieces, and therefore, out of place on the K-side.}) 6. Nf3 $6 {It is funny to
even question this natural developing move, but the thing is, that knight is
going to be driven back!} ({Instead, let's take a look at one possible
alternative.} 6. g3 Qe7 7. Nxc8 Rxc8 8. Bg2 Nf6 9. Nf3 e5 10. O-O e4 $6 ({
More reasonable is} 10... g6 11. d3 Kg7 $14) 11. Ne1 Nd4 12. Qd1 {[#] It may
seem from a casual glance that Black have made some progress, but his position
has a rotten foundation. The absence of a light-squared bishop, a stray bishop on b4, uncastled king and
disconnected rooks do not inspire confidence in his success in the long run.
One thing left to do is to play} h5 {and hope for the best.}) 6... Qe7 7. Nxc8
Rxc8 8. e3 e5 $5 {Carlsen is absolutely right: Black must act fast and disrupt
White's smooth development.} ({In that respect} 8... g5 $5 {also comes into
consideration.}) 9. Qc2 e4 10. Ng1 Nf6 11. Ne2 Ba5 12. a3 h5 $1 {A remarkable
move. It serves as a deterrent against White's idea of fianchettoing his light-squared bishop,
and prepares a possibility of development for the h8-rook.} (12... d5 13. cxd5 Nxd5 14.
Ng3) 13. b3 (13. g3 $2 h4) 13... Rd8 {Magnus prepares to open the d-file to
pressurize d2.} ({He could have done so right away,} 13... d5 14. cxd5 Nxd5 15.
Ng3 (15. Bb2 Ncb4 16. axb4 Nxb4 17. Qb1 Nd3+ 18. Kd1 Nxf2+ 19. Ke1 Nd3+ 20. Kd1
{would give Black a choice between a draw by repetition, and a more ambitious
try} Bb4 $5) 15... Nf6 16. h4 {and play} Rd8 {then. Either way, Black is
getting some play, and possibly, more!}) 14. Bb2 d5 15. cxd5 Rxd5 16. O-O-O $1
{[#] Excellent play by Svidler. With the black rook off the c-file he is safe
against all Nb4 tricks.} Ng4 $1 {Once again Carlsen shows his deep
understanding of dynamic factors.} ({A slow approach, such as} 16... h4 17. Nf4
Rd8 {would allow White to switch to positional tracks with} 18. Bb5 $5 Bc7 19.
Bxc6 bxc6 20. d3 $14) 17. Ng3 $5 {Peter Svidler is no stranger to tactical
battles. He knows the value of being the one in the driver's seat.} ({He
rejected} 17. Nf4 Rf5 18. Nh3 {most likely on account of} c4 $1 ({Not} 18...
Nxf2 19. Nxf2 Rxf2 20. Bc4 f6 21. Bd5 $14) 19. b4 (19. Bxc4 b5 {look out for
that rook coming to c5!}) 19... Bxb4 20. axb4 Nxb4 21. Qa4 b5 {with big
intiative for Black.}) 17... Nxf2 18. Bc4 Nxd1 19. Rxd1 Rg5 $1 {The white
knight had to be kept off f5.} 20. Rf1 {[#] This looks very difficult to
defend, but no worries, it's Magnus at the controls.} Nd8 $1 (20... f6 $2 21.
Nxe4 Rxg2 22. Nxf6 $1 $18) 21. Nf5 ({With no target present on f6} 21. Nxe4 {
is pointless:} Rxg2 $15) 21... Qd7 22. Qxe4 Rg4 {Carlsen's move forces White's
hand.} (22... b5 23. Bd5 h4 24. Qf3 {is very much unclear.}) 23. Bxg7+ {
After some consideration Svidler decided to wrap up this exciting game.} ({
I can't blame him for taking a draw, as} 23. Qc2 Rxg2 24. Bxg7+ Rxg7 25. Nxg7 {
would have led to an ending,} Qxd2+ ({no need to allow} 25... Kxg7 $6 26. b4 $1
) 26. Qxd2 Bxd2+ 27. Kxd2 Kxg7 28. Ke2 b6 29. Rd1 Nc6 30. Rd7 Ne5 31. Rxa7 Rh6
{where chances are about even.}) 23... Rxg7 24. Nxg7 Qxd2+ {All is forced now.}

Kh6 31. Qf4+ {With draws like this, who needs decisive games?} 1/2-1/2
