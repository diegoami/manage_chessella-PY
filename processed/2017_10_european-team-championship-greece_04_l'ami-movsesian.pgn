{Now for a brief look at some completely diferent games. This one caught my
eye for a gutsy exchange sacrifice by White, who is maybe best known as an
ex-winner of the famous Reyjkavik open tournament.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3
d5 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bxf6 Qxf6 7. Qa4+ Nc6 8. e3 O-O 9. Rc1 ({According
to what I understand the main line is} 9. Be2 Bd7 (9... dxc4 10. O-O Bxc3 11.
bxc3 Bd7 12. Qxc4 $14 {Aronian,L -So,W, Saint Louis 2017}) 10. Qc2 (10. Qb3 {
is played too}) 10... dxc4 11. O-O Bd6 {as in Harika,D-Hou,Y, Rhodes 2013})
9... Qg6 10. Qc2 Qxc2 11. Rxc2 Rd8 12. a3 Bf8 {So, Black has equalised, at
least to my mind. The question is whether anyone cares. These days Carlsen,
Aronian and even Kramnik seem to be much more about outplaying people later
than huge preparation, though the 'other' type of elite like Giri, Caruana,
Anand continue to exist in equal numbers.} 13. Nb5 Rd7 14. h4 {Stopping ...g5
ideas, which doesn't look like much but is a big deal. What White might
secretly want now is to be pushed back with ...a6, so that a later Nc5! packs
a bit more punch...} a6 15. Nc3 Rd8 16. g4 $6 (16. cxd5 exd5 17. Bd3 (17. Na4 {
would have been consistent, and maybe intended, but also not best.}) 17... g6
18. g3 {White definitely has more 'ideas' here. The king can go to g2, the Nf3
to c5, the rooks can be doubled or not, maybe b4...}) (16. Be2 dxc4 17. Bxc4
Bd6 {is just equal.}) (16. c5 g6 $1 {is not what White is looking for.}) 16...
g6 (16... dxc4 17. Bxc4 e5 {was a tactical opportunity that will not knock
twice.}) 17. cxd5 exd5 18. Bh3 {Back under control.} Ne7 19. Na4 c6 20. Nc5 Rb8
21. Ke2 Kg7 22. Nd3 (22. b4 $5 $14) 22... Ng8 23. g5 h5 24. Nfe5 Ne7 $11 {
Very good neutralisation by Black, who seems to be equal again.} 25. Bxc8 Nxc8
26. Rh3 Bd6 27. Rf3 Bxe5 28. dxe5 (28. Nxe5 Nd6 {was possible, but would fail
to keep 'a little something' in the position.}) 28... Ne7 29. Rf6 Ng8 30. f4 $1
{Exclamation mark for the Dutch courage! The conception is amazing, and not
well understood by engines, and to do this in a team tournament... as we shall
see it may not have improved White's position, but the nerve is admirable!} (
30. Rd6 Ne7 $11) (30. Rf4 Ne7 31. Nc5 Nf5 32. e6 {was relatively pedestrian
and probably equal.}) 30... Nxf6 (30... Re8 {It takes a special kind of sadist
to do this — " I see your sacrifice, and I raise you a cold shoulder" —
from a psychological point of view this move would have been fantastic. White
might struggle to arrange a favourable f5, and Black can if he wishes take
later, or else play ...Ne7-f5 anyway.}) 31. gxf6+ Kh6 32. Rc1 {The idea is
simple. Rg1-g5, f5, Nf4 if/when it threatens Rxh5 or Rxg6.} Rbc8 $5 {A good
defence.} (32... Re8 33. Rg1 b6 {...c5 will come soon, so White should hurry.}
34. f5 (34. Rg5 Rg8 $15) (34. Kf3 $5 {Leads to one of the most amazing
perpetuals I have ever seen.} c5 35. f5 c4 36. e6 $3 cxd3 37. exf7 Re4 (37...

continues, but Black has his counterchances.}) 33. Rg1 Rg8 34. Nc5 Rc7 {
Black seems to have adequately defended against both mate and pawn-grabbing.
Now comes:} 35. f5 $1 g5 $6 (35... Rcc8 $3 {A hard defensive move to spot.} 36.

the best he can do.} 39. Kd3 Rexe7 40. fxe7 Rxe7 41. Kd4 $11) 36. e6 g4 $1 37.
e7 $1 $16 {White gets the same bind without sacrificing his knight. A later
Ne6 could well be crushing too.} Re8 38. Kf2 b6 39. Nd3 c5 40. Nf4 Rd7 41. Rd1
