1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nxc3 6. dxc3 {Karjakin has
had a lot of success in this line, which he has always played against the
Petroff since the early days of his career. Among others, Sergey defeated
Kramnik and Gelfand. Interestingly enough, three of his losses came at the
hands of another participant of this tournament, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov!} Nc6 7.
Be3 Be7 8. Qd2 Be6 9. O-O-O Qd7 10. a3 $5 {Not a very popular move, but
Karjakin had a plan.} ({Since Fabiano does not employ the Petroff that often,
he has faced this position only once. Vachier-Lagrave (London Classic 2016)
played} 10. b3 O-O-O 11. Nd4 {and here Fabiano replied with} a6 $5 12. Nxe6
fxe6 {giving White the Bishop pair. Eventually, the game was drawn, as MVL had
to worry about his king safety.}) ({White shouldn't hurry with} 10. Nd4 { as
Black can change his plans regarding his king's placement:} Nxd4 11. Bxd4 Qa4
12. a3 O-O) 10... h6 (10... O-O-O 11. Nd4 Nxd4 $2 12. Bxd4 {double attacks a7
and g7.}) 11. Nd4 Nxd4 ({Now} 11... O-O-O 12. Nxe6 fxe6 13. g3 d5 {doesn't look
so attractive to Black who doesn't have any play against the white king on the
dark squares.}) 12. Bxd4 Rg8 13. Be2 c5 {Practically forced.} ({Else} 13... b6
14. c4 O-O-O 15. Rhe1 {offers White some edge due to the drafty residence of
the black king.}) 14. Be3 d5 15. f4 O-O-O 16. Bf3 Bg4 {[#] Fabiano is looking
to relieve pressure by trading bishops.} ({Black had} 16... f5 {but that would
mean accepting a slightly worse position for many moves to come.}) 17. Bxd5 $3
{Excellent decision from Sergey, who really knows how to handle decisive games.
The value of this move lies in creating an extremely unpleasant situation for
Fabiano. Objectively Black may not be much worse, but he finds it hard to
develop any play.} ({Of course, not} 17. Qxd5 $2 Qxd5 18. Rxd5 Bxf3 19. Rxd8+
Rxd8 20. gxf3 Rd5) 17... Bxd1 18. Rxd1 Qc7 19. c4 Rge8 20. Qf2 b6 ({Perhaps}
20... f5 {was the better choice.}) 21. g4 $1 (21. Bxf7 $2 { falls into a trap:}
Rxd1+ 22. Kxd1 Bh4) 21... Bf6 (21... Bd6 {can be answered by} 22. Kb1 {since
now} Rxe3 23. Qxe3 Bxf4 24. Qd3 $1 Kb8 (24... Bxh2 $4 25. Bb7+) 25. h3 {offers
White long-term attacking chances. With opposite-colored bishops safety of the
kings is paramount.}) 22. Kb1 Rd7 23. Rd3 {Imagine yourself in Caruana's place.
He has no active play and he has to wait and see while Karjakin improves his
position. Eventually White can strike with b2-b4 or advance his h-pawn.} g5 $6
{I can understand why Fabiano played this move, but it's just not good enough.}
24. Ka2 Ree7 25. Qf3 Kd8 26. Bd2 Kc8 27. Qf1 $1 Rd6 {Now White wins the second
pawn, and, more importantly, gets a passer on the h-file.} ({On} 27... Kd8 28.
Rh3 {breaks down Black's defenses.}) 28. fxg5 Bxg5 29. Bxg5 hxg5 30. Qf5+ Rdd7
31. Qxg5 Qe5 32. Qh6 Kd8 ({The endgame after} 32... f6 33. h4 Kc7 34. g5 Rh7
35. Qg6 Rdg7 36. Qxf6 Qxf6 37. gxf6 Rd7 38. f7 Rd8 39. Rf3 Rf8 40. Rf4 {is near
hopeless for Black, as his rooks are doomed to passivity.}) 33. g5 $1 {In mild
time trouble (actually, Caruana had less time) Karjakin remains precise.} Qd6
34. Qh8+ Re8 35. Qh4 Qg6 36. Qg4 Re5 37. h4 Ke7 38. Rd2 {Not a bad move,}
({while both} 38. Qg3 Qf5 39. Rf3) ({and the immediate} 38. Bxf7 Qf5 (38...
Qf5) 39. Rxd7+ Kxd7 40. Qd1+ {were also winning. }) 38... b5 {[#] Now Sergey
finds a techical solution, which wins slowly but surely.} 39. Bxf7 $5 Qf5 40.

Black's defenses are hopelessly stretched.} 1-0
