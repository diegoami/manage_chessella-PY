Nc3 {Not best. White's idea is logical, and wants to trade off what few Black
pieces are actually participating in the battle, but there was no need to rush
to this just yet, and he could have worked on debilitating Black's position
still while the latter is tied up.} (23. a5 $1) 23... Ng6 24. Qc4 (24. Rxe6+
