1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 a6 $5 {Until recently, it was not possible
to see this move in the top level chess (with several notable exceptions such
as one Staunton's 1843 game). But times change! Today's top guys can play,
generally, just anything that is not refuted by their computers during home
preparation.} 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bg5 Be6 7. e3 Nbd7 8. Bd3 h6 9. Bh4 g5 {This is
a topical line, first played with black by GM Fedoseev in 2016.} 10. Bg3 Nh5
11. Be5 {But now Caruana comes up with something unusual.} Nhf6 $5 ({Instead,} 
11... Ng7 {was tested in many games last year.}) 12. Bg3 ({White also had
more active moves around here. After} 12. Qb3 {curious is} g4 13. Bxf6 Qxf6 14.
Ne5 Nxe5 15. dxe5 Qxe5 16. Qxb7 Rd8 17. Qc6+ Ke7 18. O-O {where Black can even
consider} Kf6 $5 {, planning to hide his king on g7.}) 12... Nh5 13. Nd2 Nxg3
14. hxg3 Nb6 ({Other ideas were} 14... c5 $5 {and 14...c6.}) 15. Qc2 Bd6 ({
Better could have been} 15... c6 {after which} 16. e4 {is premature because of}
dxe4 {and the d4 pawn falls.}) 16. e4 $1 {Now White develops the initiative.}
dxe4 ({Possibly preferable was} 16... Qd7 $5 {, and if} 17. e5 Be7 {.}) 17.
Bxe4 Qe7 $2 ({Black had to play} 17... c6 {with a surely somewhat worse
position. (Karjakin intended to continue} 18. O-O-O $1 {). But instead Caruana
blunders a pawn.}) 18. Bxb7 $3 Rb8 ({It turns that all discovered checks lead
Black nowhere. For example,} 18... Bd5+ 19. Kf1 Bxb7 20. Re1 $18) 19. Bc6+ Kf8
20. O-O Qf6 21. Nf3 Kg7 22. Rfe1 Rhd8 23. Ne4 Qg6 24. d5 $1 {An energetic way
of converting the advantage. White gives his extra pawn back, but prevents ...
Nd5 and develops a crushing intiative.} Nxd5 25. Bxd5 Bxd5 26. Qc3+ f6 27. Nxd6
cxd6 28. Nd4 $1 $18 {Black simply has too many weaknesses, including the
vulnerable king.} Rd7 29. Qa5 Bf7 30. b3 Ra8 31. Rac1 d5 32. Rc7 Rxc7 33. Qxc7
Qd3 34. Ne6+ Kg6 35. Nd8 Rxd8 36. Qxd8 {And White converts his extra exchange.}
Qd2 37. Qe7 Qxa2 38. Re3 Qb1+ 39. Kh2 Qf5 40. Qc7 d4 41. Re7 Qd5 42. b4 Be6 43.
Qb6 Bf7 44. Qxa6 d3 45. Re3 Qc4 46. Qa3 {Black's d3 pawn falls, it's nothing
to play for anymore.} 1-0
