Nf3 Bg4 4. e3 {A passive continuation. Valery Bronznik writes, "White protects both c4 and d4 pawns, but locks up his queen's bishop and does not exert any pressure on Black's centre."} ({The modern preference is for} 4. cxd5 Bxf3 5. gxf3 Qxd5 6. e3 e6 {with a complex game.}) 4... e6 {This is not bad.} ({However,} 4... e5 {is sharper.}) 5. Qb3 Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Bxf3 7. gxf3 Nge7 8. Bd2 O-O 9. O-O-O {Capa goes for a hand to hand combat with kings castled on opposite sides.} (9. Bd3 dxc4 10. Bxc4 Qd6 { is OK for Black.}) 9... Rb8 10. h4 dxc4 11. Bxc4 b5 12. Bd3 Bxc3 13. Bxc3 Nd5 $2 {It's hard to believe that this obvious move can be a mistake. Unfortunately, it weakens the position of the knight on c6 and soon one of the White rooks occupies the c-file.} (13... Qd6 {followed by...a5 would have given Black sufficient counterplay.}) 14. Bd2 {Capa wants to preserve his bishops.} Rb6 15. Kb1 a5 16. Rc1 Qa8 $2 {Black is in a hurry to attack the White king.} (16... Qf6 {followed by...Rd8 would have given him a playable position, though White still enjoys an advantage.}) 17. Rc5 a4 {Sending the queen just where she wants to be!} (17... Rfb8 {was the lesser evil.}) 18. Qc2 $18 {White only needs to make one more move, 19.Rfc1 and Black's position collapses like house of cards.} b4 {A gamble for a swift attack on the king.} 19. Qd1 $2 {Returning the compliment. Capa is overcautious.} ({He would have won a pawn with} 19. Bxh7+ Kh8 20. Qd3 {Probably he was wary of complications after} Nc3+ $5 {Here is a possible line,} 21. Bxc3 bxc3 22. Rh5 Rxb2+ 23. Ka1 g6 24. Bxg6+ Kg7 25. Qxc3 Rb3 $5 26. Rh7+ Kxg6 27. Qc2+ {with a raging attack.} ) 19... Rfb8 20. Ka1 Na5 $2 {Here is the second gamble that should have cost him the game.} 21. Bc4 $2 {White needs to safeguard a2. But this is the wrong way to do it.} ({Again he would have won a pawn and the game with} 21. Qxa4 $1 $18 {Now the tide turns.}) 21... Nb3+ $1 $19 22. Bxb3 axb3 23. Qxb3 Ra6 24. Rb1 Rbb6 25.
