16. Ne2 b5 17. d4 exd4 18. Nxd4 {With his trademark deceptive opening play
Kramnik has achieved a favourable structure. The only piece of the puzzle
missing from this picture is his Nd2 that should have really been on c3 to
prevent the d6-d5 idea.} Rc8 19. N4f3 $6 ({An attempt to maintain control with
} 19. Re3 {could be met with} d5 20. e5 Nfe4 21. f4 f6) 19... d5 $1 {[#] Seeing
how solid Ding has been in this tournament so far, we may forget he's an
accomplished Kings Indian player!} 20. exd5 Rxe1 21. Rxe1 cxd5 {It looks
logical to open the c-file for Rc8 against the white queen.} ({However, the
immediate} 21... Bf5 22. Qd1 Nd3 {was even stronger. White then would be facing
a grim defensive task down the exchange, as} 23. Bxf6 Bxf6 24. Rf1 { is simply
unbearable.}) 22. cxb5 {Now at least White has the favourable pawn structure
which should help him to survive when he goes down material.} Bf5 23. Qd1 Nd3
24. Bd4 Rc1 25. Qxc1 Nxc1 26. Rxc1 Ne4 27. Nf1 Bxd4 $2 {Ding misses his
chance.} ({Instead,} 27... Bd7 $1 {would have set up a great tactical shot: }
28. a4 ({Likely White would have to grovel for a draw after} 28. Bxg7 Kxg7 29.
N3d2 Nxd2 30. Nxd2) 28... Bxd4 29. Nxd4 Nxf2 $1 30. Kxf2 Qf6+ {winning the rook
in case of both} 31. Ke3 ({and} 31. Nf3 Qb2+) 31... Qg5+) 28. Nxd4 Qb6 29. Bxe4

uncompromising approach to this tournament Kramnik keeps on pushing for a win.
This time there's enough safety margin in the position for him to get away with
that.} hxg4 57. h5+ Kf7 58. Rd7+ Ke6 59. Rg7 Qe2 60. h6 Qf3+ 61. Kg1 g3 62.
Rxg3 Qh5 63. Rg7 f5 ({Of course,} 63... Qxh6 $4 {would seem to be a gross
blunder since the queen is lost after} 64. Re7+ Kxe7 65. Nf5+ Ke6 66. Nxh6 {
What is funny is that White still can't win after} f5 $1 {The reason is that
the knight is trapped.} 67. Kf1 Kf6 68. Kg2 f4 $1 {is the correct
continuation.} ({The tempting} 68... Kg6 {would actually lose after} 69. Ng8
Kf7 70. Kg3 $1 {and the black pawns will fall and White will have the
opposition to boot.}) 69. Ng4+ Kf5 70. Nh2 Ke5 71. Kf1 Kf5 72. Ke2 Kg5 73. Nf1
Kf5 {and White cannot progress. The minute White tries to free his knight with}
