1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. c3 Nf6 4. Be2 Nbd7 5. Qc2 $6 {The young Iranian player
surprised me with this choice.} ({I expected} 5. d3 b6 6. O-O Bb7 7. Nbd2 { and
here I was going to play} e6 ({avoiding} 7... g6 8. d4 $5 {as in the famous
game Svidler-Kasparov, Tilburg 1997.})) 5... Qc7 6. O-O e6 {going for
Scheveningen structures.} ({According to databases} 6... g6 {is more popular,
but I guess it is largely a matter of choice.}) 7. c4 $5 (7. a4 b6 8. a5 Bb7 9.
d3 bxa5 $6 10. Qa4 c4 {was seen in Rozentalis-Jones, Gausdal 2007. I can't say
I'm thrilled with Black's ideas.}) 7... Be7 8. Nc3 a6 9. b3 b6 10. Bb2 O-O 11.
Rfe1 Bb7 12. d4 cxd4 13. Nxd4 {OK, what we have here is a standard Hedhehog
with a couple of extra tempi for Black, which is rather unimportant.} Rac8 14.
Bf1 Rfe8 15. Rac1 Qb8 16. Qd2 Nc5 $5 {The typical breaks b6-b5 and d6-d5 are
ineffective, it not outright impossible, until White weakens his position with
pawn moves. Therefore I decided to sacrifice back the tempi gifted to me in the
opening.} 17. f3 Ncd7 18. a3 Bd8 {Strictly speaking, this is unnecessary.}
({With his dark-squared bishop out of place on b2 White is unable to pressurize
the b6-pawn after} 18... Bf8 19. b4 Ne5 20. Na4 Ba8 21. Qf2 Ned7 {which leaves
him searching for a plan.}) 19. b4 Bc7 20. f4 {[#] I was hoping to see that.}
({ In case of the more restrained} 20. g3 {I'd have to continue shuffling my
pieces back and forth â€” such is the nature of Hedgehod positions.}) 20... d5 $1
{My star move.} 21. e5 dxc4 {Otherwise Black is busted.} 22. Bxc4 ({On} 22. g3
{I was looking to play} Ng4 ({Actually,} 22... Nxe5 23. fxe5 Bxe5 {is much
stronger. Black has three pawns for a piece, and White is poorly coordinated.})
23. Be2 h5 {It wasn't clear to me how White was going to get his pawn back.})
22... Nxe5 $1 {All part of the plan.} 23. fxe5 Bxe5 24. Nce2 $2 ({I thought he
would try to cut his losses with} 24. Rxe5 Qxe5 $15) 24... Bxh2+ 25. Kh1 {
Another surprise.} ({I was mainly looking at} 25. Kf1 {to keep the king out of
mating nets. My intention was} Qa8 26. Ng1 e5 $1 27. Nf5 Bf4 {regaining some
material and heading for a technical stage after} 28. Qe2 Bxc1 29. Rxc1 Bd5)
25... Ng4 26. Rf1 {[#]} Qe5 $2 ({Here I hit the wall. The longer I looked at}
26... Bg1 27. Qf4 {the worse it seemed. The solution was there in the form of a
simple trade.} Qxf4 28. Nxf4 (28. Rxf4 Be3 {I missed that one, I don't know
how.} 29. Rxg4 Bxc1 30. Bxa6 Bxb2 31. Bxb7 Rc7 32. Bf3 Rc4 $19) 28... Be3 29.
Rc2 {and now a pleasant choice between two winning moves.} Bxf4 ({or} 29... e5
30. Nfe2 Nf2+ 31. Rxf2 Bxf2 32. Nf5 Be4 33. Nd6 Bxc2 34. Bxf7+ Kf8 35. Bxe8
Rxe8 36. Nxe8 Kxe8 37. Bxe5 Kf7) 30. Rxf4 Ne3 31. Bd3 e5 32. Rh4 Nxc2 33. Bxh7+
Kf8 34. Nxc2 g6 35. Ne3 Kg7 36. Kg1 Rcd8 {It would have been a very satisfying
victory.}) 27. Nf3 {I actually didn't see this defense.} ({My attention was
focused on} 27. Nf5 Qe4 28. Neg3 Bxg3 29. Nxg3 Qe3 $19) 27... Qh5 28. Qg5 {
That simple... There was nothing left to do but accept a slightly worse
endgame.} Qxg5 29. Nxg5 Be5 30. Bxe5 Nxe5 31. Bb3 h6 $6 (31... Rxc1 $142 32.
Rxc1 h6 33. Nh3 Rd8 {would be more comfortable for Black.}) 32. Rxc8 Bxc8 {
Luckily I had this recapture.} (32... Rxc8 33. Nxe6 $1 {would have turned the
game into a real disaster.}) 33. Ne4 Rd8 34. Rd1 Rxd1+ 35. Bxd1 Kf8 36. N2c3
Ke7 37. Be2 Bb7 38. Kg1 f5 39. Nd2 Kd6 40. Kf2 g5 41. g3 Kc7 42. Ke3 Kd6 $14 {
[#] White is the one playing for a win, but it's hard to make progress without
trading some pawns.} 43. a4 Kc7 44. b5 axb5 45. axb5 Nd7 46. Nc4 e5 47. Bf3 f4+
{I decided to trade down to a notorious 2N vs pawn ending.} (47... e4 48. Be2
Nf6 49. Kd4 f4 50. gxf4 gxf4 51. Bd1 {would allow him to keep the bishop and
some winning chances along with it.}) 48. Kf2 fxg3+ 49. Kxg3 Bxf3 50. Kxf3 Nf6
51. Na4 g4+ 52. Kg3 h5 53. Nxe5 Ne4+ 54. Kf4 Nd6 55. Nc3 Kb7 $1 {It is
important to be able to push the white knight out of the blockade on b5, as the
remaining pawn must be well-advanced to guarantee a draw.} 56. Nd3 Nxb5 57.
Nxb5 Kc6 58. Nc3 b5 59. Kg3 h4+ 60. Kxh4 g3 61. Kxg3 b4 62. Nd1 Kd5 63. N3b2 b3
{I give credit to my young opponent for trying to win this until he ran into
the 50-move rule, although I'll spare the reader the rest of the moves. For
those who are interestred in such endings, I'll mention that the Black king can
only be mated in the h1-corner. In the game I wisely stayed far away from it.}
