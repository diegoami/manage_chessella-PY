1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Bg4 3. Bg2 c6 4. O-O e6 5. h3 Bh5 6. d3 {Just six moves into
the game and we already have a position that has been played only once before.}
Nd7 7. e4 Bd6 8. exd5 cxd5 9. c4 Ne7 {The knight on f6 can be pushed away with
g4-g5 and hence Black prefers to develop it on e7.} 10. Nc3 O-O 11. cxd5 exd5
12. g4 Bg6 13. Nh4 Nb6 14. Bg5 $1 Qd7 (14... f6 15. Nxg6 Nxg6 16. Be3 $14) 15.
a4 $1 Rae8 16. a5 Na8 17. Nxg6 Nxg6 18. Qa4 (18. Nxd5 Nc7 $44 {gives Black fine
compensation for the pawn.}) 18... Qe6 19. Bd2 Qe5 20. f4 Bc5+ 21. Kh1 Qb8 22.
Nxd5 Bd6 23. Qd4 Rd8 24. Bc3 f6 25. g5 $1 {Black's position is falling apart.}

Rxc4 32. dxc4 Ng3+ 33. Kg1 Ne2+ 34. Kh2 Nxf4 35. Kh1 {Black is a rook down and
completely lost â€“ he decided to throw in the towel. Maybe this was the most
accurate game played by Sanan Sjugirov in his entire career. Every move he made
was almost the top choice of the engine. Just shows how strong this young lad
really is.} 1-0
