1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 b5 {For many players who view White's move order as an
introduction to the Catalan, this is the way to interfere with the opponent's
intentions.} 3. Bg2 ({For the interesting alternative} 3. e3 {see the next
game.}) 3... Bb7 4. O-O c5 5. d3 g6 ({Somewhat more reliable is} 5... e6 { [#]
Black chooses a flexible, Hedgehog-like structure in the center, inviting White
to overextend on the K-side.} 6. e4 d6 7. Nc3 (7. a4 {was Carlsen's choice
against Vachier-Lagrave in Norway Blitz 2015. The game continued} b4 8. Nbd2

a brilliant idea by Magnus. Too bad he spoiled the winning position he obtained
after} Rxf7 15. Bh3 Bd7 16. a5 e5 17. axb6 Bxh3 18. b7 Rb8 19. Bxe5 Rxb7 20.

positions) belongs to Alexander Morozevich. White is hoping to provoke a
weakening move h7-h6 while clearing the f-file out for his pawn storm.} Qc7 10.

17. f5 Rxc1 18. Bxc1 e5 {Grischuk-Leko, Sport Accord Blitz, 2013 went its
logical way at least up to this point, where White should have gone on with}
19. Nxf7 (19. Nf3 $6 d5 20. g5 dxe4 21. Nh2 {and despite having a suspect
position Grischuk went on to win that game.}) 19... Kxf7 20. g5 { keeping the
situation tense and double-edged.}) 6. e4 d6 (6... Bg7 7. e5 Nd5 8. d4 $1 {and
once again, Black's hypermodern double fianchetto is exposed by White's central
strategy.}) 7. d4 $1 {A great move, showing how flexible Kramnik's thinking is.
Forget the Closed Sicilian, we're going to play the g3 Dragon, only without the
white knight on c3. We will see shortly why it is important.} cxd4 (7... Nxe4

immediate} 10. a4 {can come into consideration.}) 10... Bg7 11. a4 $1 b4 {Now
the purpose of delaying Nb1-c3 is revealed. There's no attack on that knight,
and White gets a crucial tempo to do his thing.} 12. a5 O-O 13. Ra4 Bc6 ({In
case of the relatively better} 13... Nc6 {White still stays on top:} 14. N1d2

was history: 1-0 in 57 moves.} 1-0
