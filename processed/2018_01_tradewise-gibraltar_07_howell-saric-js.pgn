eye-watering 55 minutes on 15.Bc3 and 19.Bc3 combined.} Nb5 20. Bd2 Nd6 21. Rc2
({White could have repeated here with} 21. Bc3 {, of course. "Why did you
repeat positions?" "Partly it's to gain time on the clock and partly it's to
show them who's in control," joked Howell.}) 21... h6 22. Kg2 Nc4 23. Bc1 a5

Qb5 Na7 31. Qb3 b5 32. Qd1 a4 {[#]I won't pretend I found the earlier part of
the game particularly riveting. On the whole, I would prefer watching coastal
erosion. Come to think of it, quite a lot of that was taking place outside the
venue as this game was being played. But what was rather more exciting -
nerve-wracking would perhaps be a better description - was watching David's
clock count down to a handful of seconds after each of these moves. Saric was
relatively cushy with nine minutes or so in hand.} 33. b3 b4 {"I miscalculated
his b4 break and was just holding on." (Howell)} 34. axb4 Nb5 35. Rd3 a3 $5 {
A very sharp piece sacrifice to secure a monster passed pawn. Not the sort of
move that most of us would want to see played on the board with barely in
excess of 30 seconds left to find a reply. But David copes with the emergency
situation well.} 36. bxc4 dxc4+ 37. Bf3 Qa6 38. Rd2 a2 {"Did that pawn on a2
worry you?" (interviewer Tania Sachdev) "I've had scarier positions." (Howell)}
39. Bb2 c3 40. Rc2 cxb2 41. Rxb2 Nc3 42. Qa1 {We're now passed the time
control and the players can relax a bit. Black has won back his piece but
remains a pawn down. However, the monster pawn on a2 is worth a lot more.} Qa3
$2 ({It is curious how often players relax and go wrong after a time scramble
is over. This is a serious mistake. Black should play} 42... Rc4 43. Rc1 Rcxb4
$1 44. Rxb4 Rxb4 {when both captures on c3 would lead to an edge for Black, e.
g.} 45. Rxc3 (45. Qxc3 Rb1 46. Qc8+ Qxc8 47. Rxc8+ Kh7 48. Ra8 a1=Q 49. Rxa1
Rxa1) 45... Rb1 46. Rc8+ Qxc8 47. Qxa2 Rc1 {with winning chances. Howell was
surprised at how quickly his opponent played this move, despite having plenty
of time to think about it with the extra time added. "I'm a tricky guy. He
should have realised I had this trick prepared for Rxa2."}) 43. Rc1 $1 Rxb4 $4
{Simply a blunder. There are a number of other safe alternatives, though White
may be a bit better now.} 44. Rxa2 {David Howell thought his opponent must
have overlooked this relatively simple move.} Qxa2 45. Qxa2 Nxa2 46. Rxc8+ Kh7
47. d5 $1 {It wouldn't be so bad if Black had simply lost a pawn but his
pieces are caught in a tangle and White can gain time to win a pawn or perhaps
more.} exd5 {Forced, otherwise the d-pawn will promote.} 48. Rc2 (48. Bxd5 {
is also good enough.}) 48... Ra4 49. Bxd5 Nb4 50. Rc4 Ra5 51. Be4+ f5 52. Rxb4
