d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. h3 e5 7. Nb3 $5 { At the London Chess
Classic almost everyone retreated their knight to e2. The knight to b3
is also one of the main moves but not as popular as Nde2.} Be6 8. f4 Be7
(8... Nbd7 9. f5 Bxb3 10. axb3 d5 $1 {was played by Shirov against Sutovsky
and Black is already completely fine. The point is that Nxd5 is bad as
after Nxd5 there is a check on h4 and direct exd5 is met with Bb4.} 11.
exd5 (11. Nxd5 Nxd5 12. Qxd5 Qh4+) 11... Bb4 $44 {[%cal Gd8b6,Gd7c5]})

11. Qf3 b4 12. Nd5 Nxd5 13. exd5 Bg5 14. Bxg5 Qxg5 15. Bd3 Bb5 16. h4
(16. O-O {could have been more prudent. But knowing what an aggressive
player Nils is, his move with h4 is one that can be expected from him.})
16... Qd8 17. g4 Nd7 18. g5 $6 { According to Giri in the press conference
this was an inaccuracy by White as it allows Black to activate his rook
with h6.} h6 $1 19. Rg1 (19. f6 {Good or bad, this should have been tried.}
gxf6 20. g6 $1 fxg6 21. Bxg6+ Ke7 {Black king looks safe on e7 but after}
22. O-O-O {White is surely the one who can create dangerous threats in
this position.}) 19... hxg5 20. hxg5 Bxd3 21. Qxd3 Rh5 $1 {It seems it
is difficult for White to defend the g5 pawn as Qd2 is met by a5 threatening
a4 when the knight doesn't have the d2 square to retreat. And Qe3 is met
by Qb6.} 22. Qg3 Qc7 23. O-O-O Rc8 {Mate on c2 is threatened.} 24. Rd2

is unclear.} ) 31... Rxh2 32. Rxh2 Kd7 33. Qg1 Qxd5 34. Qa7+ Ke6 35. Qg1

game which is quite typical of the Sicilian.} 0-1
