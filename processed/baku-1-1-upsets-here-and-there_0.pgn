Black could simply play 17...0-0 and enjoy a big advantage, but Kramnik already smells blood.} 17... d4 $1 18. exd4 (18. Nxd4 b4 {drops the knight on c3, because if it moves...} 19. Nce2 Be4 {the queen is lost!}) 18... Bxf3 19. dxc5 Bxd1 20. Qxd1 Rxc5 {White has some minor compensation for the exchange, mainly she can play 21.f3 and Ne4, trying to establish some counterplay. However she tries to counteract immediately.} 21. Qf3 O-O 22. Ne4 Rc4 23. Nf6+ Kg7 24. Bd2 Be5 25. g5 hxg5 26. Nh5+ Kg8 (26... gxh5 27. Bxg5 {only leads to a draw, but Black doesn't have to take the knight, of course.}) 27. Bxg5 Qb4 28. Nf6+ Bxf6 29. Qxf6 {White is threatening 30.Bh6 with mate, but Black has enough time to stop this.} Rg4 $1 30. Rd1 {Allowing a pretty finish} (30. Rxg4 Qxg4 {threatens mate on d1.}) 30... Qe4+ 31. Ka1 Qd5 $1 {The queen is taboo due to the back rank mate, and this costs White her bishop on g5.} 0-1
