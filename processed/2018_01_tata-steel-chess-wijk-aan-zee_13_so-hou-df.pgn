1. c4 e6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. d4 Bb4+ 5. Bd2 Bd6 (5... Be7 {is far more
common. It has a few advantages over the text- for instance, covering the
h4-d8 diagonal; avoiding c5 with tempo, and keeping d5 better covered.} 6. Nf3
(6. Nc3 O-O 7. Nf3 dxc4 {has scored extremely well for Black}) 6... O-O 7. O-O
Nbd7 {We have obtained a standard 'delayed Catalan', as seen for instance in
Karjakin-Wei from this event.}) 6. Nc3 {Trying to make Black take on c4 or
play ...c6, neither of which is particularly favourable.} O-O (6... c6 7. e4

A-Bartel,M Gjakova 2016}) 8. Qxc4 a6 $1 $132 {According to what I can see,
this position has never been viewed, let alone played, but a preliminary
investigation indicates Black is probably okay playing the standard ...Rb8, ...
0-0 and then whichever of ...b5, ...e5 and ...c5 best suits the position.} ({
Meanwhile} 8... O-O 9. Nb5 $14 {is arguably another disadvantage of ...Bd6}))
7. cxd5 {If this forcing approach works, there is no need to analyse anything
else.} (7. e4 {might be another move, as in the Vallejo game above, but here
Black can eventually play ...c5 in one.}) 7... exd5 8. Nxd5 Nxd5 9. Bxd5 Bxg3

15. Ng5 $16) 11. Nf3 c6 (11... Nd7 {might be better, reserving the tempo gain
against the d5-bishop for an actual developing move.} {After the precise} 12.
Rg1 $1 {Black has an interesting choice to make.} Nf6 (12... Nb6 $5 13. Bh6 g6
14. Bxf8 Qxf8 $44 {is not stupid either}) 13. Bc4 (13. Bh6 Ng4 14. Bg5 Be7 $11)
13... Bf5 14. O-O-O (14. Ne5 Bxe5 15. dxe5 Ne4 16. Bh6 Qh4 $1 $132) 14... Qe7
$132 {White's attacking chances are not insignificant, but Black has completed
development and should be fine.}) 12. Bc4 Bf5 $6 {Between them the last two
moves deserve one 'dubious' mark, and I have decided to award it here.} (12...
Nd7 13. Rg1 Nb6 {was once again worth considering, since White runs into some
tactical issues down the road if he takes the exchange}) 13. Ng5 Qe7 14. Qf3 (
14. O-O-O h6 15. e4 $40 {is revealed to be really problematic after some deep
engine analysis, but the text is more natural.}) 14... Bg6 15. h4 Bb4 (15... h5

(17... h6 18. h5 Qxg5 19. hxg6 Qxg6 20. Rdd1 $40 {is really difficult to
believe for Black}) (17... Nd7 18. h5 Qxg5 19. hxg6 Qxg6 {could have been a
bail-out option: the engine recommendation is} 20. Qh3 (20. Rdd1 $5) {but
there could follow} 20... Nf6 21. Bd3 Qh6 {and Black has reached an endgame})
18. Rg1 {The position is now basically objectively winning in a number of ways.
} (18. Qg3 $5 {is a slightly cunning move, cuing up Ne6 (the text does not do
this, because of the x-ray attack from the f8-rook.)}) 18... Nd7 19. Qg3 Nb6
20. Bb3 Qf6 (20... Nd5 21. e4 {does not really do anything to interfere with
the threat of Nxf7.}) 21. e4 Rae8 22. e5 Qf5 23. Bc2 Qg4 24. Bxg6 Qxg3 (24...
