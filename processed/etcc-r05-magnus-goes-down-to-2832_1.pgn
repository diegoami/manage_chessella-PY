Qf3 {[%csl Rf7][%cal Rf3f7,Rc4f7] This position has been reached five times in the past. Some players thought they should defend the f7 point with Be6, some decided Rf8 was important and one guy even 0-0. But then comes Maxime Vachier Lagrave who says, why should the f7 point be defended at all?!} Ne5 $5 16. Bxe5 Qxe5 17. Bxf7+ (17. Qxf7+ {doesn't really change the nature of the position by much.} Kd8 18. hxg5 Qxg5 $44) 17... Kd8 {What has Black got in return for a pawn. Bishop pair, the bishop on g7 is super strong, the rooks can be used on semi open files on f8 and b8 and in general it is much easier to play as Black as his king is safe on d8 while the king on e1 is feeling the heat.} 18. hxg5 Rb8 $1 19. Bb3 Rf8 20. Qe3 Qxg5 21. Qxg5 hxg5 {This endgame promises excellent compensation for Black.} 22. f3 g4 $1 23. Ke2 a5 24. Na4 { White intends to meet Ba6 with c4, but this weakens the dark squares quite a bit and makes the bishop on b3 very passive.} (24. Rad1 {was much better not fearing a check on a6.} Ba6+ 25.
