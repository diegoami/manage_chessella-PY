{The final round's win propelled the English IM to a shared 1st place but the
journey was far from being a smooth one. Looking at the 500 rating difference,
one might jump to the hasty conclusion that Black shouldn't have many troubles
displaying superior knowledge. Practice though is different from theory,
certainly when you are facing an underrated young man from Kazakhstan.} 38... Rxg5 {was played by James but that could have proven a serious mistake. Can
you see why?} ({Instead,} 38... bxc4+ {was the way to go, eliminating White's
alternatives first} 39. Kxc4 {and only now} Rxg5 40. Re6+ Kf7 41. Rxa6 $11 )39. Re6+ {White missed that after} (39. Rxg5+ Kxg5 40. c5 $1 {is available, which
