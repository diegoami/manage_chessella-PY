        22. cxb5 axb5 23. a5 Reb8 {The first new move of the game. The position 
        is quite rich and has a number of features to be considered. That knight 
        on c5 is extremely well placed, however the bishop on b7 and g7 and not 
        particularly active. Also White has greater space. The knight on g3 is 
        passive and relocating it to a better square can be a good idea. All in 
        all I would consider this position to be slightly better for White. But 
        Black has his share of chances.} 24. Bc2 Bc8 25. Rb1 Qd8 26. Qc1 Kh7 27.
