1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. exd5 exd5 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. a3 Ba5 {This is
optimistic. Bxc3 is the move you play if you would like to hold a solid draw.}
7. Nge2 Nge7 8. O-O O-O 9. Bg5 (9. Na4 $5 {demands attention, because the
bishop pair is almost never bad to have. An old game by an (East) German
grandmaster went:} Bf5 10. Nc5 Qc8 11. Bg5 Bb6 12. b4 Bxc5 13. dxc5 Re8 $11 {
Schmittdiel,E-Uhlmann,W Germany 1992}) 9... f6 10. Be3 Bf5 11. Nf4 $6 {The
computer sees no problem with this, but compared to move 6, Black is much
better developed and ready to take advantage of the structural problem this
implies.} Bxc3 12. bxc3 Qd7 13. c4 Bxd3 (13... Na5 {is the engine
recommendation, but the compact structure after} 14. cxd5 Nxd5 15. c4 Nxe3 16.
fxe3 {may be better for White than it thinks.}) 14. Qxd3 Rad8 15. Rab1 (15.
cxd5 Nxd5 16. Nxd5 Qxd5 17. c4 $132 {is worth a look: the blitzy ...Ne5 gets
the knight trapped, and when White gets d5 in his bishop will be of equal
value to the knight.}) 15... b6 16. Rb5 $6 {Now Black is slightly better
already â€” this rook is tactically weak and does not coordinate well with the
rest of the pieces.} dxc4 17. Qxc4+ Rf7 18. Rd1 {This doesn't help either â€” now
everything comes with tempo.} Na5 19. Qd3 c6 20. Rbb1 Qf5 $15 21. a4 (21. Qe2
Nd5 22. Nxd5 cxd5 23. Qd3 {might not be so dreadful}) 21... g5 $1 22. Nh5 Qxd3
23. Rxd3 Nd5 24. Bd2 Nc4 {This position is almost winning at the elite level,
and Mamedyarov's 'tactically informed technique' is nearly perfect.} 25. Re1 h6
26. h4 (26. Re6 Rd6 27. Re8+ Kh7 28. h3 {may have been worth a try, just to
keep two active pieces}) 26... Kh7 27. g4 gxh4 28. Re6 Rd6 29. Rxd6 Nxd6 30. f3

some last bit of optimisation to do.} (38... Nxc2 39. Rc1 (39. Rb1 Nd2 $19)
39... Nd4 40. Kg2 Rxf6 41. Bxf6 Kxf6 42. Rb1 Nb6 {obtains the same position
with the c2-pawn gone.}) 39. Bxf6 Kxf6 40. c3 (40. Kf2 Nxg4+ 41. Kf3 Nge5+ 42.
Kf4 {was the last try to pose practical problems, in my opinion}) 40... Ke6 $19
{Now Black's pieces all have defined roles: the Black king will stop the
b-pawn, and then take it once the a-pawn has distracted White's rook.} 41. b6

there is a tactic instead.}) 48. Rb4 a2 0-1
