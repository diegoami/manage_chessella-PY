dxc4 {The first in a chain of slightly bizarre strategic decisions, though in
fairness it is hard to think straight when you are outrated by 300 points.} (
8... h6 $5 {seems to have been the move chosen by strong players.} 9. cxd5 (9.
Be3 Bc5 10. Bxc5 Qxc5 11. Nbd2 a5 $11 {Romanishin,O-Vysochin,S Ordzhonikidze
2001}) 9... cxd5 10. Nc3 Rc8 11. Be3 Qa6 $11) 9. Qxc4 Bg4 (9... e5 {is the
consistent followup, but White should be marginally better in any case, e.g.}
10. Nbd2 Qc7 11. b3 Bd6 12. Qc3 $5 $14) 10. Nbd2 Be7 11. Qc2 {Clearly, things
have gone a bit wrong and White wants Nc4, followed by maybe Bf4 and Nfe5, but
there was no reason to panic just yet.} Bxf3 (11... O-O 12. Nc4 Qd8 {is a bit
depressing, but more or less fine}) 12. Bxf3 Ne5 13. Bg2 O-O (13... h5 $5 $14 {
tries to get some dynamism for the bishop pair}) 14. b3 (14. b4 $5 {is also
playable, and is even a better move according to the powers that be, but it
would be a weird choice in a game. Unless, of course, the White player was
familiar with Short-Fernandez, British Knockout Ch.2016 (QF, 1st tiebreak
game!)}) 14... c5 (14... Qc5 15. Qxc5 Bxc5 16. Bb2 Ned7 $14 {still limited the
damage}) 15. Nc4 Nxc4 16. bxc4 Qc7 17. Rb1 {White is close to winning now.}
Rab8 18. Bf4 e5 19. Bg5 Ne8 (19... Nd5 $5 {was worth considering, though I
have no doubt that White's attack should prevail after} 20. Bxd5 Bxg5 21. h4
$16) 20. Bd2 Nd6 21. a4 b6 22. Bd5 Nb7 23. Bc3 Bd6 24. e3 Na5 25. f4 Kh8 (25...
Nc6 $16 {made sense, belatedly trying to get to b4 and drum something up}) 26.

(28... f6 29. dxc5 Qxc5 30. Bd4 Qc8 31. Qh5 $16 {was the last try to get some
positional compensation for his tactical woes}) 29. Bxa5 bxa5 30. Rb7 Qd8 31.
