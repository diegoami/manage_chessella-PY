However, that is not what makes the US team a favorite in this event. It also has two strong young players: Sam Shankland and Ray Robson who are close to 2700. Therefore, we can say that the US is balanced and ready to win any match in this event. In this match against the Scottish team, USA team's rating average was almost 300 points above their opponents in 'kilts'. However, in this game experienced Scotch GM Colin McNab almost threw GM Shankland off the cliff.} 1. Nf3 {(0s)} c5 {(0s)} 2. c4 {(30s)} Nf6 {(7s)} 3. g3 { (29s) McNab almost exclusively plays the English.} Nc6 {(13s)} 4. Bg2 {(30s)} d5 {(16s)} 5. cxd5 {(81s)} Nxd5 {(6s)} 6.

It is funny to see that one of the players who played this move is actually the oldest man in Canada!

He also procrastinates a bit in order to make sure that Shankland is not going to play h5-h4 against his kingside castle.} O-O-O {(1460s) After almost 25 minutes of thinking, Shankland decides to put his king in front of a rook on a semi-open file while the h1-a8 diagonal is exposed and White's bishop is in it! Nevertheless, the move is not entirely bad even if he probably would have been better off playing short castle and asking White what he wants to do with his knight on a4!} 13.

McNab does not try to optimize his advantage.
