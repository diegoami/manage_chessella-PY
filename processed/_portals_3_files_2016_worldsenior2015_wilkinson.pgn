{I had lost two of my first three games and was just settling down after
travelling thousands of miles from Jamaica (via three planes and a one-hour
bus drive from Genoa) to Acqui Terme. Being the inaugural (2015) Jamaican
Veterans Champion (50+ year old) and the only "black" man out of several
hundred players, I was determined to show that I knew at least a little bit of
chess. The following game was an exciting one that resulted in my first
victory in a World Chess Championship! The time control was 40 moves in 90
minutes, 30 minutes to complete and increments of thirty seconds per move from
the 1st move.} 1. e4 {Bobby Fischer's favourite move with the white pieces was
not a surprise although, having looked at some of my opponent's games, other
things were possible.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. c3 {Heading into the
Smith-Morra attack/ gambit.} Nf6 {I decided to avoid the murky waters of 4...
dxc3 where White usually piles on sustained pressure for the pawn.} 5. Bd3 {In
a pulsating Jamaican encounter the future national champion chose 5.Qxd4 and I
won a thriller after 5...e6 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Qe4 d6 8.Bb5 Qc7 9.c4 Nb6 10. exd6
