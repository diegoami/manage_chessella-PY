Nf3 e6 3. e3 {Just like Mariya, Zhukova also doesn't want to indulge in hard core theory. Instead she goes for this simple line which is complex and interesting.} b6 4. Bd3 Bb7 5. O-O c5 6. c4 {Following the footsteps of Kramnik. He played the same line against Topalov in the European Club Cup.} Be7 7. Nc3 O-O $6 {It is well known that this is an error and gives White quite a tangible advantage after d5.} (7... cxd4 8. exd4 d5 {is the main line.}) 8. d5 $1 exd5 9. cxd5 d6 (9... Nxd5 10. Nxd5 Bxd5 11. Bxh7+ Kxh7 12. Qxd5 $16) 10. e4 a6 11. a4 Nbd7 12. h3 Re8 13. Bf4 Nf8 14. Nd2 Ng6 15. Bh2 Nd7 16. f4 Bf6 17. Kh1 Bd4 18. Nc4 Nf6 19. Qb3 {White has a great amount of pressure on the position. b6 is weak, the bishop on b7 is passive and the knights on f6 and g6 hardly have any scope. Additionally White has excellent centre control. Naturally Black must do something and she decided to give up her strong bishop on d4.} Bxc3 20. bxc3 Nxe4 (20... Rxe4 21. Bxe4 Nxe4 { was an interesting exchange sac, but after} 22. Nxb6 $16 {White is better.}) 21. f5 Bxd5 (21... Nf8 22. Bxe4 Rxe4 23. Nxd6 Re7 24. f6 $1 $18) 22. fxg6 hxg6 {The nature of position has changed drastically. Black has three pawns for the piece, but clearly in a bad position as the pawns are weak.} 23. Qb2 Qh4 24. Bxe4 Rxe4 25. Nxb6 (25. Nxd6 {was also strong.}) 25... Rb8 26. Qd2 Bc6 27. a5 Rbe8 28. Qxd6 R8e6 29. Qb8+ Kh7 30. Qg3 Qh5 31. c4 g5 32. Rae1 f5 33. Nd5 f4 34. Qd3 Qg6 35. Rxe4 Rxe4 36. Bg1 Bd7 37. Nc3 (37. Nf6+ gxf6 38. Qxd7+ Kg8 39. Rb1 $18) 37... Bf5 {Of course this is desperation. But the position was already lost.} 38. Nxe4 Bxe4 39. Qc3 Qc6 40. Rf2 Qh6 41. Re2 Bf5 42. Qe5 Qg6 ( 42... Bxh3 43. gxh3 Qxh3+ 44. Rh2 $18) 43. Bxc5 g4 44. Bd4 gxh3 45. gxh3 Bxh3 46. Rh2 Qc6+ 47. Qd5 Qh6 48. Qf3 {Gunina played quite a bad game, but all credit to Zhukova who took full advantage of her every error.} 1-0
