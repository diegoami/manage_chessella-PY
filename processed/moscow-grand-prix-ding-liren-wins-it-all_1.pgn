Re2 {(26s)} Kh8 {(6s) Hou Yifan is hardly camouflaging her intent. Kh8 is to free the f-pawn from its pin. Which begs the question, why did White choose to force Black's hand with...} 11. h3 $6 { (0s) The engines can say this move is fine, but I don't like it on principle. Why not let Black show her hand first, and instead continue development with Nf1?} ({If after} 11.
