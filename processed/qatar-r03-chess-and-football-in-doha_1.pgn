1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 {After the game Li Chao mentioned that his opponent always
came to the games well prepared and he just wanted to surprise him and play for
a draw! Quite a surprising statement by a player who is rated 111 Elo points
above his opponent. But he was black and it is not surprising to see top
players being less ambitious with the black pieces.} 3. e3 e5 4. Bxc4 Nc6 $5
(4... exd4 {is much more common and the main move in the position.}) 5. d5 { It
is possible that Sethuraman did not know the theory after Nc6 move and made the
most natural move. However better was} (5. Nf3 e4 6. Qb3 $1 Nh6 (6... exf3 7.
Bxf7+ {[%csl Rg8]}) 7. Nfd2 $14 {With a slight edge for White.}) 5... Na5 $1

good drawing chances.} Qxe5 14. Nxe5 Bxe2 15. Kxe2 Bxc3 16. bxc3 Rfe8 17. Nf3
Rxe4+ 18. Kd3 Rc4 $15 {and only Black can be better.}) 13... Bxc3 $1 14. bxc3
b6 {The c3 pawn is weak and Black has absolutely no weaknesses. This is quite a
horrible position to defend against a technical player like Li Chao.} 15. Rac1
Rac8 16. Rfd1 Rc5 17. Qd3 Be6 {Keeping total control on the c4 square.} 18. Qd2
h6 19. Ba6 Qg6 20. Qe2 Bg4 (20... Bc4 21. Bxc4 Nxc4 {is not such a great idea
as the white light squared bishop is not doing anything while the bishop on e6
can be used in the attack.}) 21. Kh1 Qc6 {Threatening b5.} 22. Qd3 f5 $1 {A
strong concrete move that leads to a direct win.} (22... b5 23. Qd6 $1 {and
Black doesn't lose the a6 bishop.}) 23. exf5 b5 $1 24. f6 (24. Qd6 Bxf3 $1

Chinese player, who moves to 3.0/3 along with Anish Giri.} 0-1
