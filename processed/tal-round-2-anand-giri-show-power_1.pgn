Bg2 O-O $5 {Playing a King's Indian, as the next move protects d5. Giri is certainly more known for his Grunfeld.} 5. Nc3 Nc6 $5 {But actually this move almost transposes back to Grunfeld channels.} 6. e3 {Avoiding d5 at all cost! However e3 isn't considered a dangerous set up against the KID.} (6. Nf3 d5 {is the way MVL plays this variation, simply going back to his favorite opening. Of course, there is a chance that Giri would have played 6...d6, but we will never know.}) 6... d6 7. Nge2 e5 8. O-O exd4 9. exd4 Ne7 $5 {An unusual move in a well known position. Most of the time Black plays for a Bf5-Re7 plan, fighting for e4.} 10. Bf4 Nf5 11. Qc1 { Without the possibility of playing Bh6, at least not yet, this move baffles me a bit.} (11. h3 {with the potential idea of g4 might be better to do right away.}) 11... Re8 12. h3 c6 13. g4 Ne7 14. Bh6 d5 15. c5 {It seems foolish to play with an isolated pawn, so Gelfand grabs the space on the queenside.} b6 16. cxb6 (16. b4 {seems more natural to me, though after} a5 17. a3 axb4 18. Bxg7 Kxg7 19. axb4 Rxa1 20. Qxa1 h5 {Black shouldn't have real problems.}) 16... axb6 17. Re1 Bh8 18. Qf4 Nd7 19. Qd2 Nf8 20. Nf4 Ne6 21. Nce2 (21. Nxe6 Bxe6 22. b3 $11) 21... c5 $1 {It looks like this break can't be played, because it loses the d5 pawn, but Giri has decided that the activity is fully worth the pawn. An excellent decision.} 22. dxc5 bxc5 23. Nxd5 (23. Nc3 { was probably better, but it is hard to resist the pawn.} Ra6 $5 {Is a computer idea, with Rd6 coming up soon in certain variations.}) 23... Bb7 {The activity is based on the Benko-style pressure against the b and a pawns and the potential weakness of White's king.} 24. Nec3 Nxd5 25. Nxd5 Bd4 {Of course, having the d4 square for the bishop is also quite juicy.} 26. Nc3 (26. Nf4 $1 { was a better way of trying to hold everything together, though Black's initiative is still strong.}) 26... Bxg2 27. Kxg2 g5 $1 {Exploiting another one of White's problems: now the bishop on h6 is trapped!} 28. h4 (28. Rxe6 Rxe6 29. Bxg5 Qb6 {is very unpleasant for Gelfand.}) 28... gxh4 {The pawn on h4 is actually rather powerful, as it aids in the attack against White's king.} 29. Ne4 Qd5 30. f3 Rad8 $6 {The inclusion of Rd8 and Rd1 in most lines favors White. Kh8 immediately was better.} 31. Rad1 Kh8 32. Bg5 f5 $1 {An excellent move, keeping up the pressure.} 33. Bxd8 Rxd8 {Black has sacrificed a full exchange, but it is not easy to defend the knight on e4.} 34. gxf5 $2 {Losing instantly.} (34. Qh6 $1 fxe4 35. Rxe4 h3+ $1 {Is messy, but should favor Black. }) (34. Ng5 h3+ 35. Kh2 Be5+ 36. Kh1 Qxd2 37. Rxd2 Rxd2 38. Nxe6 Bg3 {looks like a very bad endgame for White, if not just lost.}) 34... Qxf5 35. Kh1 Rg8 { White is defenseless against Black's relatively simple threats.} 36. Rf1 Be5 { Covering h2, White cannot do anything against Qh3 and mate.} 0-1
