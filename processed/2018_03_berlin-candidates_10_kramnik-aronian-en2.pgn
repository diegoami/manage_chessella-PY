1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. d3 a6 {[#] Aronian continues with
an unusual move. Of course, most "normal" is the
symmetrical 5...d6.} 6. Nd5 Nxd5 7. Bxd5 d6 8. Be3 Bxe3 9. fxe3 {[#]
This motif is also taught to beginners: The open f-line offers
attacking opportunities; at the same time, the doubled pawns ensures good control of the
central square d4. Hard to believe at this moment that Kramnik actually has grave plans of attack!} O-O
10. O-O Nb8 11. b4 Nd7 12. Qd2 c6 13. Bb3 a5 14. a3 Nf6 15. h3 h6 16. Rab1 b5
17. Qc3 Bd7 18. Rf2 Qb6 19. Re1 Rfe8 {[#] Now Black is a bit
better. On the kingside, nothing is going on, while White looks passive on the queenside as well.} 20. Nh4 c5 21. Ref1 cxb4 22. Qe1 {[#]} d5 ({
Black had to do something. After} 22... bxa3 $2 {the white attack would
become overpowering:} 23. Rxf6 gxf6 24. Rxf6 Be6) 23. axb4 dxe4 24. bxa5 Rxa5
25. Ng6 {[#] Kramnik remains true to form for this tournament and is fighting for victory.} Be6 26. Nxe5 exd3 27. Rxf6 gxf6 28. Rxf6 d2 29.
Qg3+ Kf8 30. Rf1 Ra7 {[#] The position is completely balanced. But for
Black, defense is extremely difficult and time is running short.} 31. Ng6+ {Kramnik finds the best continuation.} Kg7
32. Nf4+ Kh8 33. Nh5 f6 34. Nxf6 Rf8 35. Qf4 Rh7 36. Qe5 {[#] Both players
have a whole series of more precise options, but it's not merely about moves on the board at this point.} Qc7 $2 {Aronian makes a game ending mistake just before the
time control.} (36... Rg7 $1 37. Bxe6 Rg5 38. Nd5+ Rxe5 39. Rxf8+ Kh7 40. Rf7+
Kg6 41. Rf6+ Kg7 42. Rf7+ {etc. would have led to a drawn conclusion. Hard to
see without enough time on the clock.}) 37. Ne8+ 1-0
