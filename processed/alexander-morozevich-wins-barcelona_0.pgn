There are certainly lines of the Sicilian where ...a5 makes plenty of sense, but it usually involves a Nb3 lacking good squares. Here the knight can easily and happily leap to d4, and now b5 is debilitated making a queenside attack very hard to articulate.} 17. a4 ({With the house vacated, why not continue development with} 17.

Bb5 Ra5 {It is hard to comment properly on this move and the previous one. On the pure side, this is a tremendous blunder, and the engines will gladly sing songs of +5 to any willing to listen. The problem is that the word "blunder" suggests it was inadvertent, and the result of a lapse of judgement or calculation. However, neither is true, and Morozevich knew exactly what he was doing. Preferring not to go down in a bad position with no fight in it, he chose to play arsonist and throw all the gasoline on it to see who burns first.} 21. Nxa5 Ba2+ 22. Kxa2 Qxa5+ 23. Kb3 Qxb5 24.
