        [EventDate "2016.10.01"] {The last round has begun. 11-year-old Praggnanandhaa 
        is up against a 2645 opponent.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 g6 3. Nc3 {Axel realizes 
        that playing non theoretical chess can be good way to confuse the little 
        boy. But the lad likes to play non-theoretical chess â€“ he doesn't like 
        to remember reams of theory like children his own age!} d5 4. Qd2 Bg7 
        5. Bh6 O-O 6. Bxg7 Kxg7 7. O-O-O { Both sides have castled on opposite 
        wings. It can be said that it is easier for White to attack as he already 
        has the hook on g6 and can begin with h4-h5. But let's learn from Praggnanandhaa 
        on the art of how to attack.} c5 $1 { No pretensions! There is no time 
        to waste!} 8. e3 (8. dxc5 Qa5 9. Kb1 Nc6 10. Nxd5 $2 Qxd2 11. Rxd2 Ne4 
        $19) 8... Nc6 9. f3 c4 $5 {In the French Defence, White does well to take 
        dxc5 before going for 0-0-0. Here too it seemed logical that White should 
        have taken on c5. Once c4 is played b5-b4 becomes a natural threat. Bachmann 
        knows that, but how to stop it?} 10. e4 $1 { Understanding the dangers 
        and quickly doing something about it.} b5 $1 { Fearless as always! You 
        don't need to teach Praggu the art of attack!} 11. exd5 Nb4 12. Nxb5 $6 
        {This is going a bit too far.} (12. g4 Nfxd5 13. Nge2 {And the position 
        remains complex.}) 12... Nxa2+ $1 13. Kb1 {Is the knight trapped on a2?} 
        Qxd5 {The knight on b5 is attacked.} 14. Na3 (14. Nc3 {was the lesser 
        evil, but Black is just better after} Nxc3+ 15. Qxc3 Ba6 $17 {The rooks 
        soon double on the b-file and a strong attack is coming up.}) (14. Nc7 
        Qb7 $1 15. Bxc4 (15. Nxa8 c3 16. Qc1 Nxc1 $19) (15. Kxa2 Qxc7 $19) 15... 
        Rb8 16. Nb5 Be6 $1 17. Bxa2 Bxa2+ 18. Kxa2 Qxb5 $19 {with a winning attack.}) 
        14... c3 { It's surprising that Bachmann missed this move. Otherwise why 
        would he allow it?} 15. bxc3 Rb8+ 16. Ka1 Qa5 {And just like that the 
        11-year-old has completely decimated the white king!} 17. Kxa2 Nd5 $1 
        18. Ne2 (18. c4 Nc3+ $19) 18... Be6 {What a resounding victory for Praggu, 
        who simply outclassed his 2645 opponent!} (18... Be6 19. c4 Nb4+ 20. Kb2 
        Nd3+ 21. Ka2 Bxc4+ 22. Ka1 Qxa3# ) 0-1
