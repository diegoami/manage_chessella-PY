Bc5 9. Nf3 (9. Nb3 {is the more common move.}) 9... Ng4 {So how is White
planning to defend his f2 point? Krasenkow thought Bg5-h4 was the best idea
while two other players went Nd1. Mamedyarov has his own ideas when it comes to
having some fun!} 10. b4 $5 {This was immediately played by Shakhriyar, which
meant that he was well prepared.} Bxf2+ {When you have said A you must say B.
Khismatullin takes the pawn but spent 17 minutes on this decision.} 11. Ke2 Bh4
12. h3 Nh6 $6 {The knight gets sidelined on h6.} (12... Nf6 $1 { This was the
most appropriate move. But when you have been surprised over the board it is
not easy to find resources like these.} 13. Nxh4 Nh5 $1 {[%cal Gh5g3,Gd8h4]}
14. Nf3 Ng3+ $15 {Black is better.}) 13. g4 $1 {g5 is coming up next and hence
the bishop has to retreat.} Be7 14. g5 $1 Ng8 {One by one all of black pieces
are pushed back.} 15. Bf4 a6 16. Rd1 h6 17. g6 $1 {With such a lead in
development the position is not at all easy for Black to play. But you can bank
on Khismatullin to find the resources. After all a creative player like him
thrives on such positions.} f5 $1 18. Ne5 $1 {Blow for blow! Nf7 fork is
threatened.} Qc7 19. Bh2 (19. Ke3 $6 Bg5 $1 $17) 19... Nf6 $1 $17 {Black pieces
are coming out once again and White is under pressure to prove his
compensation.} 20. Nf7 Qxc4+ 21. Ke1 Qc8 22. Bg2 (22. Nxh8 Bxe4 $17) 22... Nxe4

on c3 is not taken then Qe4+ is a dangerous threat.} 27. Qxc3 (27. Rxc3 Qxh4+

{Black is an exchange down but has a bunch of pawns and the exposed position of
the white king gives him an excellent position.} 29. Qxg7 O-O-O $15) 27. Nf7
Kf8 28. Rxc3 Nc6 {Black is three pawns up but little does Shakhriyar care about
things like that. He has the dark squared bishop and tries to complicate the
play.} 29. Bg3 Qe8 30. Bd6+ Kg8 31. Qd2 {This is the problem in opposite
coloured bishop endgames. No matter how many pawns you are up, until you lose
control on the other square complex these pawns are often blockaded and the
extra material is not felt.} Ne7 32. Nxh6+ $1 gxh6 33. Qxh6 Qxg6 34. Rg3 $1 Kf7
35. Rxg6 Nxg6 36. Qh7+ Kf6 37. h4 Nf8 38. Be7+ {Objectively the game was not
very high on quality. But what about the entertainment quotient? Both players
try to stir up the complications to the maximum extent! In the end it was
Mamedyarov who emerged victorious and in this tournament he has already played
some excellent games.} 1-0
