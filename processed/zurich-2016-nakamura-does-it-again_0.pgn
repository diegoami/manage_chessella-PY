1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 O-O 6. e3 Nbd7 7. c5 {At some
point people wanted to call this the Aronian variations, as Levon had quite a
bit of success with it.} c6 8. h3 b6 9. b4 a5 10. a3 h6 11. Bd3 Ba6 12. O-O
Bxd3 13. Qxd3 Qc8 14. Rfc1 Qb7 15. Rab1 axb4 16. axb4 Rfc8 17. Nd2 Bd8 18. Nb3
Bc7 19. Bxc7 Qxc7 20. Ra1 Qb7 21. b5 $2 {This is where thing start going wrong
for Aronian. Thinking about it I'm not entirely sure what the Armenian missed
as the lines are pretty straight forward.} Rxa1 22. Rxa1 bxc5 23. Na5 Qa8 24.
Nb3 (24. bxc6 Rxc6 {does not recover the pawn, and obviously taking with the
knight on c6 is impossible due to the pin down the a-file.}) 24... Qb7 25. Na5
Qa8 26. Nb3 Qb8 {Black is after all up a pawn, and even though conversion
should be technically difficult it is only Black that is playing for a win now.
} 27. dxc5 cxb5 28. Qd4 (28. Qxb5 Qxb5 29. Nxb5 Nxc5 30. Rc1 Nfd7 31. Nd6 Rc7
32. Nxc5 Rxc5 33. Ra1 {was the best practical chance: here even though Black is
a solid pawn ahead he has to contend with some immediate threats, such as Ra8+
or Ra7.}) 28... b4 29. Na4 Qb5 30. Qb2 Ne4 31. f3 Nexc5 32. Naxc5 Nxc5 { Now it
is two pawns for Hikaru, and there is very little to show for it.} 33. Rc1 Rc7
34. Qe5 Qb6 35. f4 (35. Qd4 Nd7 36. Rxc7 Qxc7 37. Qxb4 {would have required
Nakamura to show some endgame technique as the pawn advantage is reduced to
only one.}) 35... Na6 36. Ra1 Rc3 37. Nd4 Nc7 38. Rb1 f6 39. Qh5 Rxe3 {White is
down too much material and his knight on d4 is hanging.} 0-1
