        might not be 100% sound, but it is quite interesting. It is one of the 
        favourites of Simon Williams!} 9. Nxg5 Rg8 10. d4 h6 11. Nf3 Bxh3 { The 
        pawn has been recovered, but now White could have got a very nice edge 
        with d4-d5. Instead he decided to exchange the queens and this ended with 
        equality.} 12. dxe5 $6 (12. d5 $1 {It seems counter-intuitive to close 
        the center when your opponent is attacking your king. But here the attack 
        is not so scary and White has a clear edge after} Ne7 13. b4 $1 b6 14.

        opening and has an excellent position â€“ his idea of scaring his opponent 
        worked out very well. Later on McShane tried to be too ambitious and ended 
        up in a bad position, giving Pert the lead.} 14. Nbd2 Bg4 15. Nh4 Nh5
