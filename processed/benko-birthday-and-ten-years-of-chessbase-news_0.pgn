So White needs to get the initial position of the study with Black to move. But while losing the tempo the white king needs to be very careful: it may not move to a white square, except c2, because otherwise the black bishop on g8 can give check and the queen takes the rook on b8; the white king also must not move to the squares c1, d2 or e3, otherwise the black bishop on h6 can check and the queen takes the rook on h5.} 1.
