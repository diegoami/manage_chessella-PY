originality from both players if White goes down a particular route.} ({
In a previous encounter with one of the other players in my section, I chose}

line.} 6. e4 (6. e3 a6 7. a4 b4 {should also be approximately equal, and was
chosen by the Black player of the main game when he had the White pieces.} 8.

fine although I later went on to lose in Ider,B-Fernandez,D Porto 2015}) 5. a4

last note Black doesn't even have any structural problems.} Qxf6 6. c3 Qb6 7.

a vast amount of compensation, though finishing the job is always still
difficult.}) (6... g6 $14 {does nothing about the structural deficiencies, but
Black should survive the opening.}) 7. e4 Nbd7 $6 {For Keith Arkell, allowing
further structural problems would feel worse than death itself, so he opts to
prevent e5 rather than getting on with castling immediately.} 8. Be2 $6 {
This is slightly slack.} (8. Bb5 $1 h6 9. Bd2 $16 {isn't something that
usually happens within 10 moves: White will get e5, possibly prefaced with Qe2
and/or castling.}) 8... h6 9. Be3 g6 10. O-O Bg7 11. Nxa4 (11. Rxa4 {was maybe
marginally better, keeping open the option of Qd2 and Rfa1.}) 11... Qc7 12. Nd2

survived the worst.} 13. Nc3 Nb6 (13... a5 $1 $14 {somehow gives Black
reasonable Benko-type counterplay, even without the odd tempo here and there.})

then either ...Ba6 or ...Bd7 and ...Rfb8.}) 15. Kh1 e6 16. dxe6 fxe6 (16...

only slightly worse.}) 20. Qe2 d5 $2 {Now Black gets bound up in a truly
awful-looking structure.} (20... Rab8 21. e5 dxe5 22. fxe5 Nd7 23. Bxb7 Qxb7

to do, trying to win a position with the centre as clarified as possible.})

getting worried about ...d4, which would look a bit too much like counterplay
to most players.} (24. c3 {is also possible, but unnecessary, and Black may
get the chance to sacrifice an exchange with} h5 25. Bf3 Rf8 {and then just
leaving it on f5.}) 24... d4 25. Bd2 Nf8 (25... Kh7 26. Bh5 Nf8 27. Bf3 $16 {

give up g6.} 30. Bxf8 Rxf8 31. Qxg6 Qxc2 32. Qxe6+ Kh8 $16 {and there is a bit
of counterplay.}) 30. Bd6 Qf7 31. Nc5 $1 $18 {The trap slams shut. The rest of
