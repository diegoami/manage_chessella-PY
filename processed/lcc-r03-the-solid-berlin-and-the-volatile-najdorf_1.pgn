His pawns on e5 and f5 are extremely strong and his bishop works perfectly. It might not be a very huge advantage, but it's very easy to play as White and Magnus's defensive task is not so easy.} Rde8 26. Kf3 $6 {A pretty bad oversight by Anand who loses all his advantage.} (26. Rxh8 Rxh8 27. Kf3 Nc6 {Trying to play like in the game doesn't work, as now the rook is on h8 and not on e8.} 28. Rd1 $1 $16) 26... Rxh1 $1 27. Rxh1 Nc6 { Suddenly the e5 pawn is hanging. Black is already pretty fine.} 28. Re1 g5 $1 { Keeping the king out of the f4 square.} 29. a4 a6 30. Kg2 Kc8 31. Kf2 b6 32. Kf3 Kd7 33. Kf2 Kc8 {Both of the players were sort of repeating moves and maybe a draw would have been agreed immediately if Anand would not have made the following mistake.} 34. Re3 $2 {The rook move to e3 is an embarrassingly poor move, as Anand pointed out in the press conference. There is no point to it and the rook simply comes under attack after Na5-c4.} Na5 $1 35. Re1 Nc4 { The tables have turned. Black is the one in the driver's seat and his next task is to create a passed pawn on the queenside.} 36. Kf3 Kd7 37. Kg2 a5 ( 37... c6 {It could have been more accurate to start with c6, although what Carlsen played in the game is also fine.}) 38. Kf2 c6 39.
