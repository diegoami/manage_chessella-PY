{A heroic defense up to this point by the Cuban WFM, which was surely received
in not such cordial terms by the Peruvian player. After a tough and long game,
Yaniela missed a beautiful drawing mechanism and landed instead in an immediate
lost position.} 61... e3 $2 {was played thinking that} (61... Rb3+ { shouldn't
work due to} 62. Kf2 Rb2+ 63. Ke3 Rb3+ 64. Kd2 Rb2+ {and} 65. Kc3 { but here
Black has} Rxb7 $1 66. Bxb7 g3 $19 {Oups! Therefore, White has to accept the
inevitable - a draw by perpetual.}) 62. Nd7+ Ke7 63. b8=Q 1-0
