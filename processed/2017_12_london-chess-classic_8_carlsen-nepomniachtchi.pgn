1. Nf3 ({After 4...Nc6 in today's game, we get a position that is similar to} 1.
d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nc3 Nf6 {but there is actually a big
difference here, as the knight is more aggressively positioned on c3, than one
would be on f3. One reason is that} 5. Bf4 Nc6 6. e3 a6 {can be met with} 7.
Be2 $5 ({rather than} 7. Nf3 {when} Bg4 {is comfortable for Black.})) 1... c5
2. c3 {At such a high level, this move has mostly been played in blitz games.
It is a I'm-inviting-you-to-a-Slav-with-opposite-colours-move that is a tricky
move against those who don't have the Slav on their repertoire with either
White or Black. Nepomniachtchi hasn't played the Slav for almost a decade, so
it makes a lot of sense for Carlsen to play like this.} d5 {This move is the
equivalent of "calling" in poker. Saying: -So, you want to play the Slav a
tempo up? Go ahead, please.} ({The other respectable continuation is} 2... Nf6
3. d4 e6 {a set-up that Carlsen had a close encounter with only a short time
ago:} 4. Bg5 d5 5. e3 h6 6. Bh4 Nc6 7. Nbd2 a6 8. Bd3 Be7 9. O-O Nd7 10. Bxe7
Nxe7 11. Ne5 cxd4 12. exd4 Nxe5 13. dxe5 Bd7 14. Re1 Rc8 15. Nf3 {with a
promising position for White, in Carlsen,M (2825)-Xiong,J (2630) chess.com IoM
Masters 2017.}) 3. d4 cxd4 {And Black calls again, forcing White to enter an
exchange Slav, where he is unable to play the most critical lines (due to the
early development of the knight to f3).} 4. cxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bf4 Nh5 $5 {
Black chooses a rather rare line, probably wanting to avoid a theoretical
battle after} (6... Bf5) ({or} 6... a6) 7. Bd2 Nf6 8. e3 {I often complain
that Bc1-d2 and Bc8-d7 are sad excuses for moves, but here White got it for
free and it does free the c1-square for the rook.} e6 ({Ideally, Black would
like to play} 8... Bf5 {but after} 9. Ne5 $1 {Black has to deal with a
number of annoying ideas, of which g2-g4 is only one.}) 9. Bd3 $1 {If White is
to gain a promising game, then there is no way around playing e3-e4.} (9. Bb5
Bd7 10. O-O Bd6 {and there is no way to make headway on the queenside.}) 9...
Bd6 10. e4 dxe4 11. Nxe4 Be7 {Although this leads to a standard set-up for
Black, it was somewhat surprising to me, as it seems that White has gained a
tempo in the process (Bd2).} ({Karpov was one of the greatest handlers of this
structure and I believe that he might have chosen} 11... Nxe4 12. Bxe4 Ne7 $5
13. O-O O-O {, instead.} {After} 14. Qc2 (14. Bxh7+ $2 Kxh7 15. Ng5+ Kg6 16.
Qg4 f5) (14. Ne5 h6 15. Re1 {might be a better set-up aiming to lift the rook
to the third rank.}) 14... h6 15. Ne5 Rb8 {, followed by b5 and Bb7, or just
Bd7, Black is doing fine.}) 12. O-O O-O 13. Qc2 {I would not place my queen
here, but Magnus has a 300 ELO-point margin to me, so I guess it is good.
Possibly he wanted to force Black to some kind of concession on the kingside.}
(13. Qe2 {is the natural place for the queen in this structure (as I see it).})
13... h6 ({With the bishop on e7 Black ususally plays} 13... g6 {If White
continues like in the game with} 14. Rad1 Bd7 15. a3 Rc8 16. Nc3 a6 {then it
seems to me that it is harder for White to create threats against Black's king.
} (16... Nd5)) (13... Nxe4 14. Bxe4 f5 $2 (14... g6 15. Bh6 Re8 16. Rad1) 15.
Bxc6 bxc6 16. Rfe1 $16) 14. Rad1 Bd7 (14... Nxd4 15. Nxd4 Qxd4 16. Bc3 Qb6 17.
Nxf6+ Bxf6 18. Bxf6 gxf6 19. Qd2 Kg7 20. Bb1 {leaves White with a nasty
initiative on the diagonal.}) 15. a3 Rc8 {Black has no complaints after the
opening. The queen seems to be misplaced on c2.} 16. Nc3 $1 a6 {Black is
obviously happy with his position and chooses to play an ambitious plan,
involving b7-b5-b4. Other possibilities were} (16... Nd5) (16... Na5) ({
and my favourite (Karpov-inspired) plan:} 16... Bd6 {, intending Ne7 and Bc6.})
17. Qc1 $5 {Magnus finds a way to make the queens position count for something.
Perhaps he had the whole set-up planned and this is indeed the most
challenging idea against h7-h6!?? It seems far fetched.} Re8 18. Rfe1 Bf8 19.
Bf4 {White has managed to get coordinated and it is time for Black to act
before White starts attacking.} b5 $1 20. Qd2 b4 21. axb4 Nxb4 22. Ne5 $1 ({
Most mortals would hang on to the bishop with} 22. Bb1 {but Carlsen correctly
assesses that it is the dark squares that matter most in the attack.} Nbd5 23.
Ne5 Bb5 {and Black is more than comfortable.}) 22... Nxd3 23. Qxd3 a5 {This is
either a very confident move or a wish to play with fire. White can continue
to build up on the kingside as long as he hasn't lost all control of d5, so
Black's simplest defence is to challenge that:} (23... Bb5 $5 24. Nxb5 (24. Qf3
Bc4 $1) 24... axb5 25. Qxb5 Nd5 {holds no danger for Black. The knight on d5
is wonderful, while White's extra pawn on b2, is a target.}) 24. Qf3 $1 {
Suddenly Black is faced with a series of more serious threats. Both Bf4-g3-h4
and h4 followed by Bg5 can become annoying. The biggest tactical weakness in
Black's position is the pawn on f7, so the best defence probably involves
protecting that pawn once more...} Bb4 $2 {This leaves the king far too naked.}
(24... Qe7 $1 {, is the right move, in order to be able to move the knigt from
f6 without inviting a catastrophe on f7:} 25. Nxd7 Nxd7 (25... Qxd7 $5 26. Bxh6
a4 {, followed by Nd5, leads to a position that is very hard for White to win 
(since all the pawns are on the "wrong colour").}) 26. d5 Nc5 {is balanced.})
25. Re3 ({Carlsen's move is not bad at all, but possibly stronger was} 25. Bxh6
$1 {It is quite untypical for such a strong player to miss such a shot (so
perhaps he didn't). The point is that after} Bxc3 26. bxc3 gxh6 27. Qg3+ {
Black cannot go to f8:} Kh7 (27... Kf8 $2 28. Rd3 $1 Bc6 (28... Ke7 29. Qg7 Rf8
30. d5 $1) 29. Qf4 Ke7 30. c4 {and Black has no defence against d4-d5.}) 28.
Nxf7 Qe7 29. Qd3+ Kg7 (29... Kg8 30. Qg6+) 30. Ne5 {and Black has no way to
avoid giving back material. For instance} Rf8 31. Qg6+ Kh8 32. Qxh6+ Qh7 {
and the best way to take the exchange is} 33. Ng6+ Kg8 34. Qg5 Qh5 35. Qxh5
Nxh5 36. Nxf8 Kxf8 {, followed by} 37. d5 $1 {when Black will not be able to
create enough counterplay with the a-pawn. Perhaps Carlsen saw some of this
and decided that he didin't like the look of that a-pawn and that it was just
as good to just build.}) 25... Bxc3 26. bxc3 {This positional transformation
favours White. Now, not only are the threats on the kingside, but also c4/d5
becomes a factor.} Ba4 $1 {Usually I don't watch the comments or the inteviews
with the players, but this time I was sent a short piece where Carlsen talked
about the game. He searching to explaing his feeling about the game he said:
"I failed to predict a single of his moves", which is a strong indication that
he was not his normal self today. Especially the next few moves are puzzling.}
27. Ra1 $6 {This allows Black to get the bishop back in the defence.} ({
Much stronger was} 27. Rc1 $1 {,when the bishop is rather weird on a4, whereas}
Qxd4 {, doesn't work due to} (27... Rf8 $1 28. Rd3 Nd5 29. c4 $1 (29. Bd2 f6
30. Ng6 Re8 {is not so clear.}) 29... f6 30. Ng4 Nxf4 31. Qxf4 {and the
central pawns, combined with Black's awkward pawn structure, leaves White with
an advantage.}) 28. Ra1 $1 Qb6 29. Bxh6 $1 {with disastrous concequences for
Black.}) 27... Bc2 $1 28. h3 $5 {Many are reluctant to play such a move since
the rook might go there later. However, giving the king some air, means that
White is more free to use the rook on a1, as there are no more back rank mates.
} Bf5 $2 ({The most tenacious defence could have led to serious complications:
} 28... Nd5 $5 29. Bxh6 Qe7 $1 (29... Bg6 30. c4 Nxe3 31. Bxe3 Bf5 32. c5 Qd5
33. Qh5 Re7 34. Rxa5 f6 35. Ng6 Bxg6 36. Qxg6 Ra8 {is the kind of line that
the engines give as "=", but where it is far easier to play the white side.}) (
29... f6 30. Bxg7 fxe5 31. Bxe5 $40) 30. Bxg7 (30. Qg3 f6 31. Re2 Rxc3 32. Nf3
Qc7 33. Bd2 Qxg3 34. fxg3 Rc6 35. Rxa5 {is a position where White's extra pawn
doesn't count for much.}) 30... Kxg7 31. Qg4+ Bg6 (31... Kh6 32. Rf3 Bg6 $1 33.

it is not clear that White has a way forward.}) (28... Rf8 29. Rc1) 29. g4 $1 {
There were probably a few who thought that Magnus would win at this stage and
would have thought so too.} Bh7 30. c4 $6 ({It is truly strange that Carlsen
didn't play} 30. g5 Nd5 31. Nxf7 $1 {Suffice to say, that White gets a huge
attack. After} Qb6 32. Nd6 Nxe3 $1 (32... Rf8 33. Nxc8) 33. Qxe3 h5 34. c4 {
White is dominating. It is quite out of character for Carlsen to miss
something like this. It seems like he wasn't able to think clearly today.})
30... Nd7 {Although this doesn't solve all of Black's problems, it is clearly
an improvement to be able to exhange the menace on e5.} 31. Nc6 $2 (31. c5 $1
Nxe5 32. Bxe5 f6 33. Bd6 Ra8 34. Qc6 {would have kept a rather large advantage
for White.}) 31... Qf6 32. Nxa5 Nb6 {Now White's pieces are all in the wrong
places. If only one could play c5 and Na5-c4-d6...} 33. c5 $2 Rxc5 $1 {Missing
such a move is truly demoralizing.} 34. dxc5 $2 {Here Carlsen seems to lose
his will to fight. Now one mistake follows another.} (34. Be5 Qxf3 35. Rxf3 Rc2
{is very unpleasant for White, but was nethertheless necessary.}) 34... Qxa1+
35. Kh2 Qxa5 36. Qc6 $2 (36. cxb6 Qxb6 {is no fun for White, but not quite
lost yet.}) 36... Qa4 {Forking the queen and the bishop and the game is over.}
37. Qxa4 Nxa4 38. c6 Nb6 39. c7 f6 40. Rb3 Nc8 {A good day for Nepomniachtchi.
He was lucky to escape and win, but luck usually comes to those who deserve it.
