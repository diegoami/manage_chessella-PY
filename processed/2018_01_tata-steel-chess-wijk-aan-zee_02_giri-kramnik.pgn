1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 Bb4 3. Qb3 {I was intrigued by this opening, and looked around
it a bit, finding that it is indeed played reasonably often by really top
players, but probably should not promise anything, at least on a cursory
investigation.} Ba5 (3... a5 {is a stereotypical 'Bogo' way to play, and after}
4. a3 Bxc3 5. Qxc3 Nf6 6. b3 O-O 7. Bb2 d6 8. e3 e5 9. d4 Nc6 $11 {Black was
fine in Aronian,L-Riazantsev,A Sharjah 2017}) 4. Nf3 c5 (4... Nf6 {was played
in an old Conquest-Rozentalis game, but doubtless Giri had something else
quite inventive up his sleeve, for instance} 5. g4 $5 $13) 5. d4 Nf6 6. dxc5 $5
{Not holding back, Giri makes a double-edged decision that might score
worse on the engine pane, but is nearly certain to get him the bishop pair and
hence an imbalanced position.} (6. e3 {might well be more solid, and Black
needs to be careful that he does not transpose to an awkward Nimzo. This can
be acheived with} cxd4 $6 7. exd4 d5 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. Bd3 $14 {and for this
reason Black should prefer something like 6...d6.}) 6... Na6 7. Be3 Ne4 8. g3
Naxc5 9. Qc2 Bxc3+ (9... Nxc3 10. bxc3 b6 11. Bg2 {is a hard thing for a human
to play as Black, with the backward d-pawn and the wayward bishop on a5.}) 10.
bxc3 b6 11. Bg2 Bb7 12. O-O O-O 13. Rfd1 Qe7 {Now we have more or less the
position that White signed up for on move 6. A simplistic evaluation would be
'equal', a better one would be 'equal for kids or blitz players, better for
Black from 1800 to 2600 in classical, and messy above that!'} 14. a4 {One
problem Black has is that he cannot block the a5-push.} d6 (14... f5 15. a5 e5
16. axb6 axb6 {might have been preferable for Black, who intends ...f4 soon-
the plan is very easy to grasp.}) 15. a5 f5 16. axb6 axb6 17. Nd4 Nf6 18. Bxb7
Nxb7 19. Rxa8 Rxa8 20. Nb5 Rc8 $6 {Leaving the a-file, which White eventually
exploits, and he could in fact have done so a bit faster.} (20... Nd7 $1 {
is sensible, heading for c5 with one knight and either a5 or e5 with the other,
and keeping the Nimzo-typical ...Rc8 in reserve. White wins a pawn with} 21.
Nxd6 Nxd6 22. Qd3 Ne5 23. Qxd6 Qxd6 24. Rxd6 Nxc4 25. Rxe6 {but after} Rc8 $3 {
his pieces are so badly tangled that he must give it back to get out.} 26. Re7

Rxc4 $6 (22... Qd7 $5 23. Bxf6 gxf6 $132 {is quite a random defensive attempt,
but it seems okay.}) (22... dxc4 23. Qa7 $16) 23. Qa8+ Kf7 24. Ra1 Na5 25. Qb8
Rc6 26. Nd4 Rxc3 $2 (26... Rd6 $1 {leaves Black facing a string of tactical
problems, but his pieces aren't as poorly linked as in the game.} 27. Bf4 (27.

Qxb6 Nc4 29. Qb8 Qe8 $11) 27. Qxb6 {Now Black should be lost, which seemingly
is only discovered by playing down lines with the engine rather than just
letting it run.} Nc4 28. Qb8 Nd7 {The final mistake, getting the rook
trivially trapped.} (28... Ra3 29. Rb1 Kg6 {is the engine attempt, and now
White may have nothing better than an almost-definitely-winning ending with}
