Rd8 {Wei Yi resigned the game at this point seeing that his bishop is attacked,
and if he moves it b6 followed by b7-b8 is threatened. After b6 he cannot play
Bxb6, as then Rd6+ will pick up the piece. Yet, here Black has a miraculous
defence which was overlooked by the Chinese grandmaster.} -- (53... Bb6 $3 {
Can you believe this! This is the only way in which Black can fight on,
although most probably even this is objectively lost. But it is not so easy to
prove it.} 54. Rd6+ Ke7 55. Rd2 (55. Rxb6 $2 b3 $1 {The a and c-files are
useless as a1 and c1 will be covered after b2. And there are no other squares
available.} 56. Rb7+ Ke8 57. Rb8+ Ke7 $11) 55... Ke6 56. Kg2 {Slowly White
should win this as he will activate his king and break the fortress. However,
this sequence starting with Bb6 was definitely worth trying over the board by
Wei Yi.}) (53... Be3 $2 54. b6 $1 Bxb6 (54... b3 55. b7 b2 56. b8=Q $18) 55.
