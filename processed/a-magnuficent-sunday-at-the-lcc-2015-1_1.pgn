Bb2 { [%emt 0:00:35]} Rd8 {[%emt 0:00:36] Both the players reached this point quite quickly. After that Aronian sank into deep thought. Black has stopped 0-0-0. Let us try to understand the various imbalances in the position. It somehow resembles the Berlin because Black's pawn majority on the queenside doesn't seem so potent. White on the kingside has a working majority although the pawns are doubled. Meanwhile Black's development is quite smooth. He can move his bishop to e6/f5 and connect the rooks. White has to figure out where he would like to place his king. Let's see how the game proceeds.} 12. h4 $5 { [%emt 0:06:13] Planning to exchange the light squared bishops. Once the bishops are exchanged the king would feel safer on e2.} g6 {[%emt 0:04:23]} 13. Bh3 $6 {[%emt 0:05:38] This move seems logically fine but it doesn't help White to get an advantage.

Ke2 {[%emt 0:00:42]} Rb8 {[%emt 0:03:16] Black plans to break on the queenside with b5. If White takes it straightens out the pawn structure and if he doesn't then bxc4 would give the black rook a lot of activity.} 18.
