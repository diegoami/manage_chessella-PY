1. e4 e6 {It's unusual to see Nakamura play a French...} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 { Most
French players will tell you that if they knew that White will play 3. e5 for
sure, they would play the French all day every day!} c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6.
a3 Nh6 7. b4 {I've never beelieved in the lines that involve Bxh6 against the
French, even though the great advance French expert, Grischuk, recently used it
against Caruana. (In a blitz game, in which he lost!). } cxd4 8. Bxh6 gxh6 9.
cxd4 Bd7 10. Ra2 Rg8 11. h3 (11. g3 {Grischuk-Caruana, 2014 Dubai Blitz WCH})
11... h5 12. g3 h4 13. g4 Be7 14. Be2 f6 {Typical French stuff. Black has the
pair of bishops and is fighting to break open the center.} 15. b5 Nd8 {Making
way for f7. The knight has plenty of potential from there.} (15... Na5 $5)
(15... Nxd4 16. Qxd4 Qxd4 17. Nxd4 fxe5 { is a bit too optimistic, but not
suicidal.}) 16. Qd3 Rg7 17. Nc3 Nf7 18. O-O $6 {Brave, but foolish. Why castle
into it?} (18. exf6 Bxf6 19. Qe3 $15) 18... h5 (18... fxe5 19. Nxe5 Nxe5 20.
dxe5 Rc8 $17 {was probably stronger, leaving h5 for a later moment while
finishing the development of the queenside. We will see soon how this is
important.}) 19. Na4 Qd8 20. exf6 Bxf6 21. Nc5 hxg4 22. hxg4 b6 (22... Rxg4+
23. Kh1 {leaves Black's position a tad awkward as White does have a lot of
threats here.}) 23. Nxd7 Qxd7 24. Kh1 Rc8 25. Rc2 Rxc2 26. Qxc2 Nd6 27. Ne5
Bxe5 28. dxe5 Ne4 29. Kg2 Nc5 30. Rh1 Qe7 31. Qc1 Rh7 32. Qe3 Qg7 33. Rc1 Qf8
{It seems that White has managed to stabilize his position.} 34. a4 (34. f3
$11) 34... Rf7 35. f3 Rf4 36. Rxc5 $4 {This move is hard to understand. Perhaps
Shirov thought he had adequare counterplay with his passed pawns?} bxc5 37. a5
h3+ (37... Rb4 {is also totally winning... Black is just up the exchange.}) 38.
Kg3 $2 h2 39. Kxh2 Qh6+ 40. Kg2 Rxg4+ { costs White a queen.} 0-1
