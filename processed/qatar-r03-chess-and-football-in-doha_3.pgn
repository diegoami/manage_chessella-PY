Diagram [#] Gradually from the 25th move onwards Daniele Vocaturo outplayed his
world class opponent. 40 moves have been completed so both players received an
extra 30 minutes. Three pawns up with ample of time should be good enough to
win for a 2597 player one would think. However, to finish off guys like Kramnik
is not as easy as you think.} 41. Nc5 {While this move is completely fine, it
does give up the control of the d2 square. Maybe much more safe was to bring
back the rook to the defence.} (41. Rc6 Ne5 42. Rc1 Rxc1 43. Nxc1 Nc4 44. Rb3
Rd2+ 45. Nge2 gxf3+ 46. Kxf3 $18 {Everything looks secured and White can look
forward to pushing his three extra pawns.}) 41... h5 42. e5 (42. f4 R1d2+ 43.
Rxd2 Rxd2+ 44. Kh1 $18 {should be clearly winning for White as well. It doesn't
look great to lock your king on h1 but then how is Black going to get his
knight in to the game?}) 42... Nd5 43. Kf2 (43. Ra2 $18 { [%cal Ga2a7] With the
idea of Ra7 was still pretty good for White. But when you have to resort to
sharp lines in a position where you are three pawns up it usually means that
things have gone wrong already.}) 43... Ra8 $1 {You can bank on Kramnik to find
the best moves that pose maximum problems to his opponent.} 44. Ra6 {By now
Vocaturo must have become quite nervous. Seeing all the lines where Black is
getting loads of counterplay and yet maintaining your cool is not at all easy.}
(44. fxg4 hxg4 45. Ra6 {was better than what happened in the game but things
are not at all clear anymore.}) 44... Rxa6 45. Nxa6 Nxe5 46. Nc5 Nc4 47. Re2
Nce3 {Rf1 is a mate in one!} 48. Re1 Rd2+ 49. Re2 Rd1 50. Re1 Rd2+ 51. Re2 {A
miraculous escape for Kramnik. Before the game started Vocaturo would have
happily taken the draw, but after what happened this was not a great result for
the Italian.} 1/2-1/2
