1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 ({No one has been as persistent about playing} 2... g6 {
as Radjabov, at such a high level, but lately he has turned to more classical
openings. It is a mature decision. The dark squared openings are, generally
speaking, more powerful when your opponent has to spend some time preparing
against classical alternatives.}) 3. Nf3 b6 {This is already a small surprise
as Radjabov usually heads for a QGD-set-up.} 4. g3 Bb7 ({The most popular
continuation (and the main reason why so many try to avoid this opening) is} 
4... Ba6 5. b3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Be7 7. Nc3 d5 8. cxd5 exd5 9. Bg2 O-O 10. O-O Re8 {
as in, for instance, Nakamura,H (2785)-Karjakin,S (2780) GCT Rapid Paris 2017.
b2-b3 makes it harder for White to put the rook on c1 without being harrassed,
which is the main reason Black is happy to (soon) lose a tempo with Bc8-a6-b7.
This would not be so much trouble for White if only the bishop could go to b2,
and there we have the reason for the other tempo-loss: Bf8-b4-e7.}) 5. Bg2 Be7
6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Ne4 8. Bd2 {This is a well trafficked crossroad for Black.}
Nxd2 (8... Bf6 {is usually met with} 9. Rc1 (9. Be1 {is a promising
alternative:} c5 10. Qc2 $5) 9... Nxd2 10. Qxd2 d6 {with similar play to the
game.}) (8... f5 9. Ne5 Nxc3 10. Bxc3 Bxg2 11. Kxg2 Bf6 12. Qd3 d5 13. Rfd1 $14
{L'Ami,E (2596)-Tiviakov,S (2677) Wijk aan Zee 2012.}) (8... d5 {is the
traditional way, but after} 9. cxd5 exd5 10. Rc1 {White gets the kind of
position that the 4...Ba6-line (see above) is aimed at avoiding.}) 9. Qxd2 d6
10. Rad1 {I suspect there to be a deep reason why Gelfand prefers this move to
10.e4, but I cannot find it. Apart from e4/d5, it is hard to see a good plan
for White.} ({Beliavsky has experienced the position after} 10. e4 {from both
sides:} Nd7 11. Rfe1 a6 12. Qe2 (12. Rad1 b5 13. cxb5 axb5 14. a3 c6 15. d5 e5
16. dxc6 Bxc6 17. Nd5 {led to equality, in Huebner,R (2570)-Beliavsky,A (2605)
17th Puhajarve Rapid 2016.}) 12... c5 13. d5 e5 14. h4 $1 {I quite like
Beliavsky's plan here.} Rb8 15. a4 Nf6 16. Bh3 {White has played economically
and - compared to our game - has avoided both b3 and Rad1 (which are two moves
that seem less than optimal).} g6 17. Kg2 Kg7 18. Rh1 h5 {This set-up doesn't
turn out well for Black, so an improvement should be sought for around here.}
19. Ng5 Bc8 {A terrible concession for Black. White gets rid of his least
wanted minor piece and keeps a free hand on the kingside, while Black has no
real counterplay.} 20. Bxc8 Qxc8 21. Raf1 (21. f3 $1 Ne8 22. Nh3 Nc7 23. Nf2
$14 {looks more flexible.} b5 24. axb5 axb5 25. cxb5) 21... Rb7 22. f3 Ne8 23.
Rf2 (23. Nh3 Nc7) 23... Bxg5 24. hxg5 f6 {and Black had equalized although
White eventually won, in Beliavsky,A (2605)-Livaic,L (2435) 26th TCh-SLO 2016.}
) 10... Nd7 11. Rfe1 c5 {This is the only central break that comes into
consideration here.} (11... e5 $2 12. Nxe5 $1) (11... d5 $6 12. cxd5 exd5 13.
Qc2 {and White is perfectly coordinated to make life miserable for Black. Next,
after} Re8 14. e4 dxe4 15. Nxe4 {is even worse than it at first seems, for
Black. For instance} Nf6 16. Nxf6+ Bxf6 17. Rxe8+ Qxe8 18. Qxc7 {loses a pawn.}
) 12. e4 {White will soon have to play d4-d5, or run out of constructive moves.
e4 will help in all the structures that might possibly arise then.} a6 13. d5
e5 $1 {So, even though it started as a light-squared opening (Queen's Indian)
Radjabov has managed to get a typical dark-squared-opening pawn structure (Old
Benoni style). He is back on his home turf. It does not matter very much that
Black has the bishop pair here, but Be7 is quite well placed as it keeps Nf3
from accessing h4, from where it would make f5 very hard to achieve. Black is
not to happy about the placement of Bb7, which would be better placed on the
c8-h3 diagonal, but the rook is equally off track on e1.} 14. b3 {If White is
going to stop Black from playing b6-b5, then I see no reason not to play a2-a4
immediately.} (14. a4 $1) (14. Rf1 b5) 14... g6 $1 {Black has two possible
breaks: b6-b5 and f7-f5. The latter is no good unless Black can answer exf5
with gxf5. Ergo: Black's last move.} (14... f5 $4 15. exf5 Rxf5 16. Qe2 {
, followed by Bh3 and Black is completely lost. Radjabov spends a few moves
preparing f5 before taking the leap.}) 15. Rf1 (15. h4 $5 {is a logical move
here. The point is that the exchange of the h-pawns would benefit White
somewhat as f7-f5 would leave the Black king much more exposed than is the
case in the game.} h5 $6 16. a3 {and again it becomes hard for Black to play
f7-f5:} f5 $2 17. Qh6 $18) 15... Bc8 16. Ne1 {Gelfand is following a
traditional script on how to treat such a position. By re-routing the knight
to d3, White finds coordination and is prepared to meet f5 with f4 (aiming for
the e6-square).} Rb8 (16... b5 {After} 17. cxb5 axb5 18. Nxb5 Ba6 19. a4 Bxb5
20. axb5 Qb6 21. Qd3 Ra5 22. Nf3 Qxb5 23. Qxb5 Rxb5 24. Nd2 Nb6 25. h4 {
White seems to hold the balance comfortably. The engine comes up with the
surprising} g5 $1 26. h5 (26. hxg5 Bxg5 27. f4 (27. Nc4 Nxc4 28. bxc4 Rb4 $15))
26... g4 $1 27. Rfe1 Rb4 28. Bf1 f5 {when Black keeps some initiative. So,
perhaps this is the more challenging move.}) 17. a4 f5 $1 {There is no
convincing way for Black to prepare this break further, while it is not
obviously bad, so it should be played.} (17... Bg5 18. Qe2 {and b5 has become
out of the question.}) (17... Kh8 18. Nd3 (18. h4 $6 f5 19. h5 gxh5 $17 {
[%cal Gh5h4]}) 18... f5 19. f4 Bf6 20. Kh1 Qe7 21. exf5 gxf5 22. fxe5 Nxe5 23.

struggling to keep Black's activity under the lid. For instance:} 21. exf5 gxf5
22. Bh3 Bg7 23. Kh1 Qh4 {backfires.}) (18. Nf3 $5 {is not an easy move to play
when you just came that way, but the f3-g5-idea makes it harder for Black to
develp his initiative on the kingside:} Rf7 19. Bh3 Nf8 $5 20. Ne1 {Ha! We
don't mind going back again.} Bd7 21. Nd3 $132) ({If White still had the dark
squared bishop on the board, then} 18. exf5 gxf5 19. f4 Bf6 20. Kh1 e4 {
, would be good for him. Here, however, Black's bishop is too strong and White
can only hope for a successful defence.}) ({The most direct way to fight for
the light squares (yes, I mean f5) is} 18. Bh3 Nf6 $1 19. Nc2 {[%cal Gc2e3]} f4

21. dxe6 Qc8 22. f3 Qxe6 23. gxf4 exf4 24. Qxf4 Nh5 25. Qd2 {with a complex
game.}) 18... exf4 19. gxf4 fxe4 20. Nxe4 b5 {The game has opened up and the
two most important factors in the position are Black's activity on the b-file
and the weak e6-square. A race to set the opponent serious threats ensues.} 21.
a5 {This move loses a tempo, which is why I would be reluctant to play it. I'm
guessing that Gelfand's reasons for playing it were much more complex than my
reasons for not to.} (21. axb5 axb5 22. Nf3 bxc4 23. bxc4 Nb6 $5 (23... Nf6 24.

order not to end up in a really depressing endgame.}) 21... bxc4 22. bxc4 Rb4

of the game for Black, as the e6-pawn is well blockaded and rather obstructs
White.}) 25... Ng4 $1 {which sets White some serious problems.}) 25. Nd3 Ra4
26. Qe3 Qd8 ({Black loses important time here, but the alternative} 26... Re8
27. Bh3 $1 Bf8 28. Be6+ Bxe6 29. Nxe6 {is even better for White.}) 27. Rce1 {
White has the worst behind him.} Bf5 {Now the game gets very tense. The next
few moves are very forcing and I presume that Radjabov had planned it up to
move 33...Ra2, at least.} 28. Bh3 $1 {White's life depends on whether he can
tuck a knight in on e6 without it being exchanged.} (28. Ne6 Qc8 $1 29. Bh3

sample-line-territory by now.} Kxf8 33. Ne5 Rd4 34. Nc6 Rxf4 35. Nxe7 {is
about equal, but only leaves Black with winning chances.}) 28... Nxd5 $3 {
A splendid move, without which Black would be clearly worse.} 29. cxd5 Bxg5 30.

that Radjabov must have evaluated before playing 28...Nxd5 (and he must have
spotted it at least a move before that, or Bf5 would not have made much sense).

consequences) then} 34. Qe4 {is the safest bet:} Qd2 35. Qe7+ Kg8 (35... Kh6

rooks (and the human view is pretty much spot on here).} ({After} 36... a5 37.

possibly worse. The main problem is that the knight is awfully placed on d3.

advantage becomes clear.} (38. Nf2 $1 Rd2 (38... a5 39. Re1+ Kd7 40. Ne4 Ra4
