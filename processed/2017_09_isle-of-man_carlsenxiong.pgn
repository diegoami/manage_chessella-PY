1. Nf3 c5 2. c3 {If you like the Slav Defence, then there can hardly be
anything wrong with this move. Xiong does not have the Slav on his repertoire
with Black, so there is also that.} Nf6 3. d4 e6 4. Bg5 {I have not been
following the developments in these lines with enthusiasm, so I don't know a
lot about it. Still, if I was faced with such a set-up with Black I would
immediately kick the bishop with} d5 (4... h6 {to see how White responds.} 5.
Bh4 cxd4 6. cxd4 d5 7. e3 Nc6 {looks like a very decent exchange slav, to me.
However, I would not like to play this against Magnus.}) (4... Qb6 5. Qb3 Nc6 {
also looks fine.}) 5. e3 {Generally speaking, an ambitious player is happy to
be able to take back on d4 with the e-pawn.} h6 6. Bh4 Nc6 7. Nbd2 a6 {Black
takes a very solid approach and avoids Bf1-b5. It's absolutely fine. However,
it is important to get into a mind-set where one doesn't play overly solid.} 8.
Bd3 Be7 9. O-O Nd7 {Again, absolutely fine, but Black is playing a bit too
many non-developing moves for my liking. However, here it seems that there
were no better alternative.} (9... O-O $6 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. dxc5) (9... b6 10.
e4 $36) 10. Bxe7 Nxe7 $5 (10... Qxe7 11. e4 dxe4 12. Bxe4 cxd4 {leaves White
with more than one option:} 13. Bxc6 (13. cxd4 O-O 14. Rc1 Nb4 15. a3 Nd5 16.
Bxd5 exd5 17. Re1 Qd6 18. Ne5 {is also somewhat more comfortable for White.})
13... bxc6 14. Nxd4 {looks like something Carlsen would like for White.}) 11.
Ne5 {This was a surprise to me.} (11. e4 {still looks a little better for
White.}) 11... cxd4 {And this was an even bigger surprise.} ({The natural move
is to just play} 11... Nxe5 12. dxe5 Nc6 {, to see how White will defend the
e-pawn:} 13. f4 (13. Qg4 Qg5 14. Qxg5 hxg5 15. f4 Bd7 {is problem free for
Black.}) (13. Nf3 $6 Qc7) 13... c4 14. Bc2 Qb6 {is just bad for White. Perhaps
Carlsen missed this detail, or he has something mind boggling prepared that I
don't see.}) 12. exd4 Nxe5 13. dxe5 {This position is much better for White
than the one with c5 and e3 still left. The e5-pawn can easily be defended and
White will develop very naturally.} Bd7 14. Re1 $1 (14. Nf3 Bb5 $1) 14... Rc8
15. Nf3 {[%cal Gf3d4]} b5 16. h4 a5 17. a3 Qb6 18. Qd2 {This is all quite
logical. White has small but clear advantage since his minor pieces are much
more active.} b4 (18... O-O 19. Re3 {and White is ready to play Nd4 and launch
an attack on Black's king.}) 19. cxb4 axb4 20. a4 Ra8 21. b3 {Now White has a
stable advantage. The only thing that can become a headache for White is the
c3-square. Black immediately goes for an invasion.} ({It is curious that the
engine suggests} 21. Bb5 $5 {Indeed, after} Bxb5 22. axb5 O-O 23. Nd4 {Black
is horribly passive. In a few moves it will become obvious that White has no
better plan than this, so then it is best not to weaken c3.}) 21... O-O 22.
Rac1 Rfc8 23. h5 $6 (23. Nd4 $1 Kf8 (23... Qxd4 $4 24. Bh7+) 24. Bb5 $16) 23...
Kf8 $6 ({This was the best moment to play} 23... Rc3 $1 {, when} 24. Rxc3 (24.
Nd4 Rac8 25. Rxc3 Rxc3) 24... bxc3 25. Qxc3 Rc8 26. Qd2 (26. Qb2 Bxa4) 26...
Qxb3 27. a5 Bb5 {is equal.}) 24. g4 $1 {Now White breaks through before Black
can stir up enough trouble on the queenside.} ({Again} 24. Bb5 {, suggests
itself.}) ({Also possible is} 24. Qf4 Rc3 25. Bb5 Bxb5 26. Qxb4 Rxc1 27. Rxc1

is} 31... Qd8 $1 32. Qxc3 (32. Rxe6 Qxf6 33. Rxf6 Rc8 34. Nd4 c2 35. Nxc2 Rxc2

Rxg8 Kxg8 37. Nd4 {and I find it hard to believe that Black will survive this,
but the engines are surprisingly optimistic.}) 32. Qxh6 {Black has no defence
against Kh1/Rg1+} Qb4 33. Kh1 1-0
