30. Re1 Bf7 31. Rd7 h6 32. Qd6 Rxd7 33. Qxd7 Rd8 34. Qxa7 Qf4 {The game
is pretty well balanced until this point. Bluebaum could have played Re2,
stopping Rd2, and the position would have been round about equal. But
he saw nothing wrong with the most natural move in the position - the
knight jump to d5, and went for it. Do you see why it is such a huge mistake?}
35. Nd5 $2 (35. Qxb6 Rd2 $19) 35... Rxd5 $1 {As you near the time control
(40 moves) such oversights are bound to happen.} (35... Bxd5 36. Qxb6

Qf2+.} 37. Kh1 (37. Rf1 Qd4 $1 {threatening e2.} 38. Kh1 (38. Qb8+ Kh7

$19 {The a5 square is controlled by the pawn on b6 and the g3 square by
the pawn on h4! There is no way that the white queen can help here!})
37... Bxd5 $1 {Although it doesn't make a huge difference it is nice that
the a8 and b8 both the checking squares are controlled by the black pieces.}
38. Rg1 h3 $1 {All of Black's pieces work in perfect unison.} 39. Qxb6
hxg2+ 40. Rxg2+ Bxg2+ 41. Kxg2 Qg4+ {With a quick mate. Very sharp tactical
play by Aleksandr Rakhmanov.} 0-1
