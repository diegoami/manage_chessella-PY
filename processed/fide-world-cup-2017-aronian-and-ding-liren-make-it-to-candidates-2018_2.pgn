cxd5  cxd5  14. Qb5 {[%emt 0:00:04] This position has been reached four times
before and has been played by strong players like Berkes and Nikolic.} Ra5  15.

Liren said he saw this but didn't like that White could defend b3 with Ra3.})
18. Bc3 $1  axb3  19. Ng5 $1 {[%emt 0:00:24] This was missed by Ding Liren.} b2
 (19... Bxg2 20. Kxg2 $18) 20. Rab1 { [%emt 0:00:11] At this point it seemed as
White is just winning as the knight on d3 is trapped. But Ding Liren finds the
best practical try.} Nxf2 $1  21. Qxf2  Bxb1  22. Rxb1  e5  23. Nh3 $6 {[%emt
0:01:43] This is passive. Wesley played this and offered a draw. Ding Liren
thought for a bit, saw that he has easy moves to make and more time on the
clock and hence went ahead and declined the draw offer.} (23. Nf3 $14) 23...

Nf4  Qc4  27. Bxd5 {[%emt 0:00:22] Finally the pressure became too much for
Wesley to handle and he sacrifices two pieces for a rook.} Rxd5  28. Nxd5  Qxd5
 29. Rxb2  Rc8 {[%emt 0:00:03] Threatening Rxc3.} 30. Rb3  h5 { [%emt 0:00:05]
Even though Black is a pawn down, he is in a completely dominating position.}

won back the pawn and the white king is pretty weak. Ding Liren doesn't miss
this opportunity.} 38. Kh1  Qd5+  39. Rf3  (39. Qg2 $1 {Wesley was not in the
best defensive mood. This would have been a stauncher defence.} Rc1+ 40. Kh2

have won the queen, but gives up the f7 pawn. So Black tries to win the queen
when he can somehow retain all his pawns.}) 42. a4  f6  43. a5  Kg7  44. a6

Kg6  55. Rf2  Qe3+  56. Kg2  Kxg5 {[%emt 0:00:03] All the pawns have been
removed from the board. It's just queen verus rook. Ding Liren shows good
techinque.} 57. Rf3  Qe2+  58. Kg3  Qe1+  59. Kg2  Kg4  60. Rf2  Qe4+  61. Kh2

has cost White the full rook.} 0-1
