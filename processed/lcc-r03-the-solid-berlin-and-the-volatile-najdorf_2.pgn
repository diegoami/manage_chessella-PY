Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. a4 b4 9. d4 d6 10. dxe5 dxe5 {This line of the Anti Marshall is something which Aronian has tremendous experience in with the black pieces. He has already has played eight games in it with top players like Carlsen, Nakamura, Giri, Topalov, Svidler, etc.} 11. Qxd8 Rxd8 12. Nbd2 Bd6 {This move prepares Na5 as now the e5 pawn is defended. Hence White's next move is forced.} 13. a5 h6 14. Bc4 Re8 $1 {Commentators were debating the real motive of this move. Suddenly Levon Aronian comes to the commentary room and says "I want to exchange the light squared bishops to get the b5 square for my rook!" Now this is what we call super GM understanding.} 15. Nb3 Be6 16. Bd3 $1 {Mickey realizes that he shouldn't give up the b5 square and maintains the bishops.} Red8 17. Nfd2 Nd7 18. Nc4 Nc5 19. Nxc5 Bxc5 {Black surely has the more comfortable position but White is still well within the realms of equality.} 20. Be3 Bxe3 21. Nxe3 b3 22. Bf1 Nd4 (22... bxc2 23. Nxc2 Rab8 24. Bxa6 Rxb2 25.

Bxe6 Nxe6 34. Rc2 h5 {Not particularly an exciting game, but Aronian once again proved that this line is pretty good for Black.} 1/2-1/2
