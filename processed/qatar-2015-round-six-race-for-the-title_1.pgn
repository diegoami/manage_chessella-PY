b4 $5 {This is a very interesting pawn sacrifice. What Black intends to do is
to play Nc6 followed by e6 and take control of the b4 square. In this way he
gets a lead in development at the cost of a pawn.} 9. Qxb4 Nc6 10. Qc5 (10. Qb3
Rb8 11. Qd1 Nb4 {is already very bad for White.}) 10... Na5 11. Bxa6 $5 (11.
Qa3 {is the other theoretical move but after} e6 12. b4 Nc6 13. Na2 Bd6 { it
looks somehow that Black has excellent compensation.}) 11... Rxa6 12. Qb5+ Rc6
13. Ne5 Bd7 14. Nxd7 (14. Nxc6 Bxc6 15. Qe2 Nb3 $17 {followed by e6 is clearly
better for Black.}) 14... Nxd7 15. Bd2 $5 (15. Nxd5 e6 16. Bd2 (16. Nc3 $2 Be7
{followed by Qc7 and 0-0 is just better for Black.}) 16... exd5 17. Bxa5 Qa8
{and here Black is ok.}) 15... Qa8 16. Nxd5 e6 17. Nf4 $5 {This is the first
new move in the databases â€“ although truth be told I played the same move
against Abhilash Reddy in the eighth round of Mumbai Mayor's Cup 2014. However
that game did not make it to the databases. White asks Black to defend the a5
knight.} Ra6 (17... Nc4 18. Rc1 $16) 18. O-O (18. d5 {was played by me and
after} e5 19. Nd3 Bd6 20. Rc1 $6 Ke7 $1 {Black was threatening already to trap
my queen with Rb8, and he won the game. Jakovenko found a much better move
order. 0-1 (34) Sagar,S (2309)-Abhilash,R (2189) Mumbai Mayor's Cup 2014.} )
18... Bd6 19. d5 $5 exd5 (19... Bxf4 20. exf4 $16) 20. Rfd1 Nc6 {Jakovenko had
not studied this move and when he reached this position it was quite unclear
for him what is to be done. That is because he had prepared with the computer
and the engine never suggested the move. This is the downside to computer
preparation: often when our opponent deviates we do not know how to continue.
Yet Dmitry is a strong player and could work out the best way to play on the
board.} (20... d4 {is the computer's suggestion, and also what Jakovenko had
prepared.} 21. Bb4 Bxb4 22. Qxb4 Nc6 23. Qa3 {when White has good compensation
as Black cannot 0-0.}) 21. Bc3 (21. Qxd5 Ne7 22. Qxa8+ Rxa8 23. Bc3 (23. a5 $5
$14) 23... Be5 24. Rxd7 Bxc3 25. Rxe7+ Kxe7 26. Nd5+ Kd6 27. Nxc3 Rhb8 $11 {and
Black cannot lose this position.}) 21... Bxf4 (21... O-O { was also possible.})
22. exf4 O-O 23. Rxd5 Nb6 $6 (23... Nf6 {was much better as after} 24. Bxf6
gxf6 $11 {this structure looks ugly, but Black is doing absolutely fine here.})
24. Rg5 $1 g6 (24... f6 {Viktor might have wanted to continue with this move
but later saw that Rxg7 is simply crushing.} 25. Rxg7+ $3 Kxg7 26. Qg5+ Kf7
(26... Kh8 27. Bxf6+ Rxf6 28. Qxf6+ Kg8 29. Ra3 $1 { The rook makes a dramatic
entrance and ends the game.}) 27. Qxf6+ Ke8 28. Re1+ Kd7 29. Qg7+ $1 Kd6 30.
Bb4+ $1 Nxb4 31. Qe7+ Kd5 32. Qe5+ Kc4 33. Qc3+ Kd5 34. Re5+ Kd6 35. Qc5+ Kd7
36. Re7+ Kd8 37. Qc7# {So many black pieces but none of them controlled the key
e5, c5, c7, e7 squares.}) 25. a5 Rd8 26. Re1 Nc8 27. Rd5 Rxd5 $2 (27... Rf8
{would have put up a fight, but White is better after} 28. b4 $18) 28. Re8# {A
fine game by Jakovenko who contributed to the development of the theory in this
variation.} 1-0
