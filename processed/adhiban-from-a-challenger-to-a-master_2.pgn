this needed.",10]} 48. Bh5+ $1 {It is important to expose Black's king further
and also in some lines the pawn on g6 is advantageous for White.} g6 49. Bf3

Bh5 was needed. With a pawn on g7 it would have been a draw, but now it is
winning. This is the answer also to the question that I posed at the start.})

troubled by the black queen.} Qd3 57. Qc3 $16 {and Black is clearly
struggling.}) 54... Bc4 55. Bf3 {[%cal Gf3d5] I thought this more clear, since
I am trying to reach a winning endgame mentioned in the 47...Bc6 variation, but
soon I found that} Qh3 $1 {was very strong and now there wasn't any way to get
an advantage.} 56. Qc7+ Kf6 57. Qc6+ Kf7 58. g4 Qh2 $1 {The last good move
