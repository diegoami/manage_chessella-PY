Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 g6 6. h3 Bg7 7. Nc3 Nd7 8. Be3 b6 (8... e5 {immediately is definitely more common. Black sometimes doesn't play b6 at all, but Hikaru has his own idea.}) 9. Qd2 h6 10. O-O e5 11. Nh2 {Black has trouble here if he plays his usual Nf8-e6 plan. White would be too fast with f4, and overall Black's position would be uncomfortable. Hikaru stops this on its tracks, even though it looks strategically unsound.} g5 12. Ne2 Nf8 13. Ng3 {targetting the weak light squares, of course.} Ng6 14. a3 { With the kingside locked up, Fabiano naturally focuses his attention on a queenside break.} O-O 15. b4 cxb4 16. axb4 Nh4 $5 {Perhaps the objective of this idea with Nh4 and f5 is dubious, but it is the type of complications that Hikaru always manages to inject into positions that he feels are turning slightly worse.} (16... Nf4 17. Ra3 $14) 17. f3 (17. Nh5 $1 f5 18. Qc3 $1 { would have put Hikaru's idea into question.}) 17... f5 18. exf5 Nxf5 19. Nxf5 Bxf5 20. Ra6 Qe7 21. Ng4 {Trying to get to e4, cementing a strong positional advantage for White clamping down on the center and kingside.} e4 $5 {What a move! Beautiful positional understanding from America's #1. The pawn sacrifice allows Black's bishops to breathe and discoordinates White's pieces.} 22. dxe4 (22. fxe4 Bxg4 23. Rxf8+ Rxf8 24. hxg4 Qd7 (24... Rf7 {gives Black some compensation for the pawn.}) 25. d4 $1 Qxg4 26. e5 $1 {with an advantage.}) 22... Rfd8 23. Qe1 (23. Qe2 {was perhaps a little better.}) 23... Be6 24. Ra3 Bc4 25. Rf2 h5 26. Nh2 {White has been pushed back significantly.} Bb2 (26... a5 $1 {This would have been a very nice tactical blow} 27. Bxb6 {what else?} Qxb4 28. Qxb4 {forced} axb4 29. Rxa8 Rxa8 {and Black's monstrous bishops give him enough activity for an advantage, even with the pawn deficit.}) 27. Ra4 Qe5 28. Nf1 $1 {White's rook is trapped but he understands the need to activate his pieces} Qb5 29. Ra1 $1 Bxa1 30. Qxa1 Bxf1 31. Rxf1 Rd6 {Now it is White's activity that more than compensates for the material disadvantage. Black is too exposed on the kingside.} 32. Qa2+ Kg7 33. Qb2+ (33. f4 $1 {was much stronger, ripping apart the kingside and making Hikaru's king very nervous.} Qe2 34. Qa1+ Kh7 35. Re1 $1 $16) 33... Kh7 34. Ra1 a6 35. Rc1 {with a not very subtle threat of c4.} (35. c4 Qxc4 36. Bxb6 $14 {still kept some edge.}) 35... Qe2 $1 36. Qb3 Rg8 37. Qf7+ {Now a perpetual finishes the game.} Rg7 38. Qf5+ Kg8 39. Qc8+ Kh7 40.
