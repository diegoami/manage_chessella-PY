40... Bd6 41. Nh6+ Ke7 $19 {and Black will end up with material enough to win
more than one game.}) 41. Nxe5+ Qxe5 42. Bxf4 $1 {The shot that was missed.}
Bxc4 (42... Qxf4 43. Qxd5+ {would be worse.}) (42... e3+ {does not help to win.
} 43. Kg3 $11) 43. Bxe5 Rg8 44. Rh8 $1 {The easiest way to equalise. The
opposite coloured Bishop ending is an easy draw as the distance between Black's
