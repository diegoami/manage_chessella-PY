1. c4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e3 Nf6 4. b3 Be7 5. Bb2 O-O 6. Nc3 dxc4 7. bxc4 c5 8. Rg1
Nc6 9. g4 {[#] The white attack attempt may look double-edged,
but it is by no means easy for Black to handle it adequately.
Incidentally, this has already been played in a blitz game between
Grischuk and Kramnik, won by Grischuk.} e5 10. g5 Ne8 11. Qb1 f5 12. gxf6
Nxf6 13. Be2 Kh8 14. Ng5 h6 15. Nf3 Ne8 16. Nd5 Bf5 17. d3 Bd6 18. Bc3 Rb8 19.
Qb2 {[#] Black had already spent a lot of time thinking about this.
In fact, there was no clear remedy against the white attack on
kingside - something like the proverbial "counter-attack in the center" wasn't available. So Black was dependent on piece play 
but his choice was rather drastic.} Bxd3 {He finds the counter-attack in the
centre after all. The small combination wins a pawn, but the postion falls clearly in White's favour.} 20. Bxd3 Rxf3 21. Qe2 $1 Rf8 22. Qh5
Ne7 {[#] White has a winning position: All the pieces are well placed and
ready to attack the black king position.} 23. Rxg7 (23. f4 {
to open the c3-g7 diagonal of for the bishop looks more sustainable.}) 23...
Kxg7 (23... Nxg7 24. Qxh6+ Kg8 25. Nxe7+ {wins.}) 24. O-O-O {The thing is
now, despite the continued white advantage, matters are not so clear.} (24.
f4 {was still good here too.}) 24... Rf7 $1 25. Rg1+ Kf8 26. Qxh6+ Rg7 27.
Rxg7 Nxg7 28. Qf6+ Kg8 29. Bxe5 Nef5 30. Bxf5 Qxf6 31. Nxf6+ Kf7 32. Bxd6 Rd8

Bc6 Rb2+ 40. Ke1 Rb4 {[#] The players reach time control. Rarely do you see that a player survives such a strong attack unscathed. Now Bluebaum manages to reach a draw step-by-step.} 41. a5 Rxc4 42. a6 Rb4 43. Bb7 Ke6 44. Bc8+ Kf6 45. Kd2 Rb2+ 46.
Kd3 Rxf2 47. Ke4 Ra2 48. Be5+ Kg5 49. Bb8 Ra4+ 50. Ke5 c4 51. Bxf5 Ra5+ 52. Kd4

Rc3+ 65. Kg2 Rb3 {This endgame is a draw - the simple rule to follow is that the
king should head for the corner of the color opposite his bishop, as every grandmaster of course knows.} 1/2-1/2
