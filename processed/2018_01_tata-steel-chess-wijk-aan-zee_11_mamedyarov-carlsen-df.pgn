1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 d5 5. cxd5 (5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 {is
another big main line, e.g.} O-O 7. Nf3 dxc4 8. Qxc4 b6 9. Bg5 $11 {, which
was the path followed by Ivanchuk,V-Harikrishna,P Huaian 2017}) 5... Qxd5 6. e3
(6. Nf3 Qf5 $1 $11 {has now become famous, and after some wrangling it has
become clear that only Black can actually have a positional edge in the
endgame, despite his doubled f-pawns!}) 6... c5 7. Bd2 Bxc3 8. Bxc3 cxd4 9.
Bxd4 Nc6 10. Bc3 (10. Bxf6 gxf6 11. Ne2 {is the initial computer
recommendation, but this really isn't that good after say} Bd7 12. a3 Qa5+ 13.
Nc3 Ne7 $11 {Dreev,A -Fedoseev,V Moscow 2014}) 10... O-O 11. Nf3 Rd8 {Else Rd1
is slightly annoying.} 12. Be2 (12. Rd1 Qxd1+ 13. Qxd1 Rxd1+ 14. Kxd1 Ne4 15.
Be1 e5 $11 {is another equal position, where White's bishop pair isn't yet
active enough to give him any advantage.}) 12... Qe4 13. Rc1 Qxc2 14. Rxc2 Nd5
(14... Bd7 15. Nd4 Ne7 $11 {could be worth considering for the future; White's
bishop pair is a lot less scary when there is an extra pair of knights on the
board.}) 15. Ne5 Bd7 {This is the novelty!} (15... Nxe5 16. Bxe5 b6 17. a3 f6
18. Bg3 Bb7 19. O-O Rac8 20. Rfc1 e5 21. Rxc8 Rxc8 22. Rxc8+ Bxc8 23. Kf1 {
somehow led to one of the world's best defensive players being ground down in
Grachev,B-Karjakin,S Antalya 2017; the problem is that White can keep trying
things and never runs any risk at all.}) 16. Nxc6 Bxc6 17. Bd2 Ne7 18. f3 Rac8
19. e4 (19. Ba5 $5 b6 20. Bb4 Nd5 21. Bd2 $14 {prevents Black from playing ...
a6 and ...Bb5}) 19... f6 20. Be3 a6 21. Kf2 (21. Bc4 $5 Kf7 22. Bb3 Bb5 23. Kf2
{and we can still talk about a White edge based on the bishop pair}) 21... Bb5
$1 {Black has equalised again.} 22. Rhc1 Rxc2 23. Rxc2 Bxe2 24. Kxe2 Nc6 $11 {
There is nothing really left to play for. Black can choose between an ...e5
based plan, and a rook-exchange based plan.} 25. b4 Rc8 26. Rc5 b5 27. f4 Kf7
