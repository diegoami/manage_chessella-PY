13. Bh4 g5 14. Bg3 Rc8 {Black can be satisfied. The kingside becomes
a bit weak after the exchange of the g3-bishop, but he has a clear target on c3 to work with.} 15. Nd2 Qe7 {1/2-1/2 (81) Ju,W (2557)

queenside. Nevertheless, it is surprising how quickly the black initiative becomes serious.} (16. Ne5 $1 {was necessary. Keeping control of the critical c4 square is key to White's position.}) 16... Nc4 $1
17. a3 (17. Bd3 {[%cal Gd3c4] Can it be that by exchanging the strongest black piece, White might aver the worst?} Nxb2 $1 {No!} 18. Qxb2 Qa5 19. O-O $1 (19. Kd2 $6 Rhf8 $40 {
[%csl Rc3,Rf2,Rf3]}) 19... Bxc3 20. Qe2 Bxa1 21. Rxa1 $44 {and white can
hope to conjure counterplay out of a hat. The knight will be superbly
placed on e5, and the black king is extremely vulnerable in the center.})
17... Qa5 18. Rc1 Bxc3+ 19. Qxc3 Qxc3+ 20. Rxc3 Nxb2 {Black has won a pawn, but the first wave of attack is beaten off. Salomon should take the time now to improve the position of his pieces.}
21. hxg5 $2 {too cheap - now Black takes over the helm again.} (21. Rc7
$5) ({after} 21. Ne5 {and hhe can hope for full compensation. The trick is,
that on} Rac8 22. Rb3 $1 {follows, and the rook can be sacrificed on h1} Rc1+
