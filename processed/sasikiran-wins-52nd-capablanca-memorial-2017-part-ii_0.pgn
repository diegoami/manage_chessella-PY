1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. e5 d5 7. Be2 {I knew
that Ne4 was the main line. But at the board ...d3 started to look very
interesting.} d3 {It was an over the board decision. I found it interesting and
I saw that I am winning the two bishops, so why not?!} (7... Ne4 {is the main
move.}) 8. exf6 dxe2 9. Qxe2+ Be6 {This is the more human move. You block with
the bishop and you put your king on the other side. And I felt that I could
regain the pawn on g7 anyway. But there are some problems as my opponent showed
in the game.} (9... Kf8 $5 {After the game I checked and saw some
correspondence games have been played with this move. I saw it during the game,
but I did not like Bg5.} 10. Bg5 Qd6 {This looks playable. The main idea is to
have quick development with Bg4 and Re8.}) 10. fxg7 Rg8 11. b4 $1 {This is a
very strong. Now he gets in b5 and has control on the crucial e5 and d4
squares. I think my opponent played really well from this point onwards.} Be7
12. b5 Na5 13. Bf4 Rxg7 14. O-O Bf6 {I was already quite unhappy with my
position. White is threatening a move like Be5 to further increase his control
on the dark squares in the centre. The d4 and e5 squares are completely out of
my control and going into any endgame would be a bad idea because my kingside
pawns are very weak.} 15. Nbd2 Qe7 16. Rfe1 O-O-O 17. Qe3 b6 18. Be5 Rg6 $6 {
This was already a clear error. I had to play Bh3 in this position, but even
then it wouldn't have changed the evaluation much.} (18... Bh3 19. g3 Bxe5 20.
Qxe5 Qxe5 21. Nxe5 $16 {[%cal Gd2f3,Gf3d4] and with the other knight coming to
d4, I think White is clearly better.}) 19. Nd4 Bd7 20. Bxf6 Qxf6 21. Qe5 $6 {
The reason why I don't like this exchange from White's point of view is because
with the queens on the board I could have never been able to play a move like
c5. But with the queens gone I was able to play it and free my position a bit.}
(21. g3 $1 Re8 22. Qf3 Qxf3 23. N2xf3 $14 {is a much better situation in which
the queen exchange has taken place.}) 21... Qxe5 22. Rxe5 c5 $1 {I already
started to feel a bit positive about my position.} 23. bxc6 Nxc6 24. Rxd5 Nxd4
25. Rxd4 Rc6 26. Rc1 Be6 27. Rxd8+ Kxd8 28. Nb3 Bxb3 $2 {A bad decision by me.
I felt that after axb3 I can play b5 and a5-a4 and liquidate the queenside. He
will take my a4 pawn, I will take his c3 pawn, but I completely missed his idea
of bringing the king to the queenside to defend the c3 pawn.} (28... Rc7 {Next
up is Ke7 and then Rc4-a4 and it should be a draw.}) 29. axb3 a5 30. Kf1 Kc7
(30... b5 31. Ke2 a4 32. bxa4 bxa4 33. Kd3 {The a-pawn will be lost.}) 31. Ke2
Re6+ 32. Kd3 Rd6+ 33. Kc2 Rg6 34. g3 Rh6 35. Re1 Kd6 36. h4 Rf6 37. f4 Rg6 38.
Re3 h5 39. Kd3 Kc6 40. c4 Rd6+ 41. Kc3 Rg6 42. b4 axb4+ 43. Kxb4 Rg8 {Until
here White has played very well, but now he goes wrong.} 44. Ra3 $6 {White had
to go for concrete actions with Re5. But Ra3 doesn't spoil anything because he
can go for Re5 later also. However, with this one can realize that he wasn't
keen to go into that line.} (44. Re5 $1 {It was important for White to indulge
in some sort of concrete calculations. This move wins.} Rxg3 45. Rxh5 {Now the
threat is to play Rf5.} Rg4 46. Rh6+ $1 {An important intermediate check,
pushing the king back.} (46. Rf5 {I think he missed Rh6+ and was thiking about
this move.} Rxh4 47. Rf6+ (47. Rxf7 Rh3 48. f5 Rf3 {and this holds as well.})
47... Kd7 48. Rxf7+ Ke6 {holds for Black.}) 46... Kd7 {The idea of this move is
to save the f7 pawn if White goes Rf6 with Ke7.} (46... Kc7 $6 47. Rf6 $1 Rxh4
48. Kb5 Rh5+ 49. f5 $18 {White takes the f7 pawn and is just winning.}) 47. h5
$1 Rh4 (47... Rxf4 48. Rxb6 $18 {followed by h6 is just winning.}) 48. Rxb6
Rxh5 49. Rb5 $1 {An important move. } Rh1 50. Rd5+ $1 {Such checks are easy to
miss, but once you see it you realize the importance of it.} Kc7 (50... Ke7
{Now the king is cut off and White can freely advance his c-pawn along with the
king.}) (50... Kc6 51. Rf5 Rb1+ 52. Kc3 Rc1+ 53. Kd4 Rd1+ 54. Ke5 Rc1 55. Rxf7
$18) 51. Rf5 $18 {just wins.}) 44... Rg7 45. Rd3 Rg8 46. Re3 Rg6 47. Rd3 Rg8
48. Kc3 Rg6 49. Re3 Rg8 50. Kb4 Rg6 51. Ra3 Rg7 52. Ra6 $2 {This was clearly an
error.} Rxg3 (52... Kc7 {was perhaps more accurate, but Rxg3 draws as well.})
53. c5 Rg4 54. Rxb6+ Kd7 {This was important so that to Rf6 I can attack his
rook.} 55. Rf6 Ke7 $1 56. Rf5 Rxh4 57. c6 Rh1 58. Kb5 h4 59. c7 Rc1 60. Kb6 h3
61. Rh5 Kd7 62. Rd5+ Ke6 63. Rd3 h2 64. Re3+ Kd7 65. Rd3+ Ke6 66. Re3+ Kd7 67.
Rd3+ {Saving this endgame boosted my confidence. You start to feel as if luck
is on your side. 6. 5/10 in the tournament with three wins and seven draws
looks very clean, but when you start analyzing the games you realize how
complex things were!} 1/2-1/2
