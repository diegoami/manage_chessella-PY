{Of the round 3 games featuring people who are currently on 100%, it was a
no-brainer for me to choose to annotate the Grunfeld one.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6
3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Nf3 c5 9. Be2 Bg4 (
9... Nc6 {gives White easy play, like the game.} 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 Bg4 12.
d5 $14) (9... b6 {is my personal favourite way to play the Grunfeld, against
this and other White setups.}) 10. O-O cxd4 11. cxd4 Nc6 {Obviously, 9...Nc6
also led to this position. With the incisive next move White lays claim to an
advantage.} 12. d5 Bxf3 (12... Ne5 13. Nxe5 Bxe2 14. Qxe2 Bxe5 15. Rac1 Qd7 16.
Rc2 $14) 13. Bxf3 Bxa1 14. Qxa1 Na5 15. Bh6 f6 16. Bxf8 ({It was also possible
to delay the acceptance of Black's gift:} 16. Bg4 $16) 16... Kxf8 17. Bg4 (17.
e5 $5 Nc4 18. exf6 exf6 19. Qd4 Ne5 20. Rb1 $14) 17... Nc4 {Now Black at least
has some squares for his knight and queen and can make some trouble.} 18. Be6 (
18. a4 a6 19. Qc3 b5 20. Rb1 $14) 18... b5 19. Re1 Qb8 20. g3 a6 $11 {The
development scheme with ...Qe5 and ...Ra7 is an impeccable one.} 21. Kg2 Qe5
22. Qc1 (22. f4 Qxa1 23. Rxa1 Ra7 $11) 22... Kg7 23. Qc2 Qd4 24. Rd1 Qe5 25.

32. Kh3 Qc1 $6 (32... h5 {would have left the ball very much in White's court
as to how he wants to push e5 through.}) 33. e5 $1 Nxe5 $1 (33... fxe5 34. fxe5
Qh6+ 35. Kg2 $16) 34. Rd1 (34. fxe5 $4 Rc2 $19) 34... Qc4 35. Qe1 {The
position is really fascinating, with quite a few options for both sides. The
move played by Black was sufficient.} Nf3 (35... Qxa2 $1 {was another way to
keep the result up in the air:} 36. fxe5 Rc2 $13 {and White could very easily
get mated if he wasn't careful.}) (35... Nd3 36. Qe3 $18) 36. Qe3 $1 Qc3 37.
Rd3 $1 (37. Qf2 $5 {followed by Kg2 was the computer's suggested clincher, but
Black has an amazing reply.} Rc4 $3 (37... h5 38. Kg2 Qa3 $1 39. d6 $1 exd6 40.
Rf1 $1 Rc3 41. Qa7+ Kh6 42. Rxf3 Rxf3 43. Qa8 $3 $18) 38. d6 Rd4 $3 {Now my
computer 'wakes up' to Black's tactics.} 39. dxe7 (39. Rxd4 Nxd4 40. dxe7 Qc6
41. Bg4 h5 $11) 39... Qc6 40. Bg4 (40. Qxf3 Qxf3 41. e8=Q Qh5+ 42. Kg2 Qe2+ $11
) 40... Rxd1 41. Bxf3 Qc8+ 42. Bg4 Rd7 $1 $11) 37... Ng1+ $2 {A shame.} (37...
Qb2 $1 38. Qxf3 Rc2 39. Qh1 h5 $13 {still leaves everything to play for}) 38.
Kg2 Qb2+ (38... Qc1 39. Qxc1 Rxc1 40. Bg4 Rc2+ 41. Kxg1 f5 42. Bf3 Rxa2 $16 {
could be worth a try}) 39. Rd2 Qc1 40. Bg4 $3 {Returning to d1. Now White is
winning with some care.} Kf8 41. Bd1 Rc5 (41... Rc3 42. Qf2 $18 {doesn't help})
42. Qf2 Qc4 43. Rd4 {Since White is winning a piece and Black has not managed
to get a bind or even a pawn for it, it was time to resign.} 1-0
