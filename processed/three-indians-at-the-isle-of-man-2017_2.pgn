1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3 dxc4 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. Qa4 Bd7 {[%cal Gc8d7]
This was Nigel's try to take the game into uncharted territory, but gives White
a small and risk-free edge.} (6... Bb4+ {is the main move in this position.})
7. Qxc4 Bd6 (7... Na5) 8. O-O O-O 9. Nc3 a6 10. Bg5 {Swapnil would like to
eliminate the knight on f6 and then continue by putting his knight on e4 and
creating a lot of pressure on the queenside with moves like Nc5, rooks coming
to c1 and d1 and so on.} h6 11. Bxf6 Qxf6 12. Rac1 Rfc8 13. Ne4 Qe7 14. Nc5
Rab8 (14... Bxc5 15. Qxc5 Qxc5 16. Rxc5 $14 {looks like a small edge for
White.}) 15. Rfd1 Be8 16. e3 Nd8 {This knight on d8 turns out to be the crucial
factor in the game. It's Black's worst piece and he isn't able to improve it.}

Raa8 26. Nxd6 $1 {This exchange was an important one for White. It could lead
to a position that is quite drawish in nature, but Swapnil had seen that he
maintains a slight pull.} cxd6 27. Ne4 d5 28. Rxc8 Rxc8 29. Nc5 { [%csl
Rb7,Gc5,Rd8]} e5 (29... b6 30. Nd7 $14) 30. Nd7 $1 exd4 31. Rxd4 Ne6 32. Rxd5
{White is a pawn up now. The conversion is by no means simple, but Swapnil
manages to pull it through.} Rc4 33. a5 Rb4 34. h4 g5 35. h5 $1 { [%csl
Rf5][%cal Gh4h5,Gd7f5] Fixing the pawn on h6.} Kg7 36. Ne5 Nf8 37. Nd3 Rb3 38.
Nc5 Rb1 39. Ne4 b6 40. Nd6 $1 bxa5 41. Rxa5 {Now the f7 pawn is weak and Nf5+
is in the air. Black will lose another pawn.} Nd7 42. Nf5+ Kh7 43. Ra6 g4
(43... Rb6 44. Rxb6 Nxb6 45. g4 $18 {This looks like a winning knight
endgame.}) 44. Rxh6+ Kg8 45. Ra6 Ne5 46. Ra5 f6 47. Ra4 Kh7 48. Ra7+ Kh8 49.
Nh6 f5 50. Nf7+ $1 {This simplifies the game into a winning rook endgame.} Nxf7

quote - pawns are the soul of chess!} 1-0
