Nf3 g6 3. c4 $5 {Is this a Rapport special? He had tried this same move against Maxim Rodshtein in Politiken Cup 2014.} c6 4. e3 Bg7 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. d4 $5 {The position resembles some sort of a Stonewall setup, but the pawn is on c4 instead of c3, which gives White much more flexibility.} O-O 7. Be2 e6 { Now we are in some sort of virgin territory.} 8. O-O dxc4 $6 {Giving up the centre is not at all a good idea.} 9. Bxc4 Nbd7 10. e4 {Could White have imagined getting such a nice position after just ten moves by playing 1.e4 or 1.d4? I do not think so!} b5 11. Bd3 b4 12.
