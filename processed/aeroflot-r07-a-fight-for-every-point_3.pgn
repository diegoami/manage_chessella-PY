Qxg5 28. a6 Nb5 {Diagram [#] First of all let's calculate the material. White
has a rook and a pawn for two minor pieces. The pawn on a6 however is extremely
strong which determines White's advantage. A lot of things are happening
tactically here. The queen on a7 is attacked and so is the rook on a1. White
can play Qd7 but after Rd8 Black would be able to win the rook on a1 anyway.
Moiseenko here is able to find the combination which might not be very
difficult for a player of his calibre but still is quite pretty.} 29. Rxe2 $1
Nxa7 (29... Rxe2 30. Qb8+ Kg7 31. Ra4 $1 {One cannot be sure if Alexander had
seen this move. The threat is Rg4.} h5 32. Rf4 Qe5 33. Qb7 $18 {Black is a
piece up but his forces are so badly co-ordinated that he has absolutely no
chance in this position.}) 30. Rxe8+ Kg7 31. Rb1 $1 {The rook is coming to b8
and the bishop on h8 will be lost. Quite a weird trapped piece, don't you
agree?} Qc5 32. Rbb8 Qxf2 33. Rxh8 Nc6 34. Rhg8+ Kh6 35. Rb1 Ne5 36. Rf1 Qb6
37. Rf6+ Ng6 38. Rxd6 {The rook is taboo due to a7 when the pawn queens.} Qf2
39. Rf6 Qa2 40. Rf8 {A very nice tactical performance by the Ukrainian
grandmaster.} 1-0
