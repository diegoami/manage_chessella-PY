1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. d4 Bb4 4. e3 O-O 5. Nf3 ({This slightly unusual move
order looks slighty less flexible than} 5. Bd3 {, but that's all. There is no
real downside to it otherwise.}) 5... b6 6. Bd3 Bb7 ({One of the most critical
lines against the Rubinstein system is seen after} 6... d5 $1 7. cxd5 exd5 8.
O-O Ba6 {This position has been played a lot in the last years. The most
ambitious try was seen in Wojtaszek,R -Harikrishna,P Huaian 2016:} 9. Bxa6 Nxa6

7. O-O d5 8. cxd5 exd5 9. Ne5 $5 Nbd7 {This natural move seems slightly inexact
to me.} ({I prefer} 9... Bd6 {, when} 10. f4 c5 11. Ne2 Nc6 $1 { is a clear
improvement on the game (for Black) since the d4-pawn comes under direct
attack, thus making it harder for White to continue with Ne2-g3.}) (9... c5 {is
similar, when} 10. f4 Nc6 11. Ne2 {, but here Black needs to find a way to deal
with the bishops awkward position on b4. In a recent game Black did not deal
with it in the best manner:} c4 {(I don't like playing such a move unless Black
is able to get a clear grip on e4 in such a way that it is possible to jump in
with the knight and take back with a piece.)} 12. Bc2 Ne7 13. Ng3 Nc8 {This is
logical and strives to set in motion the kind of idea that I mentioned in the
parenthesis above, but it also seems too slow.} 14. Nh5 Be7 15. b3 cxb3 16.

(2805)-Karjakin,S (2770) Saint Louis Rapid 2017. After Bb7 there is no defence
against Qh3/Rf1-f3-g3.}) 10. f4 Ne4 $6 11. Nxe4 dxe4 12. Bc4 {White's set-up is
ideal and it is almost impossible for Black to expel the knight from e5.} Qe7
13. a3 Bd6 14. b4 Nf6 15. Bb2 c6 {Built on the assumption that the d5-square
can be used for the knight, but this is easier said than done. Still, it's hard
for Black to come up with a decent remedy against Qb3, Rc1, etc.} 16. Qc2 b5 $1

something, but this seems rather too cool.} ( {The direct} 18. bxa5 $1 Rxa5 19.

continuation} Nd5 20. Qxe4 Bxa3 21. Rxa3 Rxa3 22. Bxa3 Qxa3 23. Rb1 {,leaves
White clearly better, although Black can still fight on with} Bc8 {hoping for}

c-pawn is safely defended and it is very unclear how White can build up more
pressure.} 20. Ra7 (20. g4 {is quite messy after} Nd5 21. Qxe4 f6 (21... Nxb4

ugly for both sides and still balanced.}) 20... Bb8 {is a dead end}) 20. Rxa8

the pawns, also wins easily.}) 26... Rxf7 27. Nxf7+ Qxf7 28. Qxb4 Nxd5 29. Qxb5
