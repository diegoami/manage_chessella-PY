[#]} Rh8 $3 {-1.42/142 72 This move brought no end of compliments by the grandmasters for both the depth of the concept and the elegance of the execution. And for the fact that Deus understood how good the move was. Black is now preparing the onslaught on White's king.} 25. dxe5 {77 (f4)} Raf8 $1 {-1.65/165 67 Black is not remotely concerned with material here, and again plays the most aggressive and active move.} 26. Qxd6 {47 [#] It is now down two pawns after Qxd6, but its evaluation just increases. This is symptomatic of its play, as it has learned to evaluate positions on what it feels offer the best scoring percentage, and not material counts.} Rf7 {-1.83/183 0} 27. c4 {22} h4 $1 { -2.78/22 65 So what does it think of its position exactly? -2.78} 28. c5 {13} Qh5 {-2.81/25 10} 29.
