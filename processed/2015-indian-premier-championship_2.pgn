1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. O-O Qe7 {Played after a 19 minute
think. It's curious what was going on in Neelotpal's mind. I would be a little
amazed if Neelotpal was caught by surprise here considering that Karthikeyan
has played that line more than once in the recent past.} 6. d4 f6 $6 {I already
can't find this move played anywhere.} 7. dxe5 fxe5 8. Qd3 Nf6 9. Nbd2 Bg4 10.
Nc4 Nd7 11. Qc3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qe6 13. Qc3 Bc5 (13... Bd6 14. Be3 O-O) 14. Be3
Bxe3 15. Nxe3 O-O-O {White just has a pleasant edge here, but it's not as big
as it appears. Black's pawn structure is of course inferior to White's, but
with the queen's on board and the opposite side castling, it's not the only
factor in operation.} 16. a4 Nf6 17. f3 Rd4 18. b4 (18. Nf5 Rd7 19. b4 b6
{transposes to the game}) 18... b6 19. Nf5 (19. b5 {is coolly met with} cxb5
20. axb5 a5) 19... Rd7 20. Ne3 Rd4 21. Qe1 Kb7 22. Nd1 g5 23. a5 { With pawns
on b6 and a6 and the opposition pawns on a4-b4 it's usually quite common to
counter a5 with b5 and b5 with a5.} g4 $2 {It seems to me that it was important
not to allow pathway to a6. After this move, Black was reduced down to a minute
and hell breaks loose in all sectors of Black's position.} ({ Better was} 23...
b5 $5 24. Nf2 Qc4 25. Nd3 (25. Qe3) 25... Nd7 26. Rf2 h5 { holds the balance})
(23... Rhd8 {Doesn't manage to prevent pressure on a6} 24. axb6 cxb6 25. Ne3
Rd2 26. Qc1 $16 {with the idea of Qa3.}) 24. axb6 cxb6 25. c3 Rd7 26. fxg4 Nxg4
27. Qe2 Ra8 $2 {The decisive mistake according to the computer. However with
just a minute remaining, it's not easy to play a move like b5 without
calculation, since it permanently weakens c5.} ({Better was} 27... b5 28. h3
Nf6 29. c4 {with the idea of freeing the a2 square} (29. Nf2 Rhd8) (29. Nb2
Rhd8 30. Qe3 Qe7) 29... Ra8 30. Nc3 $40 {looks very unappealing to a human
player}) 28. Nb2 Nf6 29. Na4 Rg7 $4 {Black loses the game in a straightforward
way now.} (29... Rd6 {just defending against the double attack. Black's
position is unenviable, but there's nothing straightforward yet.}) 30. Qf2 Nd7
31. Qxb6+ Kc8 32. Qe3 Kb7 33. Rad1 Rag8 34. Rxd7+ 1-0
