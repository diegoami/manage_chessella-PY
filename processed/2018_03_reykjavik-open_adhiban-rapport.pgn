1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. e4 b5 6. Be2 $5 {Slightly unusual,
but it makes Black watch out for move order ideas.} (6. e5 {is the main move,
though right now the yellow brick road is not paved with success for White.}
Nd5 7. a4 e6 (7... Nxc3 $6 {seems to perform terribly these days:} 8. bxc3 e6
9. Ng5 Be7 10. Qh5 $14 {Fontaine,R-Nadj Hedjesi,B Subotica 2005}) 8. axb5 (8.
Be2 {is the latest fashion, which explains why White wanted to try it on move
6!}) 8... Nxc3 9. bxc3 cxb5 10. Ng5 Bb7 11. Qh5 g6 {Now White has two options,
and both have substantial pedigree, as we shall see.} 12. Qg4 (12. Qh3 {
acquiesces to a draw:} Be7 13. Qh6 Bf8 14. Qh3 Nd7 $5 15. Be2 Be7 16. Bf3 $44 {
Petrosian,T-Smyslov,V Gagra/Voronovo 1952}) 12... Bd5 13. h4 h6 14. Ne4 Nd7 {
White still has compensation, but he must be careful lest his attack stall, as
indeed it did in Nakamura,H-Carlsen,M Gjovik 2009}) 6... e6 {Sensible.} ({
A range of other moves may be tried, including the needlessly creative} 6... g6
$5) 7. O-O Be7 {Now White seems to be able to win back his pawn, though this
is not such a dramatic accomplishment as it might sound.} (7... Bb7 {is
probably marginally better, intending to meet a4 with ...a6.}) 8. a4 b4 9. e5
$1 bxc3 (9... Nd5 10. Ne4 Ba6 11. Bd2 {fails to keep the pawn, but White gets
no advantage after taking it back, e.g.} O-O 12. Rc1 Qb6 13. Bxc4 Nc3 $1 $11)
10. exf6 Bxf6 11. bxc3 Ba6 12. Ne5 $1 {The precision here indicates to us that
White was probably still in his preparation.} (12. Ba3 {seems infinitely more
natural to me, but here Black is able to keep control of his centre:} Nd7 13.
Nd2 Be7 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Bxc4 Bxc4 16. Nxc4 O-O $11) 12... Bxe5 (12... O-O 13.
Ba3 Be7 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Bf3 {is a lot less comfortable for Black than the
last note, because Black lacks a way of developing his knight. The best might
now be to bail out:} f6 16. Nxc6 Nxc6 17. Bxc6 Rac8 18. d5 $14) 13. dxe5 Qxd1
14. Rxd1 Nd7 15. f4 {White has now consolidated his advantage, since with the
best will in the world Black will not manage either to take White's bishop
pair or retain his c6 pawn.} Nb6 (15... O-O-O 16. Rd6 Kc7 17. Bf3 Bb7 18. Ba3
Nb6 (18... c5 19. Bxb7 Kxb7 20. Rb1+ Kc7 21. Rb5 $14) 19. Rxd8 Rxd8 20. Bd6+
Kd7 21. a5 Nd5 22. a6 $14 {Black has defended well, but now the c4 and c3
pawns get exchanged, and White wins a7 into the bargain.}) 16. Rd6 O-O 17. Bf3
Nc8 $2 {Richard Rapport is not well renowned for his patient handling of
uninspiring or passive positions.} (17... Nd5 18. Rxc6 Bb7 {is the engine
recommendation, but Black lacks sufficient compensation after} 19. Rxc4 Nb6 20.
Bxb7 Nxc4 21. Bxa8 Rxa8 22. Rb1 $14) 18. Rxc6 Bb7 19. Rxc8 Raxc8 20. Bxb7 Rb8
21. Ba6 Rb3 {White is completely winning, as long as he takes a modicum of
care.} 22. Ba3 Rd8 23. Bb4 Rd2 24. Bxc4 Rbb2 25. Bf1 h5 26. a5 a6 27. Bc5 g6 {
Presumably, Black saw that White knew to either play Kh1, Bxa6, Bg1, or to
push the c-pawn without further delay. A pivotal game in the return of Adhiban
after his Swiss Gambit.} 1-0
