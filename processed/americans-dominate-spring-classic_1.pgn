Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. h3 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 e6 6. d4 Nf6 7. Bd3 dxe4 8. Nxe4 Qxd4 {Lenderman isn't the type of player to refuse "free" pawns!} 9. O-O Nxe4 10. Bxe4 Nd7 11. Bf4 Rc8 {White's compensation is obvious. He has more development and the pair of bishops. However Black is rock solid right now and there isn't an easy way to create threats} 12. Rad1 Qf6 13. Rfe1 Nc5 14. Qg3 Qxb2 $6 {The New Yorker is a very brave player!} (14... Be7 {was more sane} 15. Be5 Nxe4 16. Rxe4 Qg6 $44) 15. Bf5 $1 {With the potential threat of sacrificing something on e6!} Qxa2 {That is yet another pawn, but Awonder keeps up the attack} 16. Bd6 Qa5 17. Bxc5 Qxc5 18. Bxe6 {This is the point, White is crashing through} fxe6 19. Rxe6+ Be7 20. Rde1 $6 {not a bad mistake, but an inaccuracy} (20. Re5 $1 Qb4 21. c3 Qa3 22. Qxg7 Rf8 23. Qxh7 {and now there is no threat and with the queen so far away the attack is decisive}) (20. Qxg7 Rf8 {doesn't work as f2 is under attack}) 20... O-O (20... Rf8 21. Rxe7+ Qxe7 22. Rxe7+ Kxe7 23. Qxg7+ {is a bad endgame, but far from easy}) 21. Rxe7 Rf7 {Lenderman is not safe yet} 22. Rxf7 Kxf7 23. Qb3+ $1 Kf8 24. Qe6 $1 { A beautiful regroupoing. With this quiet move, Awonder threatens Re5-f5.} Rd8 25. Re5 Rd1+ 26. Kh2 Qd6 27. Qe8# 1-0
