Nc3 e5 3. g3 Bb4 4. Bg2 O-O 5. e4 Bxc3 6. bxc3 Re8 {Anish had used this move against Mamedyarov at the Qatar Masters 2014 and had won the game. As Giri said in the press conference: I had used this move so it cannot be bad! But I didn't really remember the analysis.} (6... c6 {was played by Anand against Giri.}) 7. d3 c6 8. Nf3 (8. Ne2 {was played by Mamedyarov, but it wasn't a great move.} d5 {Black already was completely fine.}) 8... d5 $1 { At the post game conference Jan Gustaffson asked Aronian a very basic question: "I was taught since childhood that when your opponent has two bishops you shouldn't open the position. Then why does Black play d5 here?" Aronian understood that Jan was asking this question for the benefit of the audience and explained it with the following remark: asssume that the knight is on e2 instead of f3. Now if Black play d6 then White would simply 0-0 and then launch an attack with f4 which would be very strong. Hence opening the position d5 is a necessity and not a luxury. Besides Black is ahead in development and must exploit it.} 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Qc2 Qc7 12. O-O Qxc3 13. Qxc3 Nxc3 14. Bb2 Na4 15. Bxe5 Nc6 {Black has a very comfortable position out of the opening and even though the players played 20 more moves the result of the game was never really in doubt.} 16. Rfe1 Nb6 17. Bc7 Rxe1+ 18.
