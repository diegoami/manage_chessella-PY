Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. Bg5 {Sandipan doesn't usually like to indulge in sharp theoretical lines, but this time chooses the Averbakh Variation of the King's Indian.} c5 7. d5 e6 8. Qd2 exd5 9. cxd5 (9. exd5 {is surely preferable, with the famous game being Magnus Carlsen vs Loek van Wely. But here it has been found that Black can equalize with accurate play.}) 9... Re8 10. f3 a6 11. a4 Qa5 {Somehow White has mixed up his systems and it is no longer so easy to develop his g1 knight.} 12. Ra3 (12. Nd1 $5) 12... Qb4 13. Be3 Nbd7 14. Nh3 Ne5 15. Nf2 Nfd7 16. O-O $2 (16. a5 b5 17. O-O { is somewhere around equal.}) 16... Nb6 $1 {Suddenly Nc4 is a grave threat and White will have to give up both his bishops.} 17. Ra2 Nbc4 18. Qc1 Nxe3 19. Qxe3 Nc4 20. Bxc4 (20. Qc1 Nxb2 $1 $17) 20... Qxc4 {After 20 moves White is in a complete mess. Look at the black bishops, especially the one on g7. It is breathing fire in the position. White has no real breaks and Robby managed to convert this position quite smoothly.} 21. Raa1 Bd7 22. Rfc1 Qb4 23. Qe2 b5 $1 24. a5 Qd4 25. Rd1 Qf6 26. Rd2 Qd8 27. Ncd1 Qc7 28. Ne3 c4 29. g4 Rac8 30. f4 c3 31. bxc3 Bxc3 32. Rc2 Qa7 (32... Bxa1 33. Rxc7 Rxc7 {is also winning. But when you are in a better position there is no need to create a material imbalance.}) 33. Rac1 Bxa5 34. Rxc8 Rxc8 35. Rxc8+ Bxc8 {Black is a pawn up and has two queenside passed pawns.} 36. e5 Bb6 37. Ned1 dxe5 38. fxe5 Qd7 39. Ne3 Bxe3 40. Qxe3 Qxd5 41. Qb6 Bb7 42. Kf1 Qc4+ 43. Ke1 Qc3+ 44. Kf1 Qa1+ 45. Ke2 Qxe5+ 46. Kf1 Bf3 47. h4 Qa1+ {An off day for the Indian grandmaster and a fine win for the young Robby Kevlishvili.} 0-1
