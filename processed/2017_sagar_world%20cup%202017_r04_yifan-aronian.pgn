move. The bishop can be taken, but f2 becomes weak as the rook file is opened
up. This has been seen before in two games.} 16. Nxe6 {[%emt 0:17:44] Hou
Yifan is brave and picks up the challenge.} fxe6 {[%emt 0:01:28]} 17. Rxe6 {
[%emt 0:00:03]} Rxf2 {[%emt 0:00:47] This is obviously very risky and hence
can be assumed that Hou Yifan had prepared it.} 18. Kh1 {[%emt 0:01:33]} Nh4 {

is the other serious option in the position.} 20. Qxh5 Qc7 21. Re5 g6 22. Qg5
Qf7 23. Be3 {It's a crazy line, but essentially White is better objectively.})
20. Qxh4 $2 {[%emt 0:22:51] I would objectively call this a bad move, but
perhaps practically not bad. White is better in this position if she takes on
h6. But it also requires a lot of knowledge and something that Hou Yifan was
perhaps not ready for.} (20. Bxh6 $1 Rxg2 21. Bxd5 cxd5 {The idea now is to
give a check on h2 and get the queen into f2. Hence, it is important to block
the f-file.} 22. Bf4 Qc5 (22... Qf7 23. Rae1 Bf2 24. Qxh4 Bxe1 25. Rxe1 Rxb2

have ended.}) 1/2-1/2
