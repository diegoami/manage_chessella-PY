1. c4 c5 2. b3 $5 {You don't see this opening every day; I don't believe it
even has a name. However, Ramirez is known for his creative style, and in this
game his strategy (if he had one) worked out perfectly.} Nc6 3. g3 e5 4. Bg2 g6

12. Qd2 a6 {White is given a chance to open the black center, and he doesn't
hesitate.} (12... b5 {is more energetic.}) 13. d4 $1 cxd4 14. exd4 e4 $6 {
This loses control of f4, and thus e6 as well.} (14... f4 $1 {Having played f5

16. d5 $1 Ne5 17. Nd4 Bh6 18. Qc3 Qd7 19. f3 $1 {A fantastic idea, opening the
e-file so the Ne5 can be smashed later.} exf3 {Black is basically busted after
this.} ({The best try was} 19... b5) 20. Bxf3 (20. Nxf3 {was a bit more
natural.}) 20... Rfc8 21. Nde6 b5 22. Rae1 bxc4 23. Rxe5 $1 dxe5 24. Qxe5 c3

wanted to preserve his attacking pieces, but} (25. Bxc3 Rxc3 26. Qxc3 Qd6 $18 {
