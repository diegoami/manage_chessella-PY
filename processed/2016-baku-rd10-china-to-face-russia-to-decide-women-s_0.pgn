Andrei Volokitin's score of 7.5/8 on board 4 (he is actually the team's alternate) has been their greatest asset for their great showing so far. In this match, he once more shows how valuable he has been to his team so far.} 1. e4 {(00:00)} c5 {(00:00)} 2. Nf3 { (00:00)} e6 {( 00:00)} 3. d4 {(00:00)} cxd4 {(00:00)} 4.

Babula started well and due to Volokitin's risky move got the upper hand. Had he not missed Bxg5 he might even have obtained a winning position. After falling for the Nd5 tactic, Volokitin played accurately and Babula remained passive. Once can conclude that Volokitin won because he better adjusted himself to the changes that happened to the characteristics of the resulting position after Nd5.} 1-0
