1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 a6 4. g3 b5 5. Bg2 Bb7 6. d3 ({The alternative,} 6.
d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 {is just a different game.}) 6... Nc6 ({Facing the same
problem of how to meet Nf3-g5-h3, I once thought of putting my knight on d7 in
a Closed Sicilian setup, and therefore went} 6... d6 7. Ng5 h6 8. Nh3 g6 9. O-O
Bg7 10. f4 Ne7 11. Ne2 Nd7) 7. O-O d6 8. Ng5 {An amazing invention by GM
Simagin.} h6 9. Nh3 {GM Alex Stripunsky is very fond of this knight
placement, and has scored well with it in American Swisses.} Nf6 10. f4 Be7 {
[#]} 11. f5 {This standard move somehow isn't effective when there's no black
pawn on g6.} ({Sometimes White chooses} 11. Kh1 {to keep his plans hidden.} Qc7
12. Bd2 {is best answered by the standard} O-O ({The experimantal} 12... O-O-O
$6 {didn't work out well for Black in Bacrot-Karjakin, GCT Paris Blitz 2017.})
13. a3 d5 $1 14. exd5 Nd4 {etc.}) 11... b4 $1 {Pushing the white knight away
from the d5-square is important.} ({The stem game Simagin-Portisch, 1959(!)
went} 11... e5 12. Nf2 (12. Nd5 $5) 12... Nd4 13. Nb1 $5 Nd7 14. c3 Nc6 15. a4
Bg5 {with a heavy-duty positional struggle, eventually ending in a draw.}) 12.
Ne2 exf5 13. Rxf5 O-O 14. c4 {This feels wrong, but White's task is already
not so simple.} ({An attempt to bring a knight to control d5,} 14. Nhf4 {
fails to} g6) ({While the prophylactic} 14. Rf1 {allows Black to play} d5)
14... bxc3 15. bxc3 Ne5 16. c4 (16. Rf1 c4 $1 17. d4 Nd3 {is clearly better
for Black.}) 16... Bc8 17. Rf1 Rb8 {Grabbing the b-file before the white rook
can get there. How important can this be? We're about to find out.} 18. Nhf4 $2
{[#] What can be more natural than this? The knight is headed for d5, but
first White would like to bring another knight in by Nc3.} g5 $3 {It turns out
he won't be given any time for that.  Looking it this position it is hard to
imagine White will soon be losing material because of Black's control over the
a1-h8 diagonal. The black bishop isn't even on it, not to mention the two
black knights clogging it up. Yet, Caruana saw it, and his vision came true.}
19. Nd5 {That's what Fabiano counted on.} ({The objectively best} 19. Nh3 {
is a depressing retreat.} Nfg4 20. Qc2 f5 $17) ({Perhaps, some extraordinary
measures had to be taken. What about} 19. Kh1 $5 gxf4 20. gxf4 {White only has
one pawn for a piece, but there may be some attacking chances on the g-file.})
19... Nxd5 20. cxd5 Bf6 {[#] First tactical threat, and surprisingly, Black is
already winning.} 21. d4 (21. Bd2 Nxd3) (21. Be3 Ng4) ({The ugly move} 21. Ba3
{was the most stubborn:} Bg7 22. Qd2 f5 {At least White hasn't lost any
material just yet.}) 21... cxd4 22. Nxd4 Bg4 $1 {Another great rejoinder from
Caruana. The white pieces lose coordination and material losses become
unavoidable.} 23. Qa4 Nd3 (23... Bd7 24. Qd1 Ng4 25. h3 Rb4 {wasn't bad either.
}) 24. Qc4 Rb4 25. Qxd3 Bxd4+ 26. Be3 Bxa1 27. Rxa1 Qf6 28. Re1 Rc8 29. h3 Bd7
30. Qxa6 Rc2 31. Rf1 {What's up with that move g7-g5? First Kramnik crushes
Aronian at the Candidates, then Caruana does the same to Meier at Grenke, and
now this. Can g7-g5 really be that good?} 0-1
