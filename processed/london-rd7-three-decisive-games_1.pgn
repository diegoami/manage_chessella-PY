        having successfully employed it against Grischuk.} 6. Be2 $5 { Anand had 
        played h3 against Topalov, but on his birthday he plays something more 
        classical!} e5 7. Nb3 Be7 8. Be3 Be6 9. Nd5 Nbd7 (9... Nxe4 10. Bb6 $16)

        12. Nd2 $5 {This is Anand's preparation for the game. It has only been 
        played in two games before and GM Vorobiov had used it against Farrukh 
        Amanotov and lost.} ( 12. cxb5 axb5 13. O-O Bxd5 14. exd5 Nb6 15. Bxb6

        with the position he has got. He has a small edge and for sure he is still 
        in his preparation.} Bg5 $1 18. Nf3 Bf4 $1 {A very strong maneuvre by 
        Maxime. By defending his e5 pawn what he is basically trying now is to 
        attack the white centre with f5!} 19. axb5 f5 $1 20. Nd2 Qg5 $6 (20...

        taken on d6 as the b2 pawn would queen. All in all a fine game by Maxime.}
