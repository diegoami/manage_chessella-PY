O-O 9. h3 Bb7 10. d4 Re8 11. Ng5 Rf8 12. Nf3 {An interesting ploy. Perhaps,
exhausted by its length and surely frustrated by the outcome of our game, Bryan
Smith didn't mind a draw to wrap up the tournament.} h6 {The ever-combative
Gareyev emphatically states his desire to play for a win.} 13. Nbd2 Re8 {Now
they're back in the old Smyslov line, where White has the time for an important
knight transfer.} 14. Nf1 $1 {The e4-pawn is safe.} Bf8 15. Ng3 Na5 16. Bc2 Nc4
17. b3 Nb6 18. a4 bxa4 ({For a few games GM Ivan Sokolov experimented with}
18... d5 {which in past was played by old Yugoslav greats Gligoric and Ivkov.
White does get a better game after} 19. Nxe5 dxe4 20. Bf4 ( 20. Qe2 b4 $1)

a novelty, just a rare move.} ({Most people had preferred to trade
light-squared bishops:} 20... Ba6 21. Bxa6 Rxa6 22. Qd3 Ra8 23. Be3 $14) ({An
old classic is Anand-Kamsky, Linares 1991, which saw} 20... Bc6 21. d5 Bd7 22.
Bb5 Bxb5 $2 {Question mark by Anand.} 23. axb5 $16 {In his notes Vishy was
already talking about White's advantage being near decisive.}) 21. d5 Ba6 22.
Bb5 Nfd7 23. Nf5 Bxb5 24. axb5 Nc5 {[#] This is a little sharper version of the
above mentioned game, Black is threatening to undermine the f5-knight, and
counts on developing some counterplay.} 25. Nh2 $5 {Very much Bryan's style. He
values attacking chances against the king above all other positional factors.}
(25. Qc2 a4 26. c4 h5 {preparing to evict the knight by g7-g6.}) 25... Nxe4
{Timur accepts the challenge.} ({Rather than allow White a dangerous build-up
on the kingside after:} 25... a4 26. Qh5 Nd3 27. Ng4) 26. Nxh6+ gxh6 27. Rxe4

here, development is the name of the game.} Qxe4 (37... Rxe4 38. Rg5 $18 ) 38.
Be3 Nc4 39. Bd4 Ne5 $2 {This turns out to be a big time positional concession.}
({Instead, a cool defense} 39... Qg6 40. Bxg7 Kxg7 41. Qd4+ Ne5 42. Rh4 Qd3
{would take the game into a rook ending,} 43. Nxe5 Qxd4+ 44. cxd4 dxe5 45. Rg4+

that.}) 41. Ra4 $1 {A dramatic second rook lift all but seals the deal.} Qg6
