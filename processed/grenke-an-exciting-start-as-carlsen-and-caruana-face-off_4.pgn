hxg6 9. c5 e5 10. b4 {[#]} Be7 {Quite provocative.} ({The inclusion of the
moves} 10... a6 11. a4 {would have protected Black from the immediate attack on
the c6-pawn, but after} Be7 12. b5 O-O 13. bxc6 bxc6 14. Be2 Re8 15. O-O {
White manages to get his king out of the center.}) 11. b5 O-O 12. Qa4 $6 {
That's what Nikita counted on.} Re8 $1 13. bxc6 bxc6 14. Be2 exd4 15. exd4 Nxc5
$1 {The point.} 16. dxc5 d4 17. O-O dxc3 18. Bxc3 Bxc5 19. Bf3 Rc8 20. Bxc6 {
[#] Seemingly Matthias had found a way out, but the activity of the black
pieces leaves White with no time to enjoy his bishop pair.} Re2 $1 21. Bf3 (21.
Be1 {would have been a very sad choice, although White may be able to hold.})

White.}) 26. Qa8 Rc8 27. Qxc8 Qxc8 28. Re1 Qc7 29. g3 Qa7+ 30. Kf3 Qxa2 31. Re2
Qc4 32. Kf2 {and hang in there fighting for a draw. I understand nobody wants a
position like this to come out of the opening with White, but sometimes tough
choices have to be made.}) 25... Ra3 $1 {It is embarrassing to fall victim to a
basic smothered mate pattern, but I hope Matthias doesn't let it bother him too
long. We all blunder, if it's any consolation.} 0-1
