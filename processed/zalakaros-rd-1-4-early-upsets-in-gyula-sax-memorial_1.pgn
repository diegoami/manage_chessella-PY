Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nge7 5. O-O Ng6 {A strange place for the knight.} 6. c3 b5 7. Bb3 Na5 8. Bc2 Be7 9. a4 b4 10. d4 exd4 11. Nxd4 $1 { The classical rule is to capture with the pawn and control the center. However, here White develops the knight to c3 and controls the center better. This also exploits Black's knight on a5.} (11. cxd4 {takes the c3 square away from White's knight, restricting his development possibilities.}) 11... O-O 12. cxb4 Bxb4 13. Nc3 Re8 {White has a healthy advantage, but the position remains very complicated.} 14. f4 $5 (14. Rb1 $1 {was a very strong move} Bxc3 (14... Bb7 15. Nd5 Bf8) 15. bxc3 d5 16. Nf3 $1 $14) (14. Nd5 Bf8 15. Nf5 c6 16. Nde3 d5 $132) 14... Bb7 15. f5 Ne5 16. f6 g6 {This creates a dangerous hook, but concretely, White doesn't have any immediate threat because of Black's dark square bishop.} 17. Nd5 $2 {This completely obseletes the pawn on f6 as White doesn't have a route for the Queen to the dark squares on Black's kingside anymore.} (17. Qd2 Bf8 18. Qg5 $36 {was probably a better try.}) 17... Bxd5 18. exd5 c5 19. Ne2 c4 20. Nc3 Rb8 (20... Nb3 {was very strong!} 21. Bxb3 {forced, as White can't afford to have his dark squared bishop chopped off.} (21. Rb1 Nxc1 22. Rxc1 Qb6+ 23. Kh1 Qe3 $17) 21... cxb3 22. Qd4 Qa5 23. Kh1 Qc5 $17 { White's pawns will be hunted like the men of night's watch will be when the 'other' make their way beyond the wall.}) 21. Kh1 Bf8 (21... Bxc3 22. bxc3 Nb3 {was again very strong, but it's psychologically very hard to exchange off the b4-bishop.} 23. Rb1 Nxc1 24. Rxc1 Rb6 $17) 22. Rb1 Nb3 23. Bf4 Qb6 24. Ne4 Rbc8 25. Ng5 Nc5 26. Qd4 Ned3 {Black is slowly increasing the pressure...} 27. Bxd3 $2 {With three minutes remaining, White throws caution to the wind and goes all in.} (27. Bg3 $142) 27... cxd3 28. Be3 Qb3 29. Qh4 h6 (29... h5 {was also winning.}) 30. Nxf7 Kxf7 31. Bxh6 Re4 32. Bf4 Qxd5 33.
