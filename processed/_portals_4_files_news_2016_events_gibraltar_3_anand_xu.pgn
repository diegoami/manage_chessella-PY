{Chinese players are always under-rated and this 2466 could be much stronger
than his rating. But Anand shows that when he is form such players are no
match for him.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bg5 {
Going for one of the sharpest and most popular line in the Classical - the
Richter Rauzer.} Bd7 7. Qd2 Rc8 8. O-O-O Nxd4 9. Qxd4 Qa5 10. f4 h6 (10... Rxc3
{is the main line.} 11. bxc3 (11. Qxc3 $6 Qxc3 12. bxc3 Nxe4 $44) 11... e5 12.
Qb4 Qxb4 13. cxb4 Nxe4 14. Bh4 {is not scoring so well for White but the
computer is totally in favour of the white pieces here, which is the reason
why Anand must have decided to give this line a go.}) 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Be2 Qc5
13. Qd3 {Any endgame is usually fine for Black whose king will feel
comfortable in the centre. Hence, White preserves the queen.} Bg7 (13... f5 14.
e5 $1 Bg7 15. Rhg1 {With the idea of g4 was seen in Karjakin-Balogh,2005.}) 14.
f5 $1 {Stopping Black from play f5.} h5 15. Kb1 Bh6 16. Rhf1 h4 17. Nd5 Ba4 18.
b3 Bd7 {White has mobilised all his forces and now it is time to play
powerfully. Anand's next move shows that not all conventional wisdoms should
be taken on their face value.} 19. b4 $1 {Wise coaches used to say, "Do not
move your pawns in front of your king!" But Anand figures out that with his
lead in development, this slight weakening poses him absolutely no problems
especially because the rook on h8 is so out of the game.} Qc6 20. Rf3 {The
idea is to play b5 followed by Qb3 and prepare Rc3!} (20. c4 {was equally good.
}) 20... Qa4 21. a3 Kf8 22. c4 Qc6 23. Rh3 {The rook could the other way as
well!} Bg5 24. g3 {Suddenly the king on f8 begins to start feeling the heat.}
e6 {Black gets impatient and tries to break free. But in fact just falls
deeper into the hole.} 25. gxh4 $1 Bxh4 (25... exd5 26. hxg5 $1 Rxh3 27. Qxh3
$18) 26. Nc3 (26. Rxh4 $1 {was a nice shot.} Rxh4 27. Nxf6 {With a crushing
advantage as nasty things like Qg3 and Rg1 are threatened.}) 26... Ke7 $6 (
26... Qb6 {was better stopping Nb5.}) 27. Nb5 Bf2 28. Nxd6 $1 Rcd8 29. Nxf7 $1
{These sacrifices are just child's play for Anand to calculate.} Rxh3 (29...
Kxf7 30. Rxh8 Rxh8 31. Qxd7+ $18) 30. Nxd8 {A clean victory for the Indian
maestro.} (30. Nxd8 Rxd3 31. Nxc6+ $18) 1-0
