Nxd2 9. Qxd2 a5 10. a3 Bxc3 11. Nxc3 a4 {[#]} 12. Nxa4 $5 {If this really is
good, then I vote we call this the Barbary Macaque's Posterior variation.
White usually develops his bishop to d3 or maybe b5. Interestingly, White
thought for around 35 minutes about this, so maybe he invented it at the board.
Or wanted his opponent to think that.} Rxa4 {Ivanchuk didn't take long to do
this since he's little choice anyway.} 13. Bb5+ Bd7 14. Bxa4 Bxa4 15. Qb4 Qd7
16. O-O Qb5 $6 ({I find it difficult to understand why Black didn't just get
on with his development and play} 16... O-O {here. It's far from clear what
White has after that. Was Ivanchuk worried about a snap attack on his king,
should it come to g8, with a rook lift or two, a queen relocation to the
kingside and a swift g4-pawn advance, say? Looks far-fetched to me.}) 17. b3
Qxb4 18. axb4 Bb5 19. Ra7 $1 {Sandipan gives up more material to grab the
initiative with this rook.} Bxf1 20. Rxb7 Nc6 21. Kxf1 {[#]} O-O $2 ({This
game may become known as Ivanchuk's great castling fiasco. When he should have
castled, he didn't, and now he shouldn't, he does. Admittedly, the right move
as prescribed by the engines is not at all intuitive, but on his best form I
would have backed an imaginative player of Ivanchuk's quality to have found it:
} 21... Rf8 $1 {After this Black should hold. It enables him to move his king
towards the rook without having to worry about checks on the back rank (after
the knight moves), thus keeping the king in touch with the coming pawn
advances.}) 22. b5 $1 Na5 ({After} 22... Nxd4 23. c6 {White simply advances c7
and Rb8 and it is all over. Any attempt to blockade on c8 will be refuted by
the advance of the b-pawn.}) 23. Rc7 $1 (23. Rc7 Rb8 (23... Nxb3 24. b6 Na5 25.
c6 {followed by b7 and Rc8 wins}) 24. b4 Nb7 25. Rd7 {wins comfortably.}) 1-0
