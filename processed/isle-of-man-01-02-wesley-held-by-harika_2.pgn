        a great attacking player Shirov is. But the positional style in which 
        he defeats Trent in this game is worth learning from!} Bxe3 $1 {We are 
        usually said not to give up our bishop for a knight just like that. But 
        here Shirov does it with a clear intention. The pawns are on dark squares 
        and the bishop would not be a great piece. The evaluation of the position 
        doesn't change. It is still equal. But as IM Jeremy Silman says, "You 
        must first create an imbalance and then nurture it in the right way in 
        order to win."} 19. Bxe3 Qd7 20. a4 (20. d5 {I was wondering if this move, 
        in order to activate the bishop is good. Turns out that the d5 pawn would 
        just become a weakness.} Rae8 21. Qd2 Re5 $15) 20... d5 {The bishop on 
        e3 slowly but steadily starts to feel as if it is a big pawn!} 21. axb5

        29. Re1 Qf6 30. Rxe8 Kxe8 {We now come to the famous Capablanca's theorem. 
        A knight and queen in the endgame are superior to a bishop and queen. 
        The reason is simple: the queen cannot move like a knight, so their roles 
        are always different, while a queen can move like a bishop so they are 
        always stepping onto each other's plans.} 31. Kf2 Kf7 32. g4 f4 $1 {Closing 
        the bishop.} 33. Bc1 b4 $1 34. Bd2 b3 $1 {Now the b-pawn is just two squares 
        away from queening. It is beautiful to see how slowly but steadily Shirov 
        is turning the imbalances in the position to his advantage.} 35. Bc1 Kg8 
        36. Bd2 Kh7 {Getting the king to safety so that the queen can now go on 
        some better journeys!} 37. Qf5 $2 Qh4+ 38. Ke2 (38. Kg2 Qg3+ $19) 38... 
        Qxh3 {That's just a free pawn!} 39. Be1 (39. Bxf4 Qg2+ $19) 39... h5 $1 
        {A very nice decision. Shirov sees that going into the minor piece endgame 
        is the easiest way to win.} 40. Qxh5+ Qxh5 41. gxh5 Nf8 42. Kd3 Ne6 43.

        game by Shirov. At the same time we learn that doing nothing against this 
        strong guys is more often than not a recipe for disaster!} 0-1
