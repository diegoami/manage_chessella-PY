1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Qb6 $5 {Some readers may recall this
line from my notes to Sevian-Yermolinsky, Spice Cup 2017. This time I'll skip
the opening theory until we get to a critical juncture.} 5. Nb3 Nf6 6. Nc3 e6
7. Qe2 Bb4 8. Bd2 O-O 9. a3 Be7 10. Be3 Qc7 11. f4 d5 12. e5 Nd7 {[#]} 13. Nb5
{Bezgodov follows the official recommendation.} ({Sam Sevian tried the very
interesting} 13. Qg4 {intended to fight against f7-f6.}) 13... Qb8 14. c4 (14.
O-O-O f6 $1) 14... dxc4 15. Qxc4 {The position of the white queen is designed
to have the same effect - the e6-pawn is kept under observation. However, it
failed to make an impression on Gata Kamsky, who played the much-needed break
anyway. That's the strategy I recommended. I secretly hope Gata read my article
on the Spice Cup, saw that game I mentioned above, and decided to follow the
suggestion.} a6 16. Nc3 f6 $5 {[#] Seemingly White is adequately developed to
punish Black for his insurgency, but his position is slightly loose with that
pawn on f4, while the b3-knight, is... well, as Dr.Tarrasch said, always stands
badly.} 17. O-O-O {An interesting concept, somewhat reminiscent of the Kasparov
line 5.Nxc6 bc6 6.e5 of the Scotch defense. White sacrifices a central pawn to
facilitate the pressure on Black's undeveloped Q-side. In this case, the shaky
position of the white king becomes the deciding factor.} ({White can ill afford
to spend time on material gains, as} 17. Qxe6+ Kh8 {leaves him struggling to
find a decent move in the face of the threat of Ndxe5.}) ({Best was} 17. exf6
Nxf6 18. Be2 Kh8 19. O-O e5 20. Rae1 {where White fights on even terms.}) 17...
Kh8 18. g3 fxe5 19. Bg2 exf4 20. Bxf4 e5 21. Be3 Nf6 22. Rhf1 e4 $1 {[#]
Textbook play. Gata needed that Bg4 move to gain a tempo for his rook coming to
c8.} ({Not the immediate} 22... Bg4 $2 23. Rxf6 $1) 23. Bf4 (23. Nxe4 Bg4 24.
Rde1 Rc8 {is already big trouble for White.} ) 23... Qa7 24. Rde1 Bd7 25. Kb1
b5 26. Qe2 b4 {Black insists on giving away his extra pawn.} 27. Nxe4 bxa3 28.
Be3 Qb8 {It's surprising how little White gets out of his tempo moves that keep
on hitting the black queen, apparently to no particular effect.} 29. Nec5 Bg4
30. Qd2 Rd8 31. Qc3 Nd5 $19 32. Bxd5 Rxd5 33. Na4 Qb5 34. Rf7 Bf5+ 35. Ka1 Re5
36. Nb6 Rd8 37. Rc1 Be6 38. Rxe7 Nxe7 {A very easy win for Kamsky. Who said the
Sicilian is dead?} 0-1
