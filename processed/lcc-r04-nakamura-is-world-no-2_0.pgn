Nakamura once again got the better of Anand in the Catalan - he had achieved the same result in the same opening at the Sinquefield Cup 2015.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 d5 4. g3 Be7 5. Bg2 O-O 6. Qc2 $5 {This move has been played in 1400 games before, but it's popularity is nothing compared to 6.0-0 which has been played in 14,000 games! Qc2 is played so as to avoid the most popular dxc4 followed by a6-b5 setup in the Catalan.} c5 {The most principled approach. The king is in the centre so Anand tries to open the position as quickly as he can.} 7. O-O cxd4 8. Nxd4 Qb6 (8... Nc6 {is the main move.}) 9. Rd1 Nc6 10. Nxc6 Qxc6 11. Bg5 $146 {Nakamura finds a novelty in a position where moves like Na3, b3 and a4 have been played before.} h6 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Na3 Bd7 14. Rab1 (14. cxd5 Qxc2 15. Nxc2 Ba4 $15 {leads to an excellent position for Black.}) 14... Rac8 15. Qd3 Rfd8 16. cxd5 Qa4 17. Rd2 (17. dxe6 Bxe6 18. Qf3 Rxd1+ $19) 17... b5 {Until now everything was Nakamura's preparation. 17...b5 was a move that he had not seen at home.} ( 17... Bg5 $5 18. e3 exd5 19. h4 (19. Bxd5 Be6 $19) (19. Qxd5 Bc6 $11) 19... Bf6 20. Bxd5 {Now Be6 or c6 can be met with e4. Nakamura had analysed this position at home and had realized how useful the move h4 was. Hence, he played that move in the game as well.}) 18. Rbd1 exd5 $6 19. Bxd5 {Now White can defend the bishop on d5 with his pawn on e4 and simply be a pawn up. Of course Black has some compensation, but it doesn't seem to be enough.} Bc6 (19... b4 20. Nc4 $16) 20. e4 a6 21. h4 $5 {This move was based on the note to Black's 17th move.} Bxd5 22. exd5 Qb4 23. Rb1 Qa5 24. b4 Qa4 25. Rb3 Be7 26. Re2 $1 { As Nakamura described it in the press conference: this is a study like continuation.} Rc7 (26... Bxb4 {Black could have snatched a pawn and suffered!} 27. Re4 a5 28. Kg2 $16 {[%csl Ga3,Ra4,Ga5,Gb3,Gb4,Gb5]}) 27. Kg2 Bf6 28. Qf3 Re7 29. Rd2 Red7 30. Qe2 g6 $6 31. h5 $1 {Gaining more space and further weakening Black's structure.} g5 32. Qd1 Bg7 33. Nc2 $1 Qxa2 34. Ne3 $18 { Once the knight gets to e3 it becomes very easy to win the game.} Qa1 (34... Qa4 35. Qb1 {[%cal Gd2a2]} Qa1 36. Qxa1 Bxa1 $18 {transposes to the game.}) 35. Qxa1 Bxa1 36. Ra2 Bd4 37. Nf5 Bg7 38. Rxa6 Bf8 39. d6 Bxd6 40. Nxh6+ Kh7 41. Ng4 $18 {An excellent positional game by Nakamura, who kept great control and has increased his lead to 7:1 in classical games against Vishy Anand.} 1-0
