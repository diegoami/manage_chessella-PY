Ne3 Nd4 {The position is roughly equal, according to the computers, but I prefer Black a bit. The pressure on the c-file is annoying and White's bishop on g2 does not have a bright future. Resources exist in all kinds of positions, and White finds a devilish trap. Talking to Yuniesky after the game he said that Jeffery is a great calculator, and there is no way that he missed 20.a3, but he just didn't see anything against it.} 20. a3 $2 {This seems clever, but it backfires.} (20. Rfe1 Qb5 (20... g6 $11) 21. Qxb5 Rxb5 $13) 20... Qb5 $1 {Black's counoter point } (20... Qxa3 21. Ra1 Qb2 22. Rfb1 {is White's point. The queen is trapped.}) 21. Qxb5 axb5 {White has no time to take on b4 because of Ne2+} 22. Ra1 bxa3 23. Rxa3 {Now Black can pick off the c2 pawn whenever he wants. Jeffery converts easily} Bg5 24. c4 h6 25. h4 Bxe3 26.
