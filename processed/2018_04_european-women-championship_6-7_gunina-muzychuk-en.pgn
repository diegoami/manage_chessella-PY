O-O a4 16. Bc2 Be6 17. Rad1 {Gunina allowed her dark-squared bishop to be exchanged and set up a modest centre with c3 and d3.
However, the white position has one great advantage: all pieces are on their
best squares. She's already managed the time-consuming knight route b1-d2-f1-e3. No wonder that after the last move
she threatens to break through with d4. Therefore Muzychuk cannot maintain the tension in the center. My feeling is the Ukrainian
Ex-world champion has already gone a bit wrong. Her pieces are discoordinated after the transformation of the pawn structure that follows.} dxe4

[%csl Re7,Rf6][%cal Re7d5,Re7f5,Rf6e5] The white pawn structure on the

the dominance of the white knight against the black bishop is. Though
the bishop has now broken out of its prison on f6, even on the outside it's not much use.} 35. Ne3 $16
