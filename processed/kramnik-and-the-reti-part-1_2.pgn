1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 c6 4. O-O Bg4 {A solid system of development,
favored by career Slav Defense players. Kramnik himself employed it many times.
} 5. d3 ({The author of these notes has a particular affinity for} 5. c4 $5 e6
6. cxd5 {This early pawn trade has its points, but Black may reply in a
classical fashion} Bxf3 (6... exd5 {is what White is playing for, however
unclear the resulting positions might be.}) 7. Bxf3 cxd5 8. Nc3 Nc6 9. d4 ({ I
haven't had much success with} 9. d3) 9... Be7 10. e3 {with a tiny plus for
White, who relies on his bishop pair - see Karjakin-Vitiugov, 2014 and
Karjakin-Eljanov, 2015}) 5... Nbd7 6. h3 $5 {Kramnik likes to see what Black
plans to do with his bishop, before deciding on the direction of his own play.}
({Perhaps, it's a bit late for} 6. c4 {on account of} Bxf3 7. Bxf3 dxc4 8. dxc4
Ne5 {although} 9. Qb3 Nxf3+ 10. Qxf3 g6 11. Nc3 Bg7 12. Rd1 Qc8 13. Bf4 {
brought White success in Nepomniatchi-Harikrishna, 2014}) 6... Bh5 7. Qe1 $1 {
Very subtle play. White is no hurry to develop his other knight. We'll see why.
} e5 8. e4 dxe4 9. dxe4 Bc5 10. a4 $1 {[#]} O-O (10... a5 {seems logical to put
a stop to White's expansion on the Q-side.} 11. Nbd2 O-O 12. Nc4 Qc7 (12... Bb4
$5 13. c3 Bxf3 14. Bxf3) 13. Bd2 b6 {White has been able to provoke a small,
but not insignificant weakening in Black's camp. Now if Bg2 ever gets opened
(Nf5 Bxf5 exf5 for instance) the pawn on c6 will come under attack.} 14. Nh4
Rfe8 15. Kh1 Bg6 (15... Nf8 16. f4 {Vaganian-Mueller, 1996} exf4 17. Bxf4 $14)

13. b4 $1 Be7 14. Nf5 Ne6 {[#]} 15. Nxe7+ $3 {Reminiscent of the famous "good
knight for bad bishop" exchange from the Fischer-Taimanov game.} Qxe7 16. Be3
Bg6 17. f3 {[#] The last move is modest, but it serves the important purpose of
securing White's advantage, as Black's Bg6 and Nf6 are out of work.} Nd7 (17...
a5 18. b5 Nd4 {seems a reasonable try, but it hardly brings dividends after}

{Understandably, MVL seeks counterplay.} 19. Rd1 f4 (19... fxe4 20. fxe4 Nd4
21. Bxd4 exd4 22. Rxd4 Ne5 {is not a very pleasant choice, but it would have
taken some effort on Kramnik's part to convert his extra pawn.}) 20. Rxd7 $3 {A
smashing shot!} Qxd7 21. Nxe5 Qc7 22. gxf4 Nxf4 $5 (22... a5 23. Qg3 Nf8 24.
