{Here I started to feel that I might be worse due to the pressure on the e5
pawn and the threat Rde1 and If I go Rfe8 White can follow with Nd4 due to the
pin on the e-file.} {[%tqu "Find the best way to neutralise white's
intiative.","","",f6,"After some calculations I realised that the threats along
the a2-g8 diagonal weren't so dangerous.",10]} 22... f6 $1 {After some
calculations I realised that the threats along the a2-g8 diagonal weren't so
dangerous.} (22... Kh8 $5 {was the safer way but I decided to have faith on my
calculations and play f6.}) 23. d6 {Tempting but maybe not the best.} (23. c5
bxc5 24. d6+ Rf7 $5 25. dxc7 Rc8 {Black is slightly better.}) 23... cxd6 24.
Qxb6 Qc8 $1 {A nice retreat which I liked. The queen keeps the queenside pawns
under protection while also c4 is not so easy to defend without making
concessions.} (24... Rb8 $5 {was also interesting.} 25. Qxa6 Rxb2 $15) 25. Nd2
({Safer was} 25. Qb3 Nf4 $15 {with a strong position for Black.}) 25... Nf4 {
[%cal Gc8a8] After this I was sure that Black was already taking over the
intiative.} 26. Rae1 Qa8 27. Rg3 Rb8 28. Qe3 $6 ({Better was} 28. Qxd6 { but
still Black is clearly better after} Rxb2 $5 (28... Rbd8 29. Qb4 Nd3 $17) (

converted easily.} 0-1
