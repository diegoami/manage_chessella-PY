WIth seven in seven, you cannot ask for more than that!} 1. e4 {(00:00)} c5 {(00:00)} 2. Nf3 {(00:00)} Nc6 {(00:00)} 3. d4 {(00:00)} cxd4 {(00:00)} 4. Nxd4 {( 00:00)} Nf6 {(00:00)} 5. Nc3 {(00:04)} e5 {(00:00) Hracek is a veteran GM with years of experience at the highest level. He always plays 'healthy' openings with a good grasp of middlegame nuances. His opening choice today is a Sveshnikov!} 6. Ndb5 {(00:20)} d6 {(00:06)} 7. Bg5 {(00:21)} a6 {( 00:07)} 8. Na3 {(00:07)} b5 {(00:04)} 9.

Qd3 $146 {(07:34) This move seems very natural but it is a novelty! We may not be surprised to see a novelty on move 16 in a Berlin, Spanish or even a French Defence, however, it is rare to see a novelty in the Sveshnikov this early!} (16. b3 Bxd5 17. cxd5 Nd4 18.

Nce3 $6 {(00:08) Very very dubious!} bxa2 $2 {(08:09) a weak reaction from Hracek. He had to go "all in" in this position. It may not be something he likes but it is what the position calls for.} (17... a3 $1 18. Qxb3 (18. axb3 axb2 19. Rb1 Bxh3 20. Rxh3 Ra1 21. Rh1 Qa5+ 22. Kf1 Rxb1+ 23. Qxb1 Qa3 24. Qd1 Rb8 25.

Rxb7 {(00:05)} Qg4 {(01:20) After the 6th round game between L'Ami-Adhiban this is the second time I am commenting on opposite colored bishops in a position concerning attack and defence! Since White has a strong attack over the f7 square and Black's dark-squared bishop is helpless to defend f7, it is as if White is a piece up in his attack. If you want to know who said that for the first time, I encourage you to read our Round 6 report!} 34. Qa2 $18 {(03:31) White's attack is unstoppable.} Bxh4 {(02:13) equivalent to a resignation.} 35.

Qf7 {(01:53) Hracek reaction to Nepo's dubious novelty was slow and inactive. Nepo did all he had to do, activated his bishop, placed his rooks on the right squares and seized the seventh rank. He simply asked Hracek a number of difficult questions in this game and unfortunately for the Czechs and Hracek, he failed to answer them.} 1-0
