Rab8 18. a4 {An interesting situation. Black has the "pair of knights" against the pair of bishops, but he has decent chances because of the weakness on c4 and c3. If The game opens up, somehow, White will be better beyond doubt. } Nc4 19. Be1 Rfc8 20. Qa2 b6 21. Rb4 Qc6 22. Rab1 (22. Bxc4 dxc4 {doesn't help White as there would be a good anchor spot for the knight on d5.}) 22... Ne8 23. Bxc4 dxc4 24. f3 $6 {Perhaps feeling the pressure. This pawn sacrifice is dubious, with the idea of opening the bishop.} exf3 25. Bg3 Rb7 26. Be5 Re7 27. a5 bxa5 {Black simply takes all the pawns that come his way! White has some compensation, but two pawns are two pawns.} 28. Rb5 (28. Qxa5 fxg2 $17) 28... Qg6 29. Rxa5 Qd3 $1 {Making the queen very active and causing real headaches.} 30. Ra3 $6 (30. Bf4 $17) 30... f6 31. Bf4 g5 {Now it is simply over.} 32. Bg3 Rxe3 {Black has a decisive attack and is up two pawns.} 33. Re1 Re2 34. Rxe2 fxe2 35. Bf2 Qd1+ 36. Kh2 Qf1 37. Bg3 e1=Q 38. Bxe1 Qxe1 {Simple, Black is now up a piece and White has nothing to show for it.} 39. Rxa7 Qe6 40. Qb1 Rc7 41. Ra8 Re7 42. Qb4 Kg7 43. Rd8 Qe3 0-1
