O-O 9. O-O-O d5 10. Qe1 $5 {This special way of fighting the Dragon was
introduced by the future grandmaster Semen Dvoirys in 1987.} e5 ({A particular
problem with} 10... e6 11. h4 Qc7 {is} 12. Ndb5 $1 {.}) 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. exd5
Nxd5 $1 ({After} 12... cxd5 13. Bg5 $1 Be6 14. Bc4 $1 {(the key idea of
Dvoirys: White attacks Black's seemingly strong pawn centre)} Qc7 {(which,
amonst others, was once played with Black by Carlsen - in a 2008 rapid game
against Leko) most unpleasant for Black is probably} 15. Bxd5 $1 Nxd5 16. Nxd5
{.}) 13. Bc4 Be6 14. Kb1 {The most topical move, which only recently started
to appear at GM level.} ({Before that, Dvoirys' original} 14. Ne4 {and then}
Qc7 15. Bc5 Rfd8 {, etc. etc. for many years remained to be the main line. 
(For more about all this historical stuff, see my book "Understanding the
Sicilian"). The waiting 14.Kb1 is almost as unobvious as the whole Qe1 idea,
but it's liked by engines. Now the exchange on c3 leads to a strategically
better position for White; after 14...Qc7 White captures on d5, winning the
pawn. And other Black's moves are, presumably (!?), less useful for him than
Kb1 for White. Quite a clever concept, in other words.}) 14... Re8 ({This is
not new, but until now more attention was given to} 14... Rb8 {and if} 15. Ne4
f5 {which Jones playes several times and also analysed in his massive
"Grandmaster Repertoire" book} ({after} 15... Qc7 16. Bc5 Rfd8 {,} 17. g4 h6

Qf4+ $19 {in Bakhmatsky-Golubev, Lviv rapid 2017, but insertion of 21.gxf5!
makes things different, and generally White can be better in this branch with .
..Qc7 where he has various options}) {. Still, Black can have some problems
after} 16. Bxa7 $5 ({instead of} 16. Ng5 Bc8 17. h4 {, faced by Jones at least
twice}) 16... Qe7 17. Bc5 Qb7 18. Bb3 fxe4 19. Bxf8 Rxf8 20. fxe4 Nf4 {and now
a move, discussed on the Chesspublishing website,} 21. Qc3 $1 {.}) 15. Ne4 $1 (
{Black is OK after} 15. h4 Qc7 $1 16. Nxd5 cxd5 17. Bxd5 Bxd5 18. Rxd5 e4 {,
Navara-Edouard, French ChT Drancy 2016.}) 15... f5 $1 16. Ng5 $1 Bc8 $1 ({As
contrary to the game, after} 16... a5 $6 {,} 17. g4 $5 {is already quite good.
So I suspected that Magnus just mixed up things which he surely must have
prepared before the game. But instead, he just says in the official
after-the-game video that he was not expecting the Dragon. Perhaps, he is just
lazy... somewhat.}) 17. g4 $4 {A terrible, terrible blunder.} ({Most critical
seems to be} 17. h4 {where Black has to make choice between several options.
Perhaps, I'm rooting for} Rb8 $5 ({after} 17... h6 18. Ne4 $1 {Black has a
choice again, but I am not sure that I like anything for him here: in
particular, annoying is that after} Be6 $6 {quite strong can be} 19. Bb3 $1 Qc7
20. Nc5 $1 Bf7 21. g4 $1 {, etc.}) ({another move is} 17... a5 {where} 18. h5
$5 f4 19. Bxf4 exf4 20. Rxd5 $3 cxd5 21. Bxd5+ Qxd5 22. Qxe8+ Bf8 23. Nxh7 $1 {
is possibly not strongest for White but deserves to be mentioned anyway}) 18.
Bb3 ({or, alternatively,} 18. Bxa7 Rb7 {and if} 19. Bc5 e4 $1 20. Bb3 h6 21.
Nh3 exf3 {, etc.}) 18... h6 $1 ({avoiding} 18... a5 $6 19. c4) 19. Ne4 ({or} 
19. c4 Rxb3 20. axb3 hxg5) 19... Qc7 {and so on.}) ({One more idea is} 17. Bb3
$5 f4 18. h4 ({Black should be able to survive also} 18. Ne4 fxe3 19. c4 Be6 $1
20. cxd5 cxd5 21. Qxe3 $11) 18... fxe3 19. c4 e4 $5 20. cxd5 Qf6 {and White
has an easy draw, for example,} 21. dxc6+ Kh8 22. Nf7+ Kg8 23. Ng5+ {(where
Black should avoid} Be6 $2 24. Bxe6+ Rxe6 25. Qb4 $1 $18 {) but probably no
more. Hopefully, Black is OK everywhere. But before entering all these lines
in a practical game, the safest is to check them with AlphaZero. One way or
another, one can see how dangerous is to play the Dragon these days, if your
opponent isn't a lazy world champ but someone who is well prepared.}) 17... f4
$1 $19 {Now White simply loses a minor piece.} 18. h4 ({After} 18. Bf2 Qxg5 19.
Bh4 {,} Qh6 {is a forced temporary retreat. White has nothing for a bishop and
is completely lost.} 20. Rxd5 cxd5 21. Bxd5+ Be6 {does not help at all.}) 18...
fxe3 19. Qxe3 h6 20. Qc5 Bb7 21. Ne4 $19 {White has only a pawn for the bishop
and, generally, a resignable position. What happened next, surely has more to
do with psychology than with chess as such. A world class player, Jones,
started to play wrongly on almost every move.} Re6 $6 22. h5 $5 Qb6 $6 ({22...
g5 or first} 22... Bf8 $5 {was still quite good.}) 23. g5 $1 hxg5 $2 ({After} 
23... Rb8) ({or} 23... Bf8 {Black would have remained a stronger side.}) 24.
Qa3 $1 {And White has full compensation for the piece already.} Rb8 25. b3 $5 (
{This calm move, praised by GM Rowson in Twitter, forces Black to make harder
decisions than the line} 25. Nxg5 Bf8 26. Qd3 Ba6 27. b3 Bxc4 28. Qxc4 {.})
25... Qd8 $6 26. Qxa7 $1 {And this unpleasant capture provoked Black's final
mistake on the next move. It's difficult to fight against an opponent who
blunders a piece like a beginner and then begins to play like a genius.} gxh5
$4 27. Rxh5 Rg6 28. Rxg5 $1 Rxg5 29. Nxg5 $18 {It's not immediately obvious
but Black's pieces are cooperating poorly and White's activity decides.} Qc8
