Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. d4 Bg7 5. Be2 O-O 6. Be3 (6. Nf3 {has been analyzed ad infinitum, while I've seen 6.Bg5 get some popularity.}) 6... e5 7. d5 Na6 8. g4 {White puts a break on f5 before it's even a threat. A relatively positional approach to the position (White almost never tries to checkmate black on the kingside), and one that is certainly dangerous, even if relatively untried with this particular move order.} c6 (8... Nc5 {is probably better, simply to force f3 out of White first.}) 9. g5 Ne8 10. h4 f5 $5 11. gxf6 Nxf6 12. h5 {When I said White usually doesn't try to checkmate Black on the kingside, I didn't mean never. Since Black has committed to f5 and weakened some of his squares, Sokolov sees an opportuinty to launch his pawns forward. There are still no immediate threats in the center. Notice how it would favor Black if the pawn on f2 was on f3.} Qa5 13. hxg6 (13. Qd2 Nxh5 { is very far from clear, but playable.} (13... cxd5 $1 14. cxd5 Nxh5 {might be an improvement, to guarantee that the knight on c3 never recaptures on d5.})) 13... Nxe4 $1 {Brave but smart. Here if Van Foreest doesn't take on e4, he will be doomed to passivity.} (13... hxg6 14. Qd2 {with a large initiative.}) 14. gxh7+ Kh8 15. Nf3 $1 {Development above all!} Nxc3 16. bxc3 cxd5 17. Kf1 ( 17. cxd5 {is simply a waste of time:} Qxc3+ (17... Bf5 $5) 18. Kf1 Bf5 19. Nh4 Bc2 {and Black has counterplay.}) 17... Bf5 18. Nh4 dxc4 (18... Nc7 $5 19. Bd3 $1 (19. Bg4 Be4 {is the resource that the computer is trying to avoid.}) 19... e4 20. Be2 $1 {is a brilliant and computer-esque maneuver. The threat will be Bd4 or Bg4.}) (18... d4 19. cxd4 exd4 20. Bxd4 Bxd4 21. Qxd4+ Qe5 $16) 19. Bxc4 {is very bad for Black. Positionally he is busted in some endgames:} Rac8 $6 ( 19... Rad8 20. Nxf5 Rxf5 21. Qg4 $1) (19... d5 20. Nxf5 Rxf5 21. Qxd5 $18) 20. Be6 {The bishop is untouchable and the game is over.} Be4 21. Qg4 Bd3+ 22. Kg1 {White has way too many threats now} Rce8 23. Bf5 (23. Rd1 {was also clean.}) 23... Bxf5 24. Qxf5 $1 Rf6 (24... Rxf5 25. Ng6# {is unplayable, of course.}) 25. Bg5 {Salt in the wound.} Rfe6 26. Ng6+ Rxg6 27. Qxg6 Rf8 28. Be7 {White has a material advantage and a deadly attack.} Rxf2 1-0
