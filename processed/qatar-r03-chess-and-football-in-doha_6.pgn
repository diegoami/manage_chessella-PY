Bb5 Rac8 22. Ba6 Rb8 23. Bb5 f6 {The reason why I would like to show you this
game is because simply unbelievable things start happening from this point
onwards, right until the end of the game.} 24. Qf4 $5 {A bold decision
accepting the tripled pawns.} (24. Qe3 $16 {[%cal Ge2f4] was objectively
stronger and would have retained the advantage for White but this is nowhere
nearly as creative as what was played in the game.}) 24... Qxf4 25. gxf4 $5 {
[%csl Gf2,Gf3,Gf4] The tripled pawns looks hideous, but the c-file is beckoning
the white rooks.} Nd8 26. Rc7 Kf8 27. Rd7 Rh7 (27... Nf5 28. Rcc7 Nxh4+ 29. Kh3
Nf5 30. Bd3 Ke8 31. Bxf5 gxf5 32. Rg7 $16 {is a horrible position for Black.
None of his pieces are playing and the white rooks wreak havoc on the seventh
rank.}) 28. f5 $1 Rf7 $1 {Great defensive move found by the world female number
one.} (28... exf5 29. Nf4 $18) (28... gxf5 29. Nf4 $18) 29. fxg6 Nxg6 30. Rcc7
Nxh4+ 31. Kh3 Nxf3 32. Kg3 Ng5 {Black is two pawns up, but wait, dear folks,
this is just the beginning.} 33. Nf4 {The knight comes in threatening to take
back one pawn with Nxh5.} h4+ 34. Kxh4 Nf3+ 35. Kh5 { The king now joins the
attack.} Nxd4 {Another important pawn bites the dust and the b5 bishop is
hanging.} 36. Kg6 {But who cares!} Rxd7 37. Rxd7 Nxb5 { Black is not only two
pawns up but now has an extra piece as well.} 38. Kxf6 $1 {Ng6 followed by Re7
or Rg7 is a deadly threat. And imagine having absolutely no time as we are
nearing the 40th move.} Nc6 39. Nxe6+ Ke8 (39... Kg8 40. Rg7+ Kh8 41. Ng5 Nd8
(41... Rf8+ 42. Nf7+ Rxf7+ 43. Rxf7 $14) 42. Rh7+ Kg8 43. Rg7+ $11) 40. Rxd5
{The knight on b5 surprisingly lacks good squares to go to!} Rb7 $6 ({It was
time to take a draw and go back home!} 40... Nba7 41. Nc7+ Kf8 42. Ne6+ Ke8 43.
Nc7+ Kf8 44. Ne6+ Kg8 45. Rg5+ Kh8 46. Rh5+ Kg8 47. Rg5+ $11 { [%csl
Ge6,Gf6,Gg5] The black king alone cannot escape the trio of white king, rook
and knight.}) 41. Rxb5 Rf7+ 42. Kg5 Rxf2 43. Rxb6 {White is the one who can
press now, as he is pawn up. But this is very drawish.} Ne5 44. b3 Kd7 45. Nc5+
Kc7 46. Re6 Nc6 47. Re3 {The players agreed to a draw. I think it was a piece
of brilliant attack and defence by both sides, especially from the white
player.} 1/2-1/2
