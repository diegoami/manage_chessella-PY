1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 c6 4. e4 dxe4 5. Nxe4 {[#]} c5 {An interesting manifestation of Kramnik's creativity! This has never been played at this level, and Kramnik described it as "a bad move", but it turns out to be quite playable!} (5... Bb4+ $11 {would be a normal move here.}) 6. Nxc5 Nc6 {The next original follow up.}
7. Nf3 {Here Caruana invested a good chunk of time, and opted for one
of the safer variantions.} (7. Nb3 {was just one of several alternatives.}) 7...
Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Qxd4 9. Nxd4 Bxc5 10. Nb5 Ke7 {[#] Kramnik was well aware of this position from his home preparation.} 11. Bd2 (11. Nc7 {was possible, e.g.}

17. Rac1 Nf5 18. Bc3 f6 19. f4 h5 20. Bc6 Rcd8 21. a4 h4 {[#] Kramnik tries
to get something out of his majority on the kingside, but it doesn't amount to much. In the end, his small structural advantage is balanced by Caruana's bishop pair.} 22. Kf3 hxg3 23. hxg3 Rxh1 24. Rxh1 Bb8 25. Be4 Kf7 26.
