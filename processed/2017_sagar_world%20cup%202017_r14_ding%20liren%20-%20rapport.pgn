{One of the biggest mistakes, according to me, made by Rapport is that he
didn't play for a win or even put the slightest of pressure on Ding Liren with
the white pieces. Now Ding had the white pieces and he wasn't going to take it
easy!} 1. d4 {[%emt 0:00:00]} Nf6 {[%emt 0:00:40]} 2. c4 {[%emt 0:01:19]} e6 {
[%emt 0:00:07]} 3. Nf3 {[%emt 0:00:19]} b6 {[%emt 0:00:13]} 4. g3 {[%emt 0:00:
06]} Bb7 {[%emt 0:00:05]} 5. Bg2 {[%emt 0:00:05]} Be7 {[%emt 0:00:16]} 6. O-O {
[%emt 0:00:07]} O-O {[%emt 0:00:04]} 7. Nc3 {[%emt 0:00:07]} Ne4 {[%emt 0:00:
06]} 8. Bd2 {[%emt 0:00:06]} Bf6 {[%emt 0:00:04] This is all well known and
has been seen many times and now Ding Liren comes up with a move that has been
played only once before.} 9. Re1 $5 {[%emt 0:00:09] According to the databases
this move has been played only once before between Adamski and Kruszynski.} a6
{[%emt 0:11:43] This is a weird move, the main idea is to make a waiting move,
threaten b5 in some instances and also play d6 followed by Nd7, without having
to worry about Ng5 ideas.} (9... d6 {might have been Rapport's idea, but it
leads to a minus position after} 10. Ng5 $1 Nxc3 11. Qc2 $16) 10. Ne5 $1 {
[%emt 0:16:55] This is a good practical decision, White maintains slight
pressure on the position.} (10. Rc1 {was also possible, but it leads to normal
positions.}) (10. Qc2 Nxd2 11. Qxd2 d6 {[%cal Gb8d7] Followed by Nd7 gives
Black the bishop pair.}) 10... Nxc3 {[%emt 0:09:05]} 11. Bxc3 {[%emt 0:00:06]}
Bxg2 {[%emt 0:00:21]} 12. Kxg2 {[%emt 0:00:03] White is better developed and
has superior development. It is a slight edge, but still not so easy to
extinguish.} d6 {[%emt 0:03:48]} 13. Ng4 {[%emt 0:01:57]} Be7 {[%emt 0:01:14]}
14. e4 {[%emt 0:00:34]} b5 {[%emt 0:06:43] The problem with Rapport is that he
can never play normal chess! He will always try to go for activity. In this
position it could have been better to just finish development with Nd7,
although after f4 Black is still worse. But now Ding plays very strong chess.}
(14... Nd7) 15. Qe2 {[%emt 0:10:54]} bxc4 {[%emt 0:13:22]} 16. d5 {[%emt 0:01:
09]} (16. Qxc4 {was also possible and perhaps not at all a bad idea, but Ding
wanted more.}) 16... Qc8 {[%emt 0:05:33]} (16... e5 17. Ne3 $16) 17. e5 $1 {
[%emt 0:21:52] The Chinese player made this move after 22 minutes of thought.
He invested a lot of time in this idea and was able to calculate that he gets
a good position in all lines.} (17. Qxc4 {was also possible.}) 17... exd5 {
[%emt 0:04:22]} (17... Qb7 18. Rad1 $16) (17... dxe5 18. Qxe5 $18) 18. exd6 {
[%emt 0:00:05]} cxd6 $1 {[%emt 0:09:38]} (18... Bxd6 {which looks the most
natural is refuted by a very brilliant little queen move that was seen by Ding.
} 19. Qf3 $3 Nd7 (19... Nc6 20. Bxg7 $1 $18) 20. Nh6+ $18) 19. Qxe7 {[%emt 0:
08:35]} (19. Rad1 $16 {was also possible keeping all the advantages intact.})
19... d4 {[%emt 0:01:09]} (19... Qxg4 20. Qb7 Nd7 {Looks normal but White is
better after} 21. h3 Qf5 (21... Qg5 22. Qxd7 d4 $1 {And now White has to find
the only move to hold the advantage.} 23. Bb4 $1 $18 (23. Bxd4 $2 Qd5+ $17))
22. g4 {The knight is lost.} Qg5 (22... Nc5 23. Qxa8 $18 Qd7 24. Qxd5) 23. Qxd7

Bc3 $16 {Also gives White a very pleasant position.}) 20... Qc6 {[%emt 0:00:22]
This move was missed by Ding. But luckily it spoils nothing. White still has
many ways to keep his advantage.} (20... dxc3 21. Qxa8 cxb2 22. Rab1 c3 (22...

suggested by Surya Sekhar Ganguly on Twitter.}) 22. Qxc6 {[%emt 0:01:13]} Nxc6
{[%emt 0:00:02]} 23. Ne3 {[%emt 0:02:33]} (23. Bxg7 {was also possible, but
Ding decides to keep things simple.}) 23... Nxd4 {[%emt 0:00:16]} 24. Rad1 {
[%emt 0:00:06] White is a pawn down, but all of Black's pawns are weak and
there are soon going to fall one by one.} f4 {[%emt 0:05:37] Ding,L (2771)

11]} fxe3 {[%emt 0:00:10]} 26. Rxe3 {[%emt 0:00:02] Such positions are Ding
Liren's forte. As he said after the game, the endgame might not be winning,
but it is extremely unpleasant to play as Black here.} Rab8 {[%emt 0:21:00]}
27. Re2 {[%emt 0:00:06]} c3 {[%emt 0:00:31]} (27... d5 28. Rxd5 $16) 28. bxc3 {

your calculation.} (37. Kd4 {was also possible.}) 37... axb5 {[%emt 0:00:32]}

Kxb5 {[%emt 0:00:28]} 40. Kd4 {[%emt 0:00:00] White has given up the pawn, but
cut off his opponent's king.} Rf7 {[%emt 0:00:35]} 41. Kxd5 {[%emt 0:00:55] It
might be a case of premature resignation, but I was quite sure that White
would have been able to convert his advantage.} 1-0
