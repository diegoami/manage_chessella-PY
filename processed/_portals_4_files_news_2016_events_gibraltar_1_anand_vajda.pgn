1. c4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. a4 e6 {This is more in the style
of QGA.} (5... Bf5 {is of course the main line.}) 6. e3 c5 7. Bxc4 Nc6 8. O-O
cxd4 9. exd4 Be7 10. Qe2 O-O (10... Nxd4 11. Nxd4 Qxd4 12. Bb5+ {Followed by
Rd1 is just too much initiative for the pawn.}) 11. Rd1 {Usually White would
like to place his rooks on e1 and d1 but here the d4 pawn was hanging and
hence this move was necessary.} Nb4 12. Bg5 h6 13. Bh4 Bd7 14. Ne5 {Anand
plays in typical style when one has the isolated pawn and has a nice
initiative.} Be8 $6 (14... Bc6 {was much better. The exchange on c6 is really
in Black's favour.} 15. Nxc6 bxc6 $1 $11 {And the control on d5 square is
quite high.}) 15. a5 $5 Nfd5 $1 {Getting this knight to d5 is always better as
it invites White for an exchange on e7.} 16. Bg3 (16. Bxe7 Nxe7 17. a6 {could
have been slightly preferable for White than what happened in the game.}) 16...
Rc8 17. a6 bxa6 18. Nxd5 exd5 $1 19. Bxa6 Rc2 $1 {Black has excellent play and
has equalised the position without any difficulties.} 20. Rd2 Rxd2 21. Qxd2 Qb6
22. Bf1 a5 23. h4 Bf6 24. Ra3 Nc6 25. Nxc6 Bxc6 26. Rxa5 Qxd4 27. Qxd4 Bxd4 $11
{The position has petered out into equality and we have to agree that Szidonia
played a wonderful game.} 28. b4 {This advantage of outside passed pawn is not
so great. There isn't enough material on the board for it to be something
tangible.} Ra8 29. Bd3 Bb6 30. Rxa8+ Bxa8 31. Kf1 f6 32. h5 Kf7 33. Ke2 Bc6 34.

40. Be8 Bb7 41. b5 Ba8 42. Bg6 Bb7 43. Bf5 Ba8 44. Bc8 Kc7 45. Be6 Kd6 $11 {
And there doesn't really seem a way to breakthrough.}) 39... Bc8 40. g4 Bd7 41.
b6 Bc8 42. Bg6 Kc6 43. Bf5 Bb7 44. Be6 Kxb6 45. Bxd5 Bc8 $1 {A draw was agreed.
A fine game by the Hungarian player.} (45... Bxd5 $4 {Of course after playing
such an awesome game you aren't going to fall for that!} 46. Kxd5 $18) 1/2-1/2
