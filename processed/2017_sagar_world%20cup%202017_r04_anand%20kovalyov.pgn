1. e4 {[%emt 0:00:00]} c5 {[%emt 0:00:08] It is always exciting to see
Sicilian on the board.} 2. Nf3 {[%emt 0:00:00]} d6 {[%emt 0:00:09]} 3. d4 {

[%emt 0:02:49]} 10. O-O {[%emt 0:01:31] Short castle might not be the most
exciting thing in the position, but as Anish says, in Najdorf, the most
ambitious approach might not be the best one, as it is studied and analyzed
extensively.} Rc8 {[%emt 0:03:19]} 11. Qd2 {[%emt 0:02:10] We are already in a
fresh position.} b5 {[%emt 0:07:10]} 12. Rfd1 {[%emt 0:05:23]} Nb6 {[%emt 0:09:

[%emt 0:01:15]} Bd7 {[%emt 0:00:46]} 17. a5 {[%emt 0:05:20] Anand has fixed
the weakness on a6 and is clearly better now. Now because of the position
itself, but because he has a key idea o the next move.} Qb7 {[%emt 0:09:13]}
18. Qe3 $1 {[%emt 0:03:40] This is the move that Kovalyov had missed. The
queen comes to b6 and the a6 pawn is lost.} Be7 {[%emt 0:13:19]} (18... Rb8 {
is just too slow and is met with} 19. f4 $16) 19. Qb6 $1 {[%emt 0:01:47] A
very strong idea by Vishy attacking the a6 pawn.} Qxb6 {[%emt 0:00:38]} 20.
axb6 {[%emt 0:00:09]} Rb8 {[%emt 0:00:08]} 21. Rxa6 {[%emt 0:00:42]} Bd8 {
[%emt 0:00:07] There is no real good way to defend the b6 pawn, but White
should be better, because of superior development and co-ordination.} 22. b7 $5

is met with d6+ cutting off the co-ordination.} Bxb2 (25... Rhc8 $14) 26. d6+

22... Ke7 {[%emt 0:06:58]} 23. Nc5 $5 {[%emt 0:08:44] Anand is in an inspired
mood and makes a very practical sacrifice. Objectively it might not be the
best, but Vishy has seen that it poses good enough problems for his opponent
to try it out.} (23. Rda1 Rxb7 24. Ra8 $14 {should give White a small edge,
but nothing substantial.}) 23... dxc5 {[%emt 0:10:18] As Kovalyov said after
the game, if Nc5 worked it could have been the game of the year, but
fortunately it didn't!} 24. d6+ {[%emt 0:00:16]} Kf6 {[%emt 0:00:48]} (24...
Ke6 25. Bc4+ Kf5 26. Bd5 $17 {Black seems all tied up, but White is not
threatening anything concretely and the position should be interesting and
unbalanced.}) 25. Bf3 {[%emt 0:00:17]} Kf5 $5 {[%emt 0:01:26] The king is
taking part actively in the battle and threatening e4.} 26. Bd5 {[%emt 0:07:01]

Anton plays this position well and is not afraid of moving his king around the
board.} 29. Ra5 {[%emt 0:04:50]} Bxb2 {[%emt 0:00:15]} 30. Rxc5+ {[%emt 0:00:

and White is in trouble.} 36. h4 {[%emt 0:01:25]} Kf6 {[%emt 0:01:14]} 37. g3 {
[%emt 0:01:47]} f4 $1 {[%emt 0:03:30] This key move seals the game in Black's
favour. The idea is that you activate your light squared bishop.} 38. Be4 {

the piece and rightly resigned.} 1-0
