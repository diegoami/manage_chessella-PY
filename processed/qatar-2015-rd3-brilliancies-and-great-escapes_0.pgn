({Had White not been down to less than *one minute*, he would not doubt have
seen} 28. e6 $1 {a move that begs to be analyzed} Rh7 {and then worked out the
consequences of} 29. Ne5 {after which all the lines work for White.}) 28...

Bd4  h3  40. Rh1  Re2 {[#] (0s) Time control has been made, and whatever White
had earlier is but a long-lost dream. Black's powerful pair of rooks and passed
f- and h-pawns are deadly.} 41. Kd3  Rg2  42. a4  h2  43. b4  Rh3+  44. Kc2

50. Nf1  f5  51. a5  f4  52. Bc5  Kh3 $2 {(179s) A mistake that throws the win
away, but to be fair, seeing the entire line that ensues was far from obvious.}
({Black needed to play} 52... Kf5 $1 {to prevent White's pawns from playing a
decisive roll.}) 53. b5  Re1 {[#] (39s) This forces the line that follows,
after which White will save the half point.} 54. Rxh2+  Rxh2  55. Nxh2  Kxh2 
56. Bd6  Kg3  57. a6  bxa6  58. b6 $1  Rb1  59. Bb4 {(12s) Protecting the
advance.} Rd1+  60. Kc2  Rh1  61. b7  Rh8  62. Bd6 $1 {(3s) and it is
remarkable that the pin is the saving factor. Had the Black king been on g2,
then advancing the f-pawn would win. Was Kg3 a mistake? No, since the pawn was
pinned anyhow, and needed to be protected.} a5  63. b8=Q  Rxb8  64. Bxb8  a4
