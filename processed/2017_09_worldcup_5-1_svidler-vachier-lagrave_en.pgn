{Peter Svidler and MVL have a very similar opening repertoire, both of course,
being huge opening experts. So when they sat at the board it was real a battle
of choosing the line in which the opponent would feel the most uncomfortable.}

this move after quite some thought.} Nf6 {[%emt 0:00:06]} 3. Nc3 {[%emt 0:03:

[%emt 0:05:18] As Svidler said, White has many options at this point. He went
for the one that would be the most uncomfortable for Maxime.} Nb4 {[%emt 0:00:

{[%emt 0:00:06]} 8. Kf1 {[%emt 0:00:06]} Ne6 {[%emt 0:01:10] This knight
diamond movement is quite well known now. Black makes all of these knight
moves in the hope that he would be able to capitalize on the weakness of the
d4 square.} 9. h4 $5 {[%emt 0:04:41] Why would someone make a move like this?
What is the point? The main idea of this move is to stop Black from playing g6.

followed by g6 putting all the resources on the d4 square.} g6 $11) 9... Nd4 {
[%emt 0:04:38]} (9... Nc6 {is also possible.}) (9... g6 {The main advantage of
the move h4: the fact that g6 is no longer possible.} 10. h5 $1 $16) 10. d3 {[%emt 0:03:

the game Maxime said that this entire plan with Be6 and taking on b5 was
played pretty quickly by him and he didn't like what he did.} 12. Bf4 {[%emt 0:

that he can now play e6, Be7 0-0 and finish his development. But he had missed
something in the line starting with} 15. b4 $1 e6 (15... cxb4 16. Rc1 {seems
to give White good compensation, but I would say Black's position looks fine.})

it's game over.}) 15. Rc1 {[%emt 0:08:45]} b5 {[%emt 0:07:04]} 16. Bb3 {

Svidler had all the right to believe that his position was very pleasant.} Na5

[%emt 0:04:54] The knight comes to b3 and the other rook to c1. It looks
really bad for MVL.} Rfc8 {[%emt 0:04:35]} 25. Nb3 {[%emt 0:03:01]} a5 {

but now the h4 pawn is hanging.} Bxh4 27. Nxc5 Nxc5 28. Bxc5 $14 {White is
surely better as he has won the c5 pawn for the one on h4. However, Svidler
wanted more. He wanted to keep his h-pawn and then win the c5 pawn as well.})

this move. He thought that it gave Black good chances to equalize.} (32. Rc7 $5

best. It doesn't create any threats yet, but White is just dominating.} Be7 33.

55]} 37. Nc3 $6 {[%emt 0:00:41] This is one of those moves that you make
naturally. Your knight is on the first rank and you want to develop it.
However, Svidler said after the game that stopping Black's h5 was important
and he should have gone g4.} (37. g4 $1 $14) 37... h5 $1 {[%emt 0:00:04] After
this Black has relatively fewer problems.} 38. f4 {[%emt 0:06:36]} (38. Rb4 f6

Rb7+ {[%emt 0:05:50] I have a feeling that White has a small edge here, some
slight pressure, but MVL had already passed the worst and the result would
most probably have been draw, so the players saved themselves some energy.}
