{Welcome everyone! This is GM Aleksandr Lenderman with the Geneva Grand Prix
Round 7 Game of the Day. Today the choice was clear to me, since we had a
decisive game on one of the top boards, and also it was a nice, clean game by
Radjabov, who is in excellent form in this tournament.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c5
(2... g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 {Is another common line for Grunfeld players,
but these days many players don't want to venture here, since White has a lot
of additional dangerous options here.}) 3. Nc3 d5 {As far as I know, the most
common way for Grunfeld Players to play against this White's move order.} (3...
g6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 d5 {Is also a common way for Grunfeld players to play,
but still, I think White has some pressure here if he knows the line well.} (
5... Bg7 6. e4 {Leads to a Maroczy Bind Structure, which most Grunfeld players
wouldn't want to play, since this is basically suffering for most of the game,
and there aren't as many dynamic options for Black here.})) 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e3
(5. e4 {Is also a very common move here, after which Black usually plays Nb4
and leads to very sharp positions.} Nb4) 5... Nxc3 {Definitely not the only
move here.} (5... e6 {As far as I know this is the most common alternative,
which will most likely lead to an IQP (isolated pawn position), where White has
the isolated d4 pawn but will have attacking chances.} 6. d4) (5... Nc6 { Isn't
played as often because of an unpleasant...} 6. Bb5 {After which Black will
probably still have to eventually play e6, but now he has allowed a slightly
annoying pin, and therefore some concessions.}) (5... g6 {Is also not as
accurate, right away, since here after a strong queen move, disturbing Black's
harmony, he has to make some annoying concessions, for example...} 6. Qa4+ $1
{This is already unpleasant for Black.} Bd7 (6... Nc6 7. Bb5 $14) 7. Qb3 $14)
6. dxc3 {And this is the first somewhat surprising move. Almost exclusively
White plays bxc3. However, Radjabov, one of the leaders at +2 (4.0/6), playing
Svidler, who has 3.5/6, half a point behind, decided to put the ball in Black's
court to try to create some kind of a battle in a dry position. That,along with
the fact that as far as I can tell, Svidler doesn't like positions that are too
dry. One game that comes to mind is Karjakin-Svidler from the 2015 World Cup
Finals, where Svidler just needed a draw to win the finals, as he had been
leading 2-1, but wasn't able to defend a slightly unpleasant but tenable
position. This no doubt had an impact on Radjabov's decision to play this kind
of a position this round. Needless to say, it paid off big time this game for
him.} Qxd1+ (6... Qc7 { Perhaps this deserves attention. This is already a rare
position though.}) 7. Kxd1 Bf5 {This move is designed against a quick e4. It's
an interesting option but definitely not the only option.} (7... Nc6 {Is an
alternative which Nepo tried against Vidit in the last Olympiad. He's also
tried b6 the game before against Wang Yue.} 8. e4 b6 9. Kc2 Bb7 10. Bf4 f6 11.
Rd1 e5 12. Bc1 (12. Bg3 $5 {Maybe this or somewhere earlier was a possible
improvement for Radjabov.}) 12... Na5 13. Bb5+ Kf7 14. Rhe1 a6 15. Bc4+ Nxc4
16. Rd7+ Be7 17. Rxb7 Rhb8 18. Rxb8 Rxb8 19. b3 Nd6 20. Nd2 b5 $11 {Black
equalized comfortably and went on to draw without particular problems. 1/2 (37)
Vidit,S (2669)-Nepomniachtchi,I (2740) Baku AZE 2016}) (7... b6 8. e4 Bb7 9.
Bb5+ Bc6 10. a4 a6 11. Bxc6+ Nxc6 12. Kc2 e6 13. Rd1 Be7 14. Bf4 Ra7 15. Nd2
$14 {Here White has some pull, in a game which ended up being a draw in...1/2
(47) Wang Yue (2728)-Nepomniachtchi, I (2719) Moscow RUS 2016}) 8. Nd2 Nc6 9.
e4 {So, White got in e4 anyway, but Black's idea was to force the White's
knight to d2 first, so that White has a harder time developing his bishop on
c1.} Be6 {This is according to my database a novelty, and possibly not the best
one.} (9... Bd7 {Was played by the late Walter Browne all the way back in
1979.} 10. Kc2 O-O-O 11. Nb3 e6 12. Be3 b6 13. Ba6+ Kc7 14. a4 Ne5 15. f3 Bd6
16. Be2 Bc6 17. Nd2 f5 {With a complex game, which ended up in a draw in the
end. But certainly both sides could probably make subtle improvements before.
1/2 (42) Andersson,U (2560) -Browne,W (2540) Banja Luka 1979}) 10. Kc2 g6
(10... O-O-O {This move deserves attention as well, since it stops Bc4 because
of Rxd2!. However, White has annoying options here as well.} 11. Nb3 (11. Bc4
$4 Rxd2+ $19) (11. Nf3 $5 { Is also interesting, trying to induce the move f6
at some point.} f6 12. Be3 b6 13. Ba6+ Kb8 14. Bf4+ Ka8) 11... b6 12. Ba6+ Kb8
13. Bf4+ Ka8 14. Rhd1 Rxd1 15. Rxd1 g6 16. Nd2 Bg7 17. Bc4 Bxc4 18. Nxc4 Rd8
19. Rd5 $14 {White has a slight pull here, but it certainly looks like Black
should be able to hold.}) 11. Bc4 Bd7 {Now it's starting to look like Black's
strategy didn't work. He's losing too many tempos and White is putting his
pieces on decent squares.} (11... Bxc4 12. Nxc4 $14 {Is also slightly
unpleasant though. White has a plan with Be3, and a4 after b6. Black's bishop
is a slight problem, in where it's very useful. }) 12. Nb3 b6 13. a4 {An
important move, not only thinking about playing a5, but also preparing to play
Bb5 after Ne5.} Ne5 14. Bb5 a6 $6 {But this move already seems like a real
inaccuracy. I don't think it was necessary to create additional weaknesses.}
(14... Bg7 15. Bf4 O-O-O {Still seems holdable for Black.}) 15. Bxd7+ Nxd7 16.
Be3 e6 17. Rhd1 O-O-O 18. Nd2 $16 {Now White already has a serious advantage.
White knight is getting back to c4, his dream square, while Black is tied down
to the weakness on b6. In general, the main reason White wanted to swop off the
light-squared bishops was because he wanted to have his knight unopposed on c4,
where it can't be bothered by the Black's bishop, and also sometimes the White
knight and bishop were redundant on the light squares.} Be7 19. Nc4 Kb7 20. a5
$1 Rhf8 {The problem for Black is that...} (20... b5 $2 {only makes things
worse because of...} 21. Nd6+ Bxd6 22. Rxd6 $18 {And Black is just collapsing
here with his weaknesses.}) 21. axb6 Nxb6 22. Na5+ Kc7 23. Bf4+ Bd6 24. Bh6 $1
{A very important decision here. White didn't want to trade off the dark
squared bishops since then he would not have enough fire power to really apply
maximum pressure on Black's weaknesses.} (24. Rxd6 Rxd6 25. Nb3 (25. Rd1 Nc8
26. Nc4 Rfd8 27. b3 f6 28. Nxd6 Nxd6 {And since the pawn endgame is going to be
drawn, Black will be able to untangle himself eventually with Kc6, and even
though he's worse, he can still fight here.}) 25... c4 26. Nc5 Ra8 27. Nxa6+
Kc6 28. Bxd6 Kxd6 29. Rd1+ Kc6 30. Nb4+ Kc5 {Would've won a pawn for White, but
Radjabov correctly assessed that in this position Black would have better hold
chances than in the game, since he was able to get his pieces very active and
trade off or eliminate his weaknesses just for a cost of a pawn. This is still
promising for White but it shows incredible patience not to go for this line,
which I'm sure Radjabov saw.}) 24... Rfe8 25. Nb3 {Black still won't be able to
avoid material loss in a long run, but here he also keeps his active bishop,
while Black's bishop on d6 is quite restricted and can't do much.} Ra8 26. Be3
Nd7 27. Ra5 Kc6 28. Rda1 Kb6 29. R5a4 Rec8 30. Na5 Be7 $6 {Loses in one move,
but the position was already probably lost.} (30... Kc7 31. Nc4 Be7 {Would've
prolongued the game, but White should still be winning.} 32. Rxa6 (32. Bf4+ {
Though the computer even doesnt want to take the pawn.} Kb7 33. Na5+ Kb6 34.
Rd1 Ra7 35. Nc4+ Kc6 36. Ra3 {And due to a deadly threat of Na5+ with a mating
attack, Black is already forced to play the pathetic...} e5 37. Bxe5 Nxe5 38.
Nxe5+ Kc7 39. Rd7+ Kb8 40. Rb3+ Ka8 41. Rd1 {But this is equivilant to
resignation.}) 32... Rxa6 33. Rxa6 {Should be enough for a winning advantage.})
31. Rb4+ {Black resigned since is losing after Kc7 Rb7+ Kd8 Rd1 Rc7 Nc6+ and
Black will lose at least a piece. A very nice game by Radjabov and this puts
him in a commanding position to be able to win this tournament.} 1-0
