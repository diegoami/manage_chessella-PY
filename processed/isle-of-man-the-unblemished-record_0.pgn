1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Vidit chooses the Spanish Defense against the
Dutch talent. He is capable of playing several other openings including the
Caro-Kann defense!} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3
Bb7 {Known as the Zaitsev variation, it is named after the 12th world
champion's coach, Igor Zaitsev. This fighting line has been a source of debate
for more than 27 years after Karpov (unsuccessfully) employed it against
Kasparov in their last match in 1990.} 10.d4 Re8 11. Ng5 Rf8 12. Nf3 Re8 {Both
players are gentlemen and enter the fight without repetition.} 13. Nbd2 (13.
Ng5 Rf8 14. Nf3 {is definitely a way to make a draw!}) 13... Bf8 14. a3 {There
are a number of other equally interesting moves here.} (14. d5) (14. a4) (14.
Bc2) (14. Ng5) 14... g6 15. d5 (15. Ba2 Bg7 16. b4 exd4 17. cxd4 a5 18. Qb3 Qd7
19. Bb2 {is the mainline.}) 15... Nb8 16. Nf1 Nbd7 17. Ba2 Nc5 $1 {Something
does not make sense to me: White seems to be many tempi down and his center is
about to be invaded by Black's well-placed pieces. I do not know whether it was
Bok's preperation or something else, but whatever the case White's position
does not appeal to me at all!} 18. Ng3 c6 19. Bg5 (19. b4 Na4 20. dxc6 Bxc6 21.
Qb3 Qe7 22. Bg5 Rec8 {is slightly better for Black.}) 19... cxd5 20. Bxf6 Qxf6
21. Bxd5 Bxd5 22. Qxd5 Na4 (22... Qe6 { could be an equally good or even better
choice.} 23. Rad1 Qxd5 24. Rxd5 Reb8 25. b4 Na4 26. Ne2 Be7 {with a great
endgame for Black.}) 23. Qd2 Rad8 24. Nf1 $2 { A big mistake. White does not
sense the dynamics of the position and falls for a deadly positional
pseudo-sacrifice} d5 $1 25. exd5 e4 26. N3h2 Qd6 27. Rad1 f5 {d5 will fall
soon. The question is what is White going to do about it.} 28. g4 $2 {This only
adds to White's problems.} (28. f3 Nc5 29. Re2 {and White should sit tight and
pray hard!}) 28... Nc5 29. gxf5 gxf5 30. Ng3 Nd3 31. Nxf5 Qg6+ 32. Ng3 Bc5 $1
{Black's pieces dominate the board. They are so much better that Vidit was
probably thinking: "Should I really exchange them with any of White's
pieces?".} 33. Re3 Bxe3 34. Qxe3 Rxd5 35. Ng4 h5 36. Nxe4 {The last try but
this wouldn't even work in a rapid game against Vidit!} hxg4 37. Nf6+ Qxf6 38.
Qxe8+ Kg7 39. Qe3 gxh3 40. Kh2 Qd6+ {A clean and nice finish by Vidit who
joined the pack of 3.5/4 players in the lead.} 0-1
