1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 g6 3. b3 Bg7 4. Bb2 O-O 5. Bg2 d6 6. d4 Nbd7 (6... c5 {
might be a much more interesting choice.}) 7. O-O Re8 {Black is playing not
very actively. Re8 already doesn't seem so good.} 8. a4 Rb8 9. c4 {White gains
more space.} e5 10. dxe5 Ng4 (10... dxe5 11. Nxe5 $16) 11. a5 dxe5 12. h3 Nh6
13. e4 {White's position is already preferable.} f6 14. b4 Nf8 15. Nc3 Be6 16.
Qe2 Qc8 17. Kh2 Nf7 18. Rfd1 c6 19. Bc1 $1 {The bishop will stand well on e3.}
f5 20. Be3 b6 21. axb6 axb6 22. Rac1 {Defending the knight against threats
like f4 and also preparing Nd5.} Qc7 (22... Qb7 23. b5 $16) 23. Nd5 cxd5 24.
cxd5 Qe7 25. dxe6 Nxe6 26. exf5 gxf5 27. Qb5 {Kramnik is very good at such
positions. He calculates the tactics accurately and does not let his
initiative go.} f4 28. gxf4 exf4 29. Rd7 Qf6 30. Bd2 Rbc8 31. Rxc8 Rxc8 32.
Qxb6 {Winning a pawn. Now this position might seem wild, but if you look
carefully, there is absolutely nothing that Black can do. White pieces are
perfectly posted and the exposed nature of Black's king gives Kramnik a
winning advantage.} Rc2 33. Qb7 Bf8 34. Qe4 Qg6 35. Qd5 Qf6 36. h4 Bg7 37. Bh3
Nf8 38. Rb7 h6 39. Bg4 Rb2 40. Bh5 Ng6 41. Bxg6 Qxg6 42. Rb8+ Bf8 (42... Kh7
