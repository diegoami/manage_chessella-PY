Instead of retreating it, Michael Adams finds a truly amazing solution.} 27. Bb3 $1 {The threat is of course to take on c4. If rook takes back then b5 remains weak. And if the pawn recaptures, then the b4 pawn is a passer.} Nxd2 28. Qxd2 Rxc3 {Did Mickey blunder a pawn?} 29. Re3 $1 {Of course not! He had seen extremely deep into the position. He realised that in the ensuing opposite coloured bishop scenario, initiative would be more imporant than material. The rook lift to e3 threatens Rf3 putting pressure on f7. But what if Black takes on e3?} Rxe3 30. fxe3 $1 {Fantastic play by England number one! The f-file has opened up and Michael can now pressurize the f7 pawn.} Rc7 31. Bd5 {Black is a pawn up but his bishop on f8 is clearly inferior to the monster on d5.} g6 32. Qd3 Qg5 33. Rf1 h5 34. Rf3 Qh4 35. Kh2 $1 {Safegaurding his king before embarking on the queen invasion.} Bh6 36. Qxb5 Kh7 37. Qe8 Bg7 38. Bxf7 Re7 39. Qd8 {Everything is falling apart: the d6 pawn is hanging, later the g6 pawn will disappear. All in all Matlakov's decision to resign was a perfectly valid one.} 1-0
