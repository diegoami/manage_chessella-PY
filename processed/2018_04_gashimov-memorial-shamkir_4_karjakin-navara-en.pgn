5. Nb3 Nd7 6. Nf3 {and the game takes on a less concrete character, more according to Carlsen's taste. Navara kept the game close despite having a difficult position and was probably ready to subject his preparation to a repeated test against Karjakin. ½-½ (50) Carlsen,M (2843)-Navara,D (2745) Shamkir AZE 2018})
4... e6 5. Be2 c5 $5 {The Caro-Kann is a versatile opening. Some prefer quieter and solid lines, with slow manoeuvring of the pieces, while others delay development in favour of challenging in the centre immediately.} 6. Be3 {Karjakin sees no reason to avoid a theoretical duel with Navara and chooses the principaled answer. He is considered one of the leading specialists on the white side of these lines and has already contributed to the formation of the theory thanks to his game against Pavel Eljanov from the 2010 Chess Olympiad.} Qb6 7.
