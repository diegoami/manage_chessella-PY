        2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 {This line in the Grunfeld playing the bishop 
        to f4 without first developing the knight to f3 is gaining popularity. 
        Later the knight could go to f3 or e2 depending upon the situation.} Bg7 
        5. e3 O-O 6. Rc1 c5 7. dxc5 Be6 (7... Qa5 8. cxd5 Ne4 9. Nge2 {has led 
        to some excellent results for White.}) 8. Nf3 Nc6 9. Ng5 {White moves 
        the same piece in the opening in spite of being behind in development. 
        Though this is all theory, it seems like Black should be having a very 
        good position.} Bg4 10. f3 (10. Be2 Bxe2 11. Qxe2 e5 $17) 10... e5 $1

        and sharp but you will be surprised to know that it was first played by 
        Svetozar Gilgoric against Mikhail Botvinnik in 1964!} 12. Nb5 $2 {A very 
        bad reaction and the losing move in the game.} (12. fxg4 dxc3 13. Qxd8 
        Rfxd8 14. Rxc3 {was played by Botvinnik when the position is round about 
        equal but not so easy for White to play. 0-1 (78) Botvinnik, M-Gligoric,S 
        (2575) Tel Aviv 1964}) 12... h6 (12... Bh6 {would have been pretty strong 
        as after} 13. h4 Bxg5 14. hxg5 Ne4 $3 15. Bh2 Qxg5 $19 {Both the pieces 
        are taboo and Black has a winning position.}) 13. exd4 exd4 14. fxg4 hxg5 
        (14... Re8+ {transposes to the game.}) 15. Bd3 Re8+ 16. Kf2 {If White 
        could play Rf1 and Kg1 she would be better, but unfortunately Black is 
        too well developed to allow that.} Nb4 17. Bb1 (17. Rf1 Qe7 $1 18. Kg1
