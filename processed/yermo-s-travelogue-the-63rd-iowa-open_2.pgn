{Just like in the last year's edition of the Iowa Open Mike and I meet in the
last round money game. He won a very nice game then, and now it's my turn to
try.} 1. d4 g6 $5 {As a draw would leave us out of prize money, Mike is not
interested in playing a "correct" defense. It is "all-in".} 2. e4 d6 3. Nc3 Bg7
4. Bg5 $5 {Normally I like this system against the regular Pirc Defense, but
here this move is more questionable, as Black may decide to go for the old
Ujtelki System, where the pawn goes to h6 anyway.} h6 $5 ({A lot of people like
} 4... a6 5. Qd2 (5. a4 Nd7 6. Bc4 c5 7. dxc5 Nxc5 8. Nge2 {Henriquez
Villagra-Fressinet, World Rapid 2016.}) 5... Nd7 6. f4 b5 7. Nf3 Bb7 8. O-O-O
b4 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. exd5 Ngf6 {Kovalev-Smirin, 2017}) (4... c6 5. Qd2 b5 6. f4
Nd7 {may be considered the main line.}) 5. Be3 ({Objectively speaking} 5. Bh4 {
is a better move, but I was concerned with} c5 $5 6. dxc5 Qa5 {[#]An
interesting idea, played by GM Gawain Jones} 7. Qd2 {should be the normal
reaction.} ({On} 7. Bb5+ {Black has} Bd7 (7... Nc6 8. Nge2 dxc5 {
Sukandar-Jones, 2012}) {as} 8. Bxd7+ Nxd7 9. cxd6 Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 Qxc3+ 11. Kf1
Qc4+ 12. Qd3 Rc8 {gives Black excellent chances in the endgame where White's
pawns are weak.}) 7... Bxc3 $1 {This is totally critical.} (7... Qxc5 8. Bd3
Nf6 9. f4 Nc6 10. Nge2 {would transpose to Yermolinsky-Gulko, US Championship
1996, the game I managed to win.}) 8. bxc3 g5 9. Bg3 Qxc5 10. Qd4 Qxd4 11. cxd4
f5 {with complex play.}) 5... Nd7 6. Qd2 a6 {Once again, White is put to the
test: is he going to castle long right into the black pawn storm or is he going
to restrain his own possibilities?} 7. a4 {I chose the latter. The implications
of a2-a4 are obvious: White is no longer able to castle long.} e6 8. Nf3 b6 9.
Bc4 Ne7 {This is the Ujtelki System, named after a Czech IM who would play it
against anyone, including twice against Spassky! OK, he lost both times, but he
also beat Matulovic, Nezhmetdinov and Kholmov with it!} ( 9... Ngf6 10. d5 exd5
(10... e5 $5 {is more in the spirit of Black's setup.}) 11. Bxd5 Nxd5 12. exd5
{illustrates White's main idea. In a slightly more open position Balck is
hampered by the h6-pawn, which doesn't allow him to castle.}) 10. O-O Bb7 11.
Rfe1 $1 {[#] I found this idea a few years ago while analyzing a game I lost to
Vadim Milov in the Canadian Open 2007} g5 {A logical step forward.}
({Obviously,} 11... d5 {loses to} 12. exd5 exd5 13. Nxd5 Nxd5 14. Bg5+) ({I
wonder if anyone would be willing to look at} 11... c6 $5) 12. d5 $1 {Now White
begins to fight for the light squares.} e5 (12... Bxc3 {was mentioned by Mike
after the game, but I didn't think he was serious. After} 13. Qxc3 e5 14. h4 g4
15. Nh2 h5 16. Nf1 Ng6 17. g3 {White stands better.}) 13. Ne2 f5 $5 {Very
principled play.} ({On} 13... O-O {White switches tracks to} 14. h4 $1 g4 15.
Nh2) 14. exf5 Nxf5 {[#] Here comes my star move.} 15. Ned4 $1 { That rook on e1
plays the key role.} Qf6 16. Ne6 Kf7 ({In reply to} 16... g4 { White has the
same motif again,} 17. Nfd4 $1 exd4 18. Nxg7+ Kf7 19. Nxf5 $18) 17. Qe2 Rhc8
18. g4 $5 {I admit getting caught in the heat of the battle. There was no real
need for White to push the pawn off his king.} ({A healthy strategy would be to
occupy the e4-square,} 18. Nd2 Kg8 19. Ne4 Qg6 {and then possibly look into}
20. Qg4 Nf8 21. Nxg7 Kxg7 22. Ng3) 18... Ne7 {This was not a blunder, as Mike
saw my idea coming.} ({I anticipated} 18... Nxe3 19. fxe3 Kg8 20. Nd2 Qe7 21.
Ne4 Nf8 22. Ng3) 19. Nfxg5+ {[#]} Kg8 $1 {Played instantly! } (19... hxg5 20.
Bxg5 Qg6 21. Bd3 {was the point of my play.}) 20. Nxg7 Kxg7 21. Ne6+ $6 {I just
couldn't stop pushing everything forward.} ({Once again,} 21. Ne4 Qg6 22. Rad1
{was a more solid choice.}) 21... Kh8 22. g5 Rg8 23. Kf1 $2 {Switching to
positional tracks was no longer an option.} ({The only way to justify what I
had done to my position was} 23. Qg4 Nxd5 24. Rad1) 23... Qf7 ( 23... Qf5 24.
Qh5) 24. Qd3 Qh5 (24... Nf8 $1 25. Nxc7 Rc8 26. Bxb6 Rxg5 { would have
completely turned the tables. With a black knight arriving in f4 in a matter of
moves. White would find his king in deep trouble.}) 25. Rad1 {[#]} hxg5 $6
{This just feels wrong.} (25... b5 26. Ba2 {doesn't change much,}) ({ but}
25... Nf8 $1 {remains critical:} 26. Nxc7 Rc8 27. Bxb6 Nd7 28. a5 Rxg5 29. Re3
Nf5 30. Rh3 Qg4 {is one giant mess of a position.}) 26. Bxg5 Nc5 $4 { An abrupt
end of the game that could have gone either way.} (26... Rxg5 $1 27. Nxg5 Nc5
28. Qh3 Qxh3+ 29. Nxh3 Nxa4 {would have given Black some compensation: } 30.
