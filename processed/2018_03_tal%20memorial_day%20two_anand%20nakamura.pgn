9. Nbd2 h6 10. Re1 Ne7 11. Bb3 Ng6 12. d4 Re8 13. Bc2 {This is all standard
and has been seen many times.} Bd7 $5 {Nakamura follows Wesley So's play
against MVL.} 14. Nf1 c5 {With this move the d5 square has a hole, and White
immediately sets his eyes on it.} 15. dxc5 dxc5 16. Ne3 b5 17. axb5 axb5 18. c4
$5 Bc6 (18... bxc4 19. Nxc4 $14) 19. cxb5 Bxb5 20. Qxd8 Rexd8 21. Nd5 {White
has this advantage of Ba7 being pinned to Ra8. And hence he can make this move.

Nxe5 Bxe5 (27... Bxc3 28. bxc3 Rxd5 29. Nxg6 {is also a difficult endgame to
hold.} Rd3 30. Rc1 {Slowly White will consolidate and try to push, although
objectively this still should be possible to hold.}) 28. Rxe5 Re8 29. f4 $1 g5
30. Rxe8+ Bxe8 31. fxg5 hxg5 32. g4 {Vishy said after the game that during the
battle he was very sure that he would win this endgame. But later he wasn't
100% sure.} Kf7 33. Kf2 Ba4 {The bishop is looking to enter d1-f3-g2 in order
to attack the kingside pawns.} 34. Ke3 Bd1 35. Kd4 $6 {With this move Anand
seems to have given up the win.} (35. Bd2 {was the winning move. The point
being, right now the king on e3 is perfectly placed as it dominates the bishop
on d1. By improving the bishop White now threatens to play Kd4 and take the
pawn on g5.} Kf6 36. Kd4 Bf3 37. Kc5 Bg2 38. Bxg5+ $1 Kxg5 (38... Kf7 39. h4

is an interesting attempt, but falls short because of} Bg2 37. Kc6 Ke8 (37...

Hikaru. He should have just continued his plan to taking the h3 and g4 pawns.}

taken.} Bxh3 39. d6+ Kd8 40. d7 Bxg4 41. Ba5+ $18) 38. Kc6 (38. Kd6 Bxg4 39.
