a4 Qg5 28. f3 Rd6 29. Rd1 Kf7 30. Bc2 Rxd1+ 31. Bxd1 {[#] First of all if you
want to learn how to create something from nothing, to squeeze water from a
stone, you must study this game carefully from this point onwards. The position
is very drawish and it is not clear why any side should be better but Kramnik
makes use of his trumps excellently.} f4 $5 {A very counter-intuitive move.
This spoils the structure and isolates the e6 pawn. But there are some upsides
to it too. It White replies e4, all his pawns are fixed on the light squares
and if he takes on f4 as in the game then the d5 square is a fixed outpost for
the light squared bishop. Of course it is not much but there is some progress!}
32. exf4 Qxf4 33. Qd3 Qe5 34. h3 (34. Kf2 Qxh2 $17) (34. g3 { It might be
positionally desirable, to place your pawns on the opposite colour from your
bishop but after} Qb2 {there will always be some problems with the f3 or the b3
pawns although} 35. Bc2 {might hold out here.}) 34... Ke7 { A micro edge that
Black has in this position is that his king is much more active than White's
king. It is a joy to see how Kramnik makes use of that imbalance. And also the
pawns a4, b3 are currently on light squares, and so are f3-g2-h3. Vladimir
fixes them so that they will remain targets for his bishop.} 35. Bc2 Qc5+ 36.
Kh1 a5 {b3 pawn fixed forever. Something to bite on!} 37. Qd2 (37. Qg6 Qc3 $15)

being.} 40. Qc2 Kd6 41. Bc4 {White has been able to activate his bishop and it
stands wonderfully on c4. The position should be equal now.} Be8 42. Kh1 h5 $1

Be4 Bd5 $1 {A curious situation: if the bishop is taken it gives Black a passed
pawn and if it is not then there is constant pressure on the b3 pawn. It's
quite a confusing situation for Matlakov. Besides his king is caged on h1.} 51.
Kh2 (51. Qc8 $5 Bxe4 52. fxe4 Qxe4 53. Qd8+ {leads to a draw by perpetual.} Kc5
54. Qxa5+ Kd4 {This is similar to the game, but the pawn is on e6 and not on d5
and this increases the drawing chances for White.}) 51... Qe3 52. Bxd5 Qe5+ 53.
Kh1 exd5 54. Qc8 Qe1+ 55. Kh2 Qe5+ 56. Kh1 Qd6 57. Qe8 Kc5 $1 {A bold decision,
playing for a win. You can see how this position is a picture of complete
victory for Black's play, how he made use of all the imbalances to his favour
while White did not. The king is active on c5 and the white pawns have been
fixed by a5 and h4. The margin of error is very small here. Only one move gives
equality and Matlakov wasn't able to find it.} (57... d4 58. Qb5+ Ka7 59. Qxa5+
Kb8 60. Qd2 $11) 58. Qb5+ $6 (58. Qe1 $1 {Stopping the march of the black king
was the only way to draw.}) 58... Kd4 59. Qxa5 Kd3 $17 {The d-pawn shepherd by
the king and the queen will spell White's doom.} 60. Qb5+ Kc3 61. Qa5+ Kc2 62.
