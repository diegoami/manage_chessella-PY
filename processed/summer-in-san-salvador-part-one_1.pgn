{The second prize winner, Sergey Tiviakov, seemed to have learned something
from the incident above. In this position he could have played for an attack
with 12.Qe2 for if 12...Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.Bh6 White has strong initiative.
But he wisely decided that the lesser pieces the lesser "dangers" and gladly
entered a slightly better ending where he could prove his known technique:} 12.
Be3 Ne6 13. Bxc6 Qxd1 14. Rxd1 bxc6 15. Na3 a5 16. Nc4 Ba6 {Black has managed
to question the stability of the blockade on light squares but the c5-pawn is
hoplessly weak:} 17. Nb6 Rad8 18. Nd7 Rfe8 19. Nxc5 Nxc5 20. Bxc5 {and Sergey
won soon.} 1-0
