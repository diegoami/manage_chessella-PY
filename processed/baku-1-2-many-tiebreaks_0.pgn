Bd5 {Ni Hua must win against Mareco to force a tiebreak, and things are looking sharp. He is up a pawn and Black's king feels very unsafe. He has to be careful not to allow certain drawn endgames, but if he keeps enough pieces on the board Black's defenses should collapse with time.} 35. Kh2 $2 { Overlooking or underestimating the following move} (35. Ra1 $16) 35... Rxc2 $1 36. Qxc2 Bb3 37. Qd3 Bxd1 38.
