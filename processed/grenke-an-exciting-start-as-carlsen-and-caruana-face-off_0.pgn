} d6 $5 {A Kings Indian from Magnus!} 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. d5 Nb4 8. a3 $6 {Helping
the black knight to re-route to c5 feels wrong.} (8. e4 {is the way to go.})
8... Na6 {[#]} 9. Nd4 {This only invites action in the center.} ({It's already
a bit uncomfortable for White to rely on trusted setups, e.g} 9. e4 e6 10. dxe6

12. f3 {as the counterplay with} Nh5 {arrives too soon to his taste. Black has
a direct threat of Bxd4, followed by Nb3, along with the Qh4 stuff.}) 9... e5
10. dxe6 ({Keeping the position closed with} 10. Nb3 $5 {is more in tune with
White's normal play in the King's Indian.}) 10... fxe6 11. O-O e5 12. Nb3 (12.
Nf3 c6 13. b4 {feels more natural, although with the time White has wasted it's
hard to expect him to get any advantage.}) 12... c6 13. e4 Nc7 14. f4 $5 {
Fabiano sends a message to Magnus by not backing down, even if the opening was
far from perfect for him.} Ne6 15. f5 {[#]} Nd4 ({Carlsen rejected} 15... Qb6+

Black's victory.}) 17... d5 18. Be3 dxc4 19. Nxc5 Qc7 20. Qe2 Qf7 21. g4 { The
resulting position is rather complex. White should have some compensation.} b6

position while low on time.} (26. Nd3 Ba6 27. Rfe1 Nd7 {is bad for White, just
look at his Nb3.}) 26... bxc5 27. Bxg7 Kxg7 28. Nd2 Bb7 29. f6+ Kf8 $5 {
Perhaps, a little too fancy.} ({Black had} 29... Kf7 30. Nc4 Ke6 31. Rfe1 e4

} 31. Nc4 {is answered by} Ba6) 31... Bxe4 32. Rxe4 c4 {[#] By all rules this
endgame should be winning for Black, and we would expect Carlsen's technique to
do the job.} 33. g4 Rb8 ({Possible was} 33... d3 34. h4 ({In four rooks endings

a move like this? The rook goes passive and abandons its d-pawn. The point is,
Black doesn't need that pawn, as he facilitates the race with his a-pawn being
the main horse.} 55. Kxd3 {White cannot do anything else. His pawns are stopped
