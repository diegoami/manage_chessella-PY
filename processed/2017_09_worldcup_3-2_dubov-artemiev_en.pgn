thinks a lot for his moves. While he was deciding on what he would play, Dubov
decided that he would sacrifice his bishop on b5 if he got the opportunity.} (

[%emt 0:01:28] Wow! That this was an over the board decision makes it all the more impressive.
Dubov's idea in this game was to get such a complicated position that the
thought of a draw was removed from his mind and he would be prepared for a
full fledged fight.} g4 {[%emt 0:18:27]} (13... axb5 14. Ndxb5 Qc5 15. Bf2 (15.
