1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nc3 c5 {Expressing a willingness to
play...a Benoni structure! Again Gawain Jones brings something new to the top
table. Obviously ...c6 or ...d6 are completely normal.} 6. dxc5 Qa5 7. Qa4 (7.
Bd2 Qxc5 8. Rc1 d6 9. b3 Nc6 10. Nh3 Bxh3 11. Bxh3 d5 $132 {was a game
featuring another English star on the Black side of this line: Greet,A-Howell,
D England 2017}) 7... Qxc5 8. Be3 Qc7 (8... Qh5 9. h3 $1 $14 {is strangely
unpleasant}) 9. c5 {This is very maximalist play, trying to rule out both ...
d6 and ...b6 at once.} Nc6 $6 {Black prepares a gambit, but this may not have
been best.} (9... Na6 $5 {leads to some lines which just have to be mentioned!}
10. Rc1 $6 (10. Qb5 Ng4 $132) (10. Nb5 Qe5 11. Bd4 Qf5 12. Rc1 d5 $132) 10...
Nxc5 $1 {Ignoring the idea White had set up against this. The move works due
to the filthy detail} 11. Nb5 Qc6 $3 $15 {and suddenly Black is the one
playing for an edge.}) 10. Rd1 b6 {Practically not a bad move, as everything
else is just nice for White.} (10... Qb8 11. Nf3 b6 {is too slow: now White
almost wins on the spot with} 12. Bf4 $16) 11. cxb6 Qb8 12. bxa7 Qxb2 13. Nb5
$1 {Most accurate, but unfortunately for Black also quite easy to find.} Bb7
14. Qb3 Qxb3 (14... Qe5 $5 15. Nf3 Qh5 {is actually not trivial for White to
play- the best move is apparently} 16. Nh4 $1 $16) 15. axb3 Nxa7 16. Bxb7 Rab8
{Bringing about an endgame where Black can put up some very inspired
resistance, but ultimately should lose against good play.} 17. Nxa7 Rxb7 18. f3
Rxb3 (18... e6 19. Nh3 Nd5 20. Bf2 Nc3 21. Rd2 d5 {is also maybe interesting,
with the idea of ...d4 and ...e5 to play against White's minor pieces}) 19. Bf2
Ra8 20. Nh3 Rb7 21. O-O Rbxa7 22. Bxa7 Rxa7 23. Ra1 Rxa1 24. Rxa1 $16 {It is
now just a technical question. While the fortress possibilities are not small,
and more than likely with perfect play the game is actually a draw, Black is
always going to lose this in a practical game unless he (for instance) manages
to exchange knights.} d5 25. Ra7 Bf8 26. Kg2 Ne8 27. Ra8 Nd6 28. Ng5 h6 29. Nh7
$5 {An interesting call, and not one I necessarily agree with.} Kxh7 30. Rxf8
Kg7 31. Rd8 Nc4 32. g4 e6 33. h4 Kf6 (33... Ne3+ $5 {deserved consideration. I
think if Black can get ...g5 for free then he draws, but White's tempi don't
work out either e.g.} 34. Kf2 Nd1+ 35. Kg3 (35. Ke1 Ne3 {and since ...Ng2 is
threatened White will have to go back.}) 35... g5 36. e4 Nc3 $1 37. Rc8 Ne2+ $1
{It is rather useful that this is check.} 38. Kf2 Nf4 $11 {This position has
got to be a fortress.}) 34. Rh8 Kg7 35. Rc8 Nd6 36. Rc6 Nb5 37. e3 g5 38. h5 {
So Black got ...g5 in but his knight has lost its bearings a little bit.} Na3
39. Kg3 Nc4 $2 {Losing a pawn, and possibly the decisive mistake.} (39... Nb5
40. Kf2 Kf6 {and even though it feels uncomfortable Black may be able to get
back on track soon with ...Ke7 and ...Nd6, since taking the h-pawn gets
White's rook trapped.}) 40. e4 Ne5 41. exd5 exd5 42. Rd6 Nd3 43. Rxd5 Nf4 44.
Rf5 Ne6 {Initially I thought there were still chances for this to be a
fortress but then I realised Black has too many targets. Maybe with the
h-pawns off the board?} 45. Kf2 Nd4 46. Rd5 Ne6 47. Ke3 Nf4 48. Ra5 Ng2+ 49.
