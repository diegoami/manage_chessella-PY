{After two draws at the
start Gelfand won his third round game against Demchenko. While that was
a tactical win, his fourth round victory against Lu Shanglei was more
positional in nature.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 dxc4 5. Bg2
c5 6. O-O Nc6 7. Qa4 Bd7 8. Qxc4 b5 9. Qc3 $5 {This move has been played
by Caruana at the Dortmund Super GM tournament in 2015. The idea seems
to be to stop Black from going c4.} (9. Qd3 {is the main move but then
Black has the option of directly playing c4.}) 9... cxd4 10. Nxd4 Nxd4
11. Qxd4 Rc8 12. Bf4 Bc5 13. Qd3 Qb6 14. Nd2 O-O 15. Ne4 {Until now the
players were following the game between Caruana and Naiditisch from Dortmund
2015. Here the German GM had played Nd5. But Lu Shanglei goes for an inferior
move.} Bc6 $6 { Voluntarily accepting kingside weakness doesn't seem to
be a great idea.} 16. Nxf6+ gxf6 17. Bxc6 Qxc6 18. Rfd1 Bb6 19. Rac1 Qb7
20. Rxc8 Rxc8 21. Bh6 $1 { We now understand why gxf6 was not such a good
idea. The back rank weakness is permanent and Black cannot so much about
it.} b4 22. e4 $1 {An important move which fixes the pawn on f6. If this
pawn cannot move then the pawn on f7 is immobile, and if those guys cannot
move then the king on g8 is trapped forever! } Kh8 23. Qd7 $5 {A very
interesting decision by Gelfand to go into the rook+bishop endgame. The
fact that Black had kingside weaknesses would have motivated many players
to keep the queens on the board, but Gelfand goes for simple play.} (23.

Qxd7 24. Rxd7 {White's advantage is beyond any doubt. Black's rook is
permanently nailed to the back rank and the king is trapped in the corner.
White on the other hand can play with all his forces. The only slightly
difficult task is to find the most appropriate way to break through.}

the rook exchange the white king comes to c4 and the b4 pawn falls. But
things are not so simple as Black tries to create counterplay on the kingside.
A quick initial analysis shows that White should win, but a deeper
investigation
may reveal something different.} Rxb8 31. Bxb8 axb3 32. axb3 Kg7 33. Ke2

Kc4 Rc6+ 40. Rc5 Be7 {It seems that leading upto the 40th move White has
lost the bulk of his advantage. But Gelfand shows that with the a5-b4-and
f6 pawns fixed on the same colour as the black bishop, the defence is
not at all trivial.} 41. Rxc6 Kxc6 42. f5 $1 {Fixing the f6 pawn.} Bd8

f6 or a5 pawn.} 1-0
