Bd7 {Here, I initally had seen Rb4, but after Qb4 Nf5+ Bxf5, I couldn't be
sure if Black wins. Around some point here, my opponent offered me a draw,
which receded into the background. Only Black can try here of course.Then I
thought I would play h5. Finally I decided to just give a couple of checks and
decide, when I suddenly saw that I had just a second. Before I could move and
press the clock, it turned to 0. Quite unbelievable.} 1-0
