placed on d5. Ding places it on the important diagonal before White can play
Ne5.} 14. Ne5  Bd5  15. Bc3  c5 $1  16. a5  Rc8 { [%emt 0:00:44] All very
simple and strong move.} 17. Ra4 $6  ( 17. dxc5 Bxc5 18. Na1 $5 $15) 17... cxd4

{[%emt 0:00:01] Black has not only the bishop pair, but also an extra pawn. He
is clearly better.} f6  23. Ng4  Bc5  24. Kf1  Ke7  25. Rab1  Rhd8  26. e4

everything.} 28. Rb4  Bb5  29. Ne3  c3+  30. Kf2  Rc6  31. Nc2  (31. Rc1 $15)
31... Rdc8  32. Na3 $2 {[%emt 0:00:44] A bad oversight by Wesley.} (32. Rc1 $17

{was the easiest way to win. The simple point being that White has absolutely
no moves. He cannot take the pawn on c2 because the h-pawn just queens.}) 40.

machine! He defends amazingly. Black has lost all his advantage now and a mate
is threatened on c8.} Kf8  48. Ra7  Rd8  49. Nxa6  Bd3+  50. Kg1  Rxe5  51. Rd1

ingenuity.} Rxh2  62. Ne1  Ke6  63. Rf4 $1  Rh1+  64. Kf2  Rh2+  65. Kg3  Re2
