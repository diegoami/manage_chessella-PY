1. e4 c5 2. c3 {Another rare guest at the top levels, but Gawain Jones is
nothing if not a connoisseur of anti-Sicilians.} Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5.
Bc4 (5. d4 {is marginally more popular, but has been largely de-fanged.}) 5...
Nb6 6. Bb3 c4 {Seizing control of c4 now gives White slightly fewer options
and makes clear that Black is playing for a win.} (6... d6 7. exd6 Qxd6 8. Na3
$5 {is an interesting idea, seen in a number of elite games. For instance,} Be6
9. d4 Bxb3 10. Qxb3 cxd4 11. Nb5 Qb8 12. Nbxd4 $36 {Nakamura,H-Nepomniachtchi,
I Baku 2015}) 7. Bc2 d6 8. exd6 Qxd6 (8... e5 $5 {is even more militantly
maximalist, but it is a bit unncessary and could come unstuck, e.g.} 9. a4 Bxd6
10. O-O Be6 11. d3 h6 12. a5 Nc8 13. a6 $14 {Howell,D-Lazarev,V France 2006})
9. O-O Bg4 10. h3 Bh5 11. Re1 O-O-O 12. Be4 {Discouraging all kinds of ...Qf6
ideas. This move has far more to it than meets the eye.} (12. b3 Qf6 13. bxc4
$132 {brings about an interesting imbalance}) (12. Na3 {could be another
implementation of the game idea:} Qf6 13. Be4 Ne5 14. g4 $132 {Vysochin,
S-Kokarev,D Olginka 2011}) 12... e6 (12... Qd7 $5 {might be a slight
improvement.} 13. b3 f5 14. Bxc6 (14. Bc2 e5 $17) 14... Qxc6 15. Qc2 $1 (15. g4
fxg4 16. Ne5 Qf6 17. hxg4 Be8 $132 {should practically favour Black}) 15...
Bxf3 16. Qxf5+ e6 17. Qxf3 Qxf3 18. gxf3 Rd3 $44 {Black has good compensation,
and practical chances based on White's exposed king, but I don't think he is
actually better.}) 13. b3 f5 14. Bc2 g6 15. bxc4 e5 16. d4 $6 (16. d3 {keeps
chances of a slight objective edge, although neither I nor the engine properly
understand Black's pawn sacrifice.}) 16... exd4 17. Bg5 Bg7 $1 {A really
powerful exchange sacrifice, which must have been underestimated.} (17... d3
18. Bb3 Be7 $11) 18. Bxd8 Rxd8 19. Qd3 Qf4 $17 {White finds it impossible to
disentangle because of the pressure on the long diagonal.} 20. Qd2 (20. Na3
dxc3 21. Qe3 {might have been a better wriggle}) 20... Qxd2 21. Nbxd2 dxc3 22.
Nb3 Bxf3 23. gxf3 Nb4 24. Re2 Nxc4 {Now Black has reached material parity, and
the difference in quality of pieces is obvious. Nevertheless, it is not so
clear how precisely Black should push the queenside pawns.} 25. Rc1 b5 26. Na1
Bh6 27. Rb1 a5 28. Kg2 Nd2 29. Rbe1 Bf4 {Fully under control. White can barely
move. The rest is just good (although not tricky) technique.} 30. Re7 Rd7 31.
Re8+ Kc7 32. Ra8 a4 33. Re6 Kb7 34. Rae8 Bd6 35. Bd1 Nd5 36. Re1 Nf4+ 37. Kh1
Bc5 38. Be2 Nxe2 39. R1xe2 b4 40. R2e5 Rc7 {The time control was reached and
despite still not being material down, there is precious little White can do
about ...b3 et cetera, so he resigned.} 0-1
