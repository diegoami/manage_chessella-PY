In this encounter we have former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik with a healthy +1 score, on the white side, and an out-of-shape but solid and strong Evgeny Tomashevsky on the black side. A few years ago, I used to consider Tomashevksy as "der Klein Kramnik" (a small Kramnik). However, his later developments and changes in style, plus Kramnik's own adjustments in style in recent years now seperate the two players' similarities.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 d5 3.

Nc4 {(#) Judgement time: White has a pair of bishops out of the opening. However, the closed and fixed nature of the center and his misplaced bishop on f3 do not give him much out of the opening. Just imagine what White could do if he had his bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal.} Qe6 14. Kg2 Nb6 15. Ne3 Rfd8 16. b3 Nc8 17. Bb2 Bd4 $6 {a small tactical inaccuracy.} 18. Rad1 {Yep, you cannot take on b2, sir!} Nd6 $5 {An interesting approach to solve his problem. Tomashevsky decides to go through a number of exchanges which will result in a slightly worse, but possibly manageable endgame.} (18... Nb6 19. Bc1 g6 20.

Qe5 Qxe5 29. Nxe5 Rb2 {(#) After a series of more or less forced moves, we have reached an endgame in which White is a pawn up alloowing him to secure a long-term advantage by exchanging the b3 pawn for f7. Nevertheless, due to the drawish nature of these three-against-two pawn endings, Kramnik decides to shake up the game just a little bit.} 30. Bd1 Nd5 $6 {Tomashevsky plays with fire.} 31. Nc4 Ra2 32.

Kh3 {(#) This is the only move which keeps White's hopes alive. White moves his king in vain but the idea is in fact to keep the king out it! The rook and knight will take care of the material advantage but it is not clear whether that is enough either.} g4+ (49...Rb2 50. f3 Rb3 51. Ra5 Rxf3 52. Rxg5+ Kh8 53. Rc5 Kg7) 50.

Black has created a fortress with his king and knight and by keeping his rooks active, he has simplified his defensive tasks.} 61. Ne3 Ra4 62. Ke2 Ra3 63. Rc5 Rb3 64. Nd5+ Kg7 65. Nc3 Rb6 66.
