fxe3 Nxb3 40. Kf2 {Diagram [#] Is this position objectively winning for Black?
Maybe not. What is useful for the practical player is to see how Tomashevsky
makes use of his chances and step by step strengthens his position. His plan
can be broken up into the following points. 1. Centralize the king. 2.
Centralize the knight. 3. Look out for tactical chances. 4. Keep posing micro
problems to the opponent.} Nc5 41. Kf3 f6 $1 {This move gets starts the journey
of centralizing the king.} 42. g4 Kf7 43. h4 e5 44. e4 Ke6 {Step one achieved
the king has been centralized. The next step now is to centralize the knight.}
45. Ke3 Kd7 46. Nb4 Kd6 47. Kf3 Nb3 $1 48. Ke3 Nd4 {The knight is well placed.
Of course if White were careful now it would not be so easy to make progress.
But he makes an error and we see how alert the Russian is.} 49. Nd5 f5 $1 50.
gxf5 (50. g5 {was better.}) 50... Nxf5+ $5 (50... gxf5 {was also interesting,
the point being that we could create a protected passed pawn with f5-f4+.}) 51.

Ke3 Kf6 58. Nf3 Nf7 59. Nh2 $2 {The losing mistake of the game. Some may blame
just this move for White's loss, but I think it is the persistent pressure put
on by Tomashevsky which resulted in Sanal making his final mistake.} g5 $1 {The
power of this move is not so easy to understand.} 60. hxg5+ Kxg5 $1 {Black is
winning unconditionally, mainly because his king goes to h3 and then the knight
joins in, after which there is no way to stop the h-pawn.} 61. Kf3 Kh4 62. Kf2
Kh3 63. Nf1 Ng5 64. Ng3 Kg4 {h4 is coming up and the e4 pawn will fall. Sanal
threw in the towel. A masterful endgame show by the Russian Champion.} 0-1
