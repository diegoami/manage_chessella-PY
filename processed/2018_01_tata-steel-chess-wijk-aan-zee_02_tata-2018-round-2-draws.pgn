good place for both sides to show class as they lead to long and yet

as good as he gets in complex positions.} Na6 8. g4 Nc5 9. f3 h5 $5 $146 {

moves are played.} 16. Rab1 h6 {The computer disagrees, but this move is
completely the right one from a schematic point of view. Black would like to
play ...Re7 but right now there is an issue with the back rank, therefore he
solves it and then plays ...Re7.} (16... Nd4 17. Bxd4 exd4 18. Rxd4 Be6 19.
