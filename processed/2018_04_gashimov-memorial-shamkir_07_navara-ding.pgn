1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. a3
{This has always been a poor relation of the main moves, of which the most
principled remains 8.c3, in spite of allowing the Marshall Gambit.} d6 {
The most principled and popular move.} (8... Bc5 $5 {creates a strange
impression but has been chosen by Aronian; it makes sense in that in the
Arkhangelsk variation White would typically like to play a4, and in this case
Black will regain his tempo and rejoin main lines.} 9. c3 Bb6 10. d4 Re8 $1 {
and now the Aronian game continued:} 11. Bg5 d6 12. Qd3 Na5 13. Bd5 c6 14. Ba2
c5 $5 15. dxc5 dxc5 16. Qxd8 Rxd8 17. b4 Nb7 18. c4 (18. Nxe5 c4 $132 {is of
course the key test, but I think Black has enough here.}) 18... bxc4 19. Bxc4
cxb4 20. axb4 {Here the game Grischuk,A-Aronian,L Sharjah 2017 was agreed
drawn; one possible continuation is} h6 21. Bxf6 gxf6 22. Rxa6 Rxa6 23. Bxa6
Nd6 $44 {and it would be hard to fault White for believing the compensation
here.}) 9. c3 Na5 10. Ba2 c5 11. d4 $6 {White's sole idea in this variation
was to keep the light-squared bishop on a more active diagonal. After the text,
Black has a completely logical reply, which negates this gain and leaves White
objectively suffering.} (11. b4 $5 {is interesting here.} Nc6 12. d3 (12. d4 $2
exd4 13. cxd4 Bg4 $15) 12... Be6 13. Bxe6 fxe6 14. Nbd2 $13 {Here the
pawn-structure does not make it clear who should be playing for what, or where.
The position is about equal, but the player who finds even a marginally better
plan will find himself with a better position in no time.}) 11... c4 $1 {
Black lays claim to a small edge at this point. From here on in, Ding Liren
demonstrates some really crisp and clean chess.} (11... Qc7 12. b4 cxb4 13.
axb4 Nc4 14. Nbd2 {may also be playable, but it gives White some of what he
wants.}) 12. Bg5 (12. dxe5 $2 dxe5 13. Qxd8 Rxd8 14. Nxe5 {is obviously not
free, due to} Nxe4 15. Nf3 $6 Nc5 $3 $17) 12... h6 13. Bh4 Bg4 (13... Nh5 $15 {
is the most thematic move, and after this too Black seems to be marginally
better already.}) 14. h3 Bxf3 15. Qxf3 Nc6 16. d5 Na5 17. Bxf6 (17. Bg3 Nd7 18.
Nd2 Nc5 $15 {is not encouraging}) 17... Bxf6 18. Nd2 Bg5 19. Nf1 g6 {Alongside
White's numerous objective problems is the stylistic one that Black's moves
suggest themselves immediately. Some cosmetic improvements on the kingside, a
bit of 'hinting' at the idea of ...f5, and then the inevitable breakthrough
with ...b4.} 20. a4 Qe7 21. Bb1 Nb3 22. Ra2 Nc5 23. Bc2 Rfb8 24. g3 h5 25. h4
Bh6 {All according to plan. White had no active alternatives.} 26. axb5 axb5
27. Rea1 Rxa2 28. Rxa2 Kg7 29. Qe2 Rb7 30. Qe1 Qc7 31. Kg2 Qb6 {It was never
going to be possible to hold back ...b4 in the long term, not least because
the c2-bishop needs to stay where it is to prevent immediate incursions by the
Black knight (thus, White never has Ne3-c2-b4.) One thing that is, however,
slightly surprising is that White crumbles in a further 5 moves.} 32. Kf3 $2 {
Maybe White was trying for g4, or maybe the king was just wandering to e2 via
the front route. We shall never know, because on the next move it went
straight back.} Rc7 {Still thinking of ...Nd3, but possibly in conjunction
with ...Rc4 after the pawn has vacated that square.} (32... Nd3 33. Bxd3 cxd3
34. Qd1 f5 {was the engine solution, relying on ...Rf7 ideas like} 35. Qxd3 $2
fxe4+ 36. Qxe4 Rf7+ $19) 33. Kg2 $2 (33. Qd1 b4 34. cxb4 Qxb4 35. Kg2 $17 {
was possible and Black still needs to find an idea that doesn't simplify too
much}) 33... b4 {Now Ding finishes crisply.} 34. cxb4 Nd3 35. Bxd3 cxd3 {
Both ...Rc1 and ...Rc2 are extremely dangerous threats and White has no answer
to both.} 36. Ra1 (36. Qd1 Rc2 37. Qf3 d2 $19) 36... Rc2 0-1
