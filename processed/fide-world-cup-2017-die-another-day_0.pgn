similar position to the game where instead of c6, Bb4 is played, which is of
course an improvement for Black.}) 2. c4  e6  3. Nf3  d5  4. Nc3  Bb4 {[%emt
0:00:06] Going for the Ragozin.} 5. Bg5  dxc4 {[%emt 0:00:11] This was the same
line that Wesley So played against DIng Liren in their tiebreak and the game
was drawn in just six moves.} 6. e4  (6. a3 {was played by Ding Liren and

Bxf6  Qxf6  8. Bxc4 {[%emt 0:00:04] I would already feel that White has a very
good position. Black has to do something with a break in the centre or else the
centre is just too strong.} c5  (8... Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 Qg6 10. Qe2 Qxg2 11. Rg1

11. Ne4  cxd4  12. Qe2 $5 {[%emt 0:00:10] This is the more ambitious way of
playing for White. He hopes to put his rook on d1 and then win the d4 pawn. In
any case, even if he doesn't win the d4 pawn, he would like to launch a
kingside attack with Ng3 Bd3 and the king on g8 is already feeling the heat.}

10] Ding already thought for nine minutes which meant that he was out of his
preparation. This move along with his next do not go well together. If he
wanted to launch an attack on kingside with Ng3 - Bd3 and so on like
Mamedyarov, the rook is doing absolutely nothing on d1.} (13. Bd3 Nc6 14. Ng3)

kingside attack.} (14. a3 Be7 15. b4 (15. Rac1) 15... Qb8 16. Ng3 b5 17. Bxb5

your knight immediately to the kingside then d4 can be taken by the rook.}

strong attack.}) 15. a3 {[%emt 0:10:51] This move was played predominantly to
stop Black's ideas related to Nb4 after White plays Bd3.} (15. Bd3 Nb4 $1)
15... Ne7 $1 {[%emt 0:07:34] An excellent idea which is an extremely important
one. The knight is beautifully placed on g6. From there it attacks the e5 pawn,
but that it did from c6 as well. The more important function is that it defends
Black's king position and threatens jumps like Nf4 and Nh4. Also it frees the
space for the bishop to come to c6.} 16. Ne4  (16. b4 Bb6 17. Nxd4 Ng6 $15

bolster it with f4.}) (16. Nxd4 $6 Qb6 $1 17. Nf3 (17. Nb3 Ba4 18. Nxc5 Bxd1

unable to use the e4 square, this will lead to a position where White has many

very solid play by Aronian.} 18. Qh5  (18. Nf3 Qc7 $15) (18. Nd6 {might look
like a strong move but it fails to} Qg5 $1 19. Nf3 Qh5 $17 {The queen is well
placed, bishop is coming to c6 and the knight is jumping to f4.}) 18... Qh4 $1
{[%emt 0:01:11] This was the move that Ding Liren had missed. Now the queen
exchange is forced, after which the weak e5 pawn and Black's bishop pair give
him a very substantial edge.} 19. Qxh4  Nxh4 {[%emt 0:00:05] I was sitting in
the press room discussing this position with IM Beglar Jobava (Baadur's
brother). At first we did not think White has so many difficulties, but the
more we analyzed the more we realized that the only way for White to hold the
balance is to give up a pawn and aim for activity. After the game Ding Liren
also said the same — he was looking to give up a pawn, but in return exchange
one of Black's bishops.} 20. a4 $5  (20. Bb5 Bxd4 21. Bxd7 Bxb2 22. Rab1 Bxe5

0:04:12] At this point everyone started to get really excited about Levon's
chances. His plan is simple get the king on f8-e7 and then Rd8, swap a pair of
rooks and the rest is easy. However, Ding had some other plans in his mind.}
28. h4 $1 {[%emt 0:00:08] The idea of this move is clear once it is made — to
play h5 and to fix a weakness on g7 which can be attacked with the rook coming
to g4. However, it is not so easy to find the move at first instance.} (28. Be2

this would have been the best way to continue. Concrete variations might not be
necessary here. The main point is that h5 is met with g5, and there is no
weakness on g7. That's the reason why g6 looks good.}) (28... h5 {could also be

stalled for the time being as the g7 pawn is hanging. At this point it could
have been a good idea to give up the g7 pawn and just activate the rook.} Rg8

extra pawn, this might not really be the best idea.} (30... Rd8 $1 31. Rxd8

the pressure could have been a good idea.}) (39. g3 {Slowly improving the
position is how many people would have played this position.Get the king to g2
