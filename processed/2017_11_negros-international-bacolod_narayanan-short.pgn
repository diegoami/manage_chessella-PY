{I was quite excited to play against Nigel in an encounter with the first
prize at stake. Nigel is a player with vast experience, a legend I've looked
up to since my childhood. A year before I was born, Nigel was already
competing for the World Chess Championship title.} 1. e4 e5 {In recent times,
Nigel has largely been alternating between the French and 1...e5. e5 is
probably a more solid choice considering the situation, with less concrete
lines. However, it could well have been a choice at random.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4
{I thought this was an innocuous opening choice. However, the Italian has been the
opening in fashion in recent times, and the vast amount of games at the top
level and the time spent here has led to the revealing of a lot of intricacies.
It's amazing how rich chess can be.} Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 {This is already an
interesting position. Black has to make a choice about the precise setup he
wants to go to.} a6 {About 12 years ago GM Maxim Sorokin, explained to me how
this was the best setup for Black against the Italian. Back then, almost no
one went for the setup directly with ...d5 after early 0-0. Back then, it was
also very uncommon for either side to play a4 or a5. In the present
situation, this is not so clear. The drawback of playing a6 so quickly is that,
Black already commits and doesn't have the option of ...a5 anymore. Having
said that, it's not really clear to me what's the 'best' setup. The position
is extremely rich and fascinating, and the jury is still out.} (5... O-O {
is probably more fashionable, trying to keep the option open for a direct d5.})
6. a4 {trying to be non commital as long as possible.} d6 7. c3 {I wanted to
refrain from this move to keep the option open for Nc3 related setups in case
I go Bg5. However, Black still hasn't castled and I had to make an useful move.
} (7. h3 h6 {[%cal Gg7g5,Gg5g4] is a mistake I've commited more than once.
Usually it's safe to play h3 only after Black has castled.}) 7... Ba7 8. Na3 $5
{I played this after a 12 minute thought. White has a choice between numerous
setups here.} O-O (8... Ne7 {was the system preferred by Giri, who is probably
among the foremost opening experts in the world.} 9. Bg5 c6 10. Nc2 O-O 11. Nh4

game can go.}) 9. Bg5 h6 10. Bh4 {White probably has a pull here. Black is
forced to play g5 at some point to disentangle from this pin.} Qe7 (10... g5

point, the typical way to play in such positions with g5. The point is that,
Black should aim to get f5.} 15. Ne3 Bxe3 16. Rxe3 Ng7 {[%cal Gf7f5]} 17. Bd5

White is better. While most GM's I discussed this position with thought that
the g3 bishop was bad, the nuances in this position go much deeper than that.}

place square to control. Black can't quite mitigate this with f5, as opening
the position only favours White's bishops.} Be6 20. Be1 {The starting of a
manouvere, aiming to shift the f3 knight to g3.} c4 (20... f5 21. exf5 Bxf5 22.

White's dark square bishop will be transformed.}) 21. d4 f6 22. Nh2 Nb6 {
As Black cannot play f5 anymore, the kingside is White's for the taking. Black
has to try to get counter-play on the queenside. A tense period of battle
ensued with both players having limited time. Therefore, I am not going to be
too critical on the subtle mistakes.} 23. Rf2 Nb3 24. Rb1 bxa4 {My opponent
followed this move with a draw offer.} (24... Nxa4 25. Nf1 g4 26. hxg4 Rg8 {

I had achieved the setup I intended. But now what? With just 8 minutes
remaining, I wasn't really sure how to proceed, which way to play.} Rd7 30. Bd1
(30. Nh5 Rdf7 31. g4 {is Stockfish's top chouice. I was tempted by this as
well, but I was also scared at the same time, as this closes everything. How
will White make progress? White has the h4 break, but I couldn't see a clear
way. In hindsight, this makes more sense, especially with the time situation.
White improves his position easily with Rf3,R1f2,Kf1-e1-d1. After this he can
play h4 at an opportune movement. Black cannot show the same flexibility with
limited space. Black of course has counter-play} Na8 32. Rf3 Nc7 33. R1f2 Bd7 {
