1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e3 Bb4 5. Qc2 Bxc3 (5... O-O 6. Nd5 Re8 {
was seen in online battles between Nepo and Karjakin, Chess.com 2017}) 6. Qxc3
Qe7 7. b3 $5 {White wastes no time deploying his prized DSB.} (7. Be2 d5 8. d4
exd4 9. Nxd4 Nxd4 10. Qxd4 c5 11. Qh4 dxc4 {equal, in Giri-Aronian, 2017}) 7...
O-O ({Now} 7... d5 8. d4 exd4 9. Nxd4 {is slightly better for White:} Nxd4 10.
Qxd4 c5 11. Qf4 O-O 12. Bb2 d4 13. Bd3 dxe3 14. fxe3 Re8 15. O-O-O {etc.}) 8.
Bb2 Re8 9. a3 a5 10. h3 {[#]} b6 $6 {This appears to be a rather artificial
attempt to complicate matters, which is totally uncharacteristic of Karjakin's
style. Perhaps Sergey was looking to build up on his success from the day
before. Chesswise, it's hard to see any prospects for the bishop blocked by
its own knight.} (10... Ne4 11. Qc2 Nc5 {would be a logical follow-up to the
a7-a5 move.}) ({Else, it's never too late to return to the classical,
center-oriented approach} 10... d5 {as now} 11. d4 $6 Ne4 12. Qd3 exd4 13. Nxd4
dxc4 14. bxc4 {hands the initiative over to Black who has ways of exploiting
White's lack of K-side development,} Qg5 ({or even} 14... Ra6)) 11. Be2 Bb7 12.
O-O d5 $2 {How can Black expect this to work together with the fianchettoed
bishop is beyond me.} (12... Ne4 13. Qc2 Nc5 {was still the best option,
hoping for} 14. d4 $2 exd4 15. Nxd4 Nxd4 16. Bxd4 Qe4 $15 {where the weakness
on b3 is telling.}) 13. cxd5 Nxd5 14. Qc2 e4 {Understandable.} (14... Rad8 15.
Bb5 Rd6 {holds it together, but what does Black do next, after} 16. d3) 15. Nh2
Qg5 {[#]} 16. f4 ({Even better was} 16. f3 {to exclude the option outlined in
the next note.}) 16... exf3 ({Many would prefer to keep the strong e4-pawn:} 
16... Qh4 17. Bb5 Re6 18. Rf2 $14) 17. Nxf3 Qg3 18. Rf2 Rad8 19. Bc4 {Who
needs to occupy the center with pawns when you can have unobstructed bishops
like this? This position looks like a dream Reti.} Nf6 {A tough decision, the
kind we have come to expect from the Minister of Defense Sergey Karjakin.} 20.
Bxf6 gxf6 21. Raf1 Rd6 22. b4 axb4 23. axb4 Re7 24. b5 Ne5 {[#]} 25. Nd4 {
Fabiano wants to keep the tension.} (25. Nxe5 Qxe5 (25... Rxe5 26. Bxf7+) 26.
Bd3 {looks good for White, but one can never be sure about the outcome of a
possible rook endgame,} Be4 27. Bxe4 Qxe4 28. Qxe4 Rxe4 29. Rxf6 Rxd2 30. Rxf7
Rc2 {etc.}) 25... Bc8 26. Kh1 Kg7 ({Desperate times call for desperate
measures, therefore} 26... f5 {was worth investigating. At least there's a
chance for} 27. Nxf5 Bxf5 28. Rxf5 Nxc4 29. Qxc4 Rxd2) 27. Be2 Kh8 {A sad
sight of Karjakin being reduced to mere waiting moves.} 28. Qc3 Kg7 29. Bd1 Kg8
30. Bc2 Qh4 31. Rf4 Qg3 32. Bf5 Bb7 33. Be4 Bc8 34. Qa3 Kg7 35. Qa8 $1 {
[#] This is curtains, as Black is unable to maintain control over the
f5-square.} Bxh3 (35... Bd7 36. Bf5) (35... Re8 36. Qxc8 Rxc8 37. Nf5+) 36.
