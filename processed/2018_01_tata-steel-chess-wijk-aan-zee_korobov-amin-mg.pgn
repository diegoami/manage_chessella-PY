9. Qd2 exd5 10. cxd5 {These extremely complex positions formally belong to the
Modern Benoni but are more important for the King's Indian (where Black's plan
...c5 is considered nowadays to be the most principled answer to Samisch
System) and they more often arise, as in the featured game, through the King's
Indian move order.} a6 {Other important options are ...Re8 and ...h5.} 11. a4 (
11. Bxh6 {is answered by} Nxe4 $1 {followed by ...Qh4+}) 11... h5 {Now the
fight intersects also with lines where White plays Be3 (instead of Bg5, Be3)
while Black, respectively, plays ...h7-h5 in one move (instead of ...h6, ...h5)
. Such nuances do not make the opening preparation easier but players have to
know them.} ({Note that Kasparov in his games preferred} 11... Re8 12. Nge2 ({
less common is} 12. Be2 $5) 12... Nbd7) ({While an immediate} 11... Nbd7 $6 {
allows} 12. Nh3 $1) 12. Nge2 {Deviations for White include 12.a5!? and 12.
Bh6!?.} Nbd7 $1 13. Nc1 ({White has to rearrange his minor pieces. Another
quite often played move is} 13. Nd1 {, planning Nec3 and Nf2.}) ({One more
option is} 13. Nf4) 13... Ne5 14. Be2 Nh7 {Again Black had a choice, between
this move and 14...Re8, 14...h4.} 15. h3 {Still not new, but at least little
explored. White makes sure that, after the possible further f4, the g4 square
will not be available for the black knight. Still, White is not really
planning to play f4 on the next move (for example, after ...Re8), because his
e4 pawn will become vulnerable after the retreat ...Nd7.} f5 $5 16. f4 {But
now it's a different story. Or, at least, Korobov so decided.} Nf7 17. exf5 ({
Previously,} 17. Nd3 $5 Re8 18. Nf2 {had been seen in practice.}) 17... gxf5 $6
({After} 17... Bxf5 $1 {Amin possibly disliked} 18. g4 {, otherwise it's hard
to understand his decision. But Black is apparently doing very well because
White is underdeveloped:} Bd7 {and, for example,} 19. Nd3 Qe7 20. O-O-O $2 {
just loses a piece:} Rae8 21. Bf2 Bxc3 $19 {. While after the game move White
is at least somewhat better.}) 18. O-O Nf6 19. Bf2 Bd7 20. a5 Bb5 $6 ({Black
could have tried} 20... Nh8 21. Bh4 Ng6 22. Bg5 ({White can also accept the
pawn sacrifice,} 22. Bxf6 $5 Qxf6 23. Bxh5) 22... h4) 21. Re1 Re8 22. Qc2 Qd7
23. Bf3 Rxe1+ 24. Bxe1 Re8 25. N1e2 Ng4 $5 {In a worse for him position Black
is trying to complicate matters.} 26. Nxb5 $5 axb5 ({Worthy of attention was} 
26... Ne3 $5) 27. Bc3 $5 Nfh6 $6 ({Again} 27... Ne3 {could have been a better
chance.}) 28. Ng3 $1 Bxc3 29. Qxc3 b4 30. Qd2 h4 31. hxg4 $2 {After Black's
principally wrong decision on the 17th move Korobov gradually outplayed his
opponent, but now White goes astray, underestimating dangers for his king,} ({
Correct was a calm} 31. Nf1 $1 {and if} Nf6 32. Qf2 {, winning the h4 pawn.})
31... hxg3 32. g5 Qg7 $1 33. Bh5 $2 ({White still could have achieved a draw
with precise play:} 33. Kf1 $1 {(planning Re1, which could not have been
played immediately because of 33...Qd4+!!)} Ng4 34. Bxg4 fxg4 35. Re1 $1 Rf8 $1

Rh7 or} Kg7 42. Rd1 $1 {and after} d5 {another pawn can be attacked:} 43. Rc1)
33... Nf7 $1 {The g3 pawn is like a splinter in White's position. Black's main
threat now is ...Qh8! and White should do something about this...} 34. Qd3 (34.
Re1 {still loses to} Qd4+ $1) 34... Qxb2 $1 35. Bxf7+ ({White is lost also
after} 35. Rf1 Qh8 $1 36. Bxf7+ Kxf7 $1 37. Qxf5+ Ke7 $1 38. Qe6+ ({or} 38.
