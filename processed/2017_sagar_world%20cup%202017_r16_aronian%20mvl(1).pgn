{If I had to choose someone between the two, it would be MVL. Not by a big
margin, but I do think that this format somehow suits him better. But, and
this is a big but, Levon with the white pieces is a very dangerous opening
theoretician. He always has new ideas up his sleeve. MVL has to be careful.} 1.

can expect the Grunfeld.} 4. cxd5 {[%emt 0:00:00]} Nxd5 {[%emt 0:00:03]} 5. e4

Whenever this move is played, I have a feeling that the players will blitz out
their moves and will agree to a draw somewhere around the 30th move mark! Well,
if Levon is playing at such an important moment in the tournament, he surely
has something prepared.} O-O {[%emt 0:00:26]} 9. Be2 {[%emt 0:00:04]} cxd4 {

23. Rfd1 {[%emt 0:00:19]} Bf8 {[%emt 0:00:21]} 24. Rbc1 {[%emt 0:05:34] The
first new move of the game. And a good moment to take stock of things. What do
you think is happening. Well we could just take into consideration that both
near to 2800 players are playing at lightning speed and they are very well
prepared, so it should be a draw. But if we keep this aside, I think it is an
interesting position to analyze. The move Bf8, clearly points that Black would
like to put his pawn on a5 and bishop on c5. Once he gets that he shouldn't
really be worse. White's only chances are attached to his rooks penetrating
into Black's position. I would say that the position is balanced with Black
really having nothing much to worry.} (24. Rd4 Qe6 25. Qb3 Qxb3 26. Rxb3 Bc5

[%emt 0:09:22]} 25. Qc3 $5 {[%emt 0:02:38] A very interesting decision by
Aronian. He realizes that exchanging the queen will in all probability lead to
a draw, so he keeps the queen and his clock still shows 1:29:59, which means
this is his preparation. But as many people said after the game, they
absolutely did not understand what Aronian's preparation was all about. He
just landed in a position where White has no real chances to win.} (25. Qxe4

be met with Re2.} 28. Kh1 $1 {[%emt 0:01:07] A nice move by Levon. Now taking
the f2 pawn will lead to a rook coming on f1 and attacking the f7 pawn.} Bxf2 {

defended by the rook. The b6 point, by the bishop, so in short there is no
real problem for Black. Levon realized this and offered a draw.} 1/2-1/2
