this well-trodden line in the Maroczy.} ({Black has also tried to prevent
White's idea by playing} 12... a5 {himself, but this just left too many
concessions on the light squares.} 13. Nb5 Bd7 14. Bxd4 Bxb5 15. Be3 Bc6 16. f3

there are plenty of choices here. Personally 13...f5 seemed like the natural
choice.} 14. Qa4 {An interesting choice. White clearly feels the endgame favors
him enough to invite it. This was by no means an unspoken draw offer.} Qxa4
{White is slightly better.} 15. Rxa4 Rfc8 16. Nd5 Bxd5 17. exd5 $5 { White's
plan is now made clear: he wishes to use his rook and bishop pair to push forth
his new 4 vs 3 pawn majority on the queenside.} Re8 18. Re1 f5 19. Kf1 Kf7 20.
b4 Rac8 21. Rc1 e4 22. Be2 Be5 23. g3 {Though there is nothing decisive yet,
Black is having trouble drumming up counterplay. His logical means would be to
push his own center and kingside pawns, but they are all tied down due to
threats.} Rc7 {[#] Black overlooks white's next shot.} 24. c5 $1 Rec8 (24...

instead of becoming a threat, the knight has become a liability.} ) 26. Kxe2

passed pawn, and Black's two passers, supported by his king, are too strong for
just the king or just the bishop.} 35. Bb3 f4+ 36. gxf4+ gxf4+ 37. Ke2 Kd4 38.

point of White's line: the Bd4 will be lost.} 30. Rxd4 $1 cxd4 31. Rxc8 Rxb6

the 8th, trying to keep White's bishop pinned, which leaves White's rook free
