        Bg2 e6 4. O-O Be7 5. d3 O-O 6. Nbd2 c5 7. e4 Nc6 8. Re1 Qc7 (8... b5 {Going 
        ahead with queenside counterplay is much more popular. The move Qc7 is 
        the second most played move.}) 9. Qe2 {Nakamura's previous move seemed 
        to come as a surprise for Giri, who was now out of home preparation.} 
        ( 9. e5 Nd7 10. Qe2 b5 {is one of the main lines.}) 9... b5 10. a4 $5 
        b4 11. exd5 exd5 (11... Nxd5 {gives up the square on c4.} 12. Nc4 {[%csl 
        Gc4]}) 12. Nb3 Re8 13. Bf4 Qb6 14. a5 Qb5 15. Qd2 Be6 {Black has developed 
        all his pieces and has good control over the center. Nakamura has equalized 
        out of the opening. But Giri was not looking for an opening edge when 
        he started with the King's Indian Attack, just an original game of chess.} 
        16. a6 Bf8 (16... Rad8 $5) 17. Ne5 Nxe5 18. Bxe5 Nd7 19. Bf4 Qb6 20. c3

        c4 26. Nxc4 Bxc4 27. dxc4 Nc5 28. Be3 Qg6 $11 {This could have been a 
        very fine position for Black.}) 25. Qxc3 {Black has to remain slightly 
        careful here as the white knight has a beautiful square on c4.} Nf6 26. 
        Nc4 Qd8 27. Bb7 $1 {Before Black can block the diagonal with Nd5, White 
        gets his bishop to b7. Things start to become uncomfortable for Black.} 
        Nd5 28. Qd2 Nxf4 29. Qxf4 Qxd3 (29... Rc7 30. Rab1 $14 {You can feel Nakamura's 
        cramped position over here and hence in the game he logically tries to 
        break free.}) 30. Ne5 Qd6 31. Rad1 Qc7 32. Nc6 $1 {A beautiful move attacking 
        the a7 pawn. Nakamura saw nothing better than to sacrifice his queen. 
        In any case his position is quite precarious.} Qxc6 ({Exchanging the queens 
        doesn't ease the defensive task.} 32... Qxf4 33. gxf4 Rxc6 (33... Rc7 
        34. f5 $1 Bd7 35. Rxe8 Bxe8 36. Nxa7 $18) 34. Bxc6 Rb8 35. Bd5 $16) 33. 
        Bxc6 Rxc6 34. Qa4 Rec8 {Two bishops is not enough compensation for the 
        queen.} 35. Rd8 $1 c4 36. Rxc8 Rxc8 37. Rxe6 $1 {Anish finds the quickest 
        way to end the game.} fxe6 38. Qd7 Rc5 39. Qxe6+ Kh7 40. Qf7 Bd6 41. h5
