42. Rxb5 $2 {Impatience
is often the root cause for all the misery! Khalifman misses the cute
little trick that Yuffa had prepared.} (42. Kd3 Rb7 43. Kd4 Rc7 44. Rxb5
Rb7 45. Kc5 $18 {wins easily.}) 42... Rb7 $1 {Stalemate is the theme!}
43. Rxb7 {Khalifman was so dejected that he didn't even try playing the
3 vs 2 endgame. Of course that is easily drawn. Instead he chooses to
stalemate his opponent.} 1/2-1/2
