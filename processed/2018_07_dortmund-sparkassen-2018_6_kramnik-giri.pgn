{Kramnik who had the White pieces today was no doubt looking to bounce back
with a win after a rather disappointing loss in the previous round.} 1. Nf3 d5
2. e3 Nf6 3. d4 c5 4. Nbd2 {As we have seen many times before, Kramnik decides
to choose a modest opening setup without delving into deep theory and try to
outplay his opponent from an equal middlegame position.} e6 5. b3 cxd4 6. exd4
Bb4 $5 {I like this move and it wouldn't surprise me at all if Giri had
prepared this beforehand. Previously Vlad played this line twice in Zuerich
scoring 1.5/2 but has never faced 6...Bb4. The idea is to immediately stifle
White's development and threaten either Bc3 or Ne4-c3.} (6... Nc6 7. Bb2 g6 8.

strategically speaking this makes sense} 10. Bxc3 Nxc3 11. Qe1 Nb4 $1 $146 {
it seems as though Black is taking liberties chasing after the White bishop
but with the centre closed he is in no danger of being attacked. Indeed the
engine gives absolutely no advantage for White at all after this move, making
me think that this is more likely to be home prep than not.} (11... Qb6 12. Qe3

after a little knight tour it is clear that White has achieved zero advantage
from the opening. Maybe Giri was even getting slightly optimistic that he
could apply some pressure on the White position, especially down the c-file.}

provoking Black into taking material.} Qxc4 $6 {it's difficult to overly
criticise this move but it does seem to give White an easy route to equality.
Better was} (24... Be8 $5 {or}) (24... h6 $5 {maintaining some tension and
forcing White to find more precise moves.}) 25. Qxc4 Rxc4 26. dxe6 fxe6 27. Rd3

to very drawish endings.} e5 {Black is pretty much forced to return material
