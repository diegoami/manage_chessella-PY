Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. g3 Be7 5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O dxc4 {Yifan has traditionally never been scared of going for solid lines, such as the open Catalan.} 7. Qc2 a6 8. Qxc4 b5 9. Qc2 Bb7 10. Bf4 (10. Bd2 {has volumes of theory dedicated to it, and 10.Bg5 is also popular, but Bf4 will always remain a try. It is completely out of fashion, however.}) 10... Nc6 11. Nc3 Nb4 12. Qc1 Qc8 {Interestingly, this move is already a novelty. Perhaps Yifan wasn't aware of the old theory, but I doubt that this move will make replace the more common and already tested 12...Rc8} (12... Rc8 13. Rd1 Nbd5 14. Nxd5 Bxd5 { eventually led to an Anand win in Carlsen-Anand, 2008.}) 13. a3 Nbd5 14. Nxd5 Nxd5 (14... Bxd5 15. Qxc7 {doesn't work anymore, clearly.}) 15. Bg5 {Short finds a way to keep pressure. Now Black cannot play c5, which is mildly annoying, and trading the dark-squared bishops is strategically bad.} f6 16. Bd2 c5 {Black plays her break, but because of the weakness of e6 this doesn't equalize fully.} 17. Ba5 f5 (17... cxd4 18. Nxd4 {already creates problems on e6.}) 18. dxc5 Qxc5 $6 {this makes life a lot easier for Short, as we will see soon} (18... Bxc5 19. Qd2 {keeps an edge.}) 19. Qxc5 Bxc5 20. Ng5 {If only that pawn was back on f7...} Rfe8 21. Rad1 {Here is the rub. Defending the knight on d5 is not as trivial as it seems. The bishop on a5 defends d8, while the knight on g5 is threatening to take on the next move. Black loses a pawn in every variation, now she must choose how to do it.} Ba7 $6 22. Nxe6 { A bit rushed.} (22. e3 $1 {Eliminates the problems with the e2 pawn, and now the win of the pawn is cleaner than in the game.}) 22... Rxe6 23. Rxd5 Rxe2 24. Bc3 {Short must have seen this far, realized he is winning a pawn, and felt he had enough to convert. However the rook on e2 is a bit annoying.} Bc6 $1 { The best way to continue survival. The bishop covers d7.} 25. Rxf5 Bxg2 26. Kxg2 Rf8 $6 (26... Rd8 {was another try, but this is obviously unpleasant.}) 27. Rxf8+ Kxf8 28. Kf3 $1 Rc2 29. Ke4 $1 {Nice technique. The bishop endgame is hopeless, so f2 is untouchable.} Re2+ (29... Rxf2 30. Rxf2+ Bxf2 31. Bd4 $1 Be1 32. Kd5 {and the pawns on the queenside fall like flies.}) (29... Bxf2 30. Kd3 $18) 30. Kd5 Kf7 31. Kc6 Re6+ 32. Kb7 $1 {The king march is complete. On b7 White's king paralyzes the enemy rook and is completely safe. The rest is easy for Nigel.} Bc5 33. Rd1 g5 34. Rd5 Be7 35. f4 gxf4 36. gxf4 Rh6 37. f5 Rxh2 38. Kxa6 Rc2 39. Rd7 Ke8 40. Rd2 Rxd2 41. Bxd2 h5 42. Kxb5 {Three passed pawns usually beat one.} h4 43. Kc6 Bf6 44. b4 Be5 45. Be3 h3 46. Bg1 Kf7 47. a4 Kf6 48. a5 Kxf5 49. a6 Bd4 50. Bh2 {Black is helpless against b4-b5, while playing Be5 loses.} (50. Bh2 Be5 51. a7) 1-0
