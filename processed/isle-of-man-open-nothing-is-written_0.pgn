1. Nf3 b6 $5 {when I became a GM, 1...b6 was considered a dubious move against
almost all of White's decent choices (1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, 1.c4). So far, I have
eliminated the last two from the list of good choices to prevent 1..b6 as Black
is just fine playing it! We now see in the last decade or so what modern theory
tells us about 1.e4 b6 and 1.d4 b6 !} 2. e4 Bb7 3. Nc3 e6 4. d4 Bb4 { I have
played this positions *hundreds* of times!.... in bullet and 3+0 internet
blitz! That is why most of the reference games here are from blitz or internet
games!} 5. Bd3 Nf6 (5... d5 6. e5 {is a horrible French with an already 'dead'
French bishop on b7.}) 6. Qe2 (6. e5 $6 Ne4 7. Bd2 Nxd2 8. Qxd2 Bxf3 9. gxf3
Qh4 {looks actually very promising for Black!}) 6... d5 7. exd5 { This is the
best according to ChessBase 14 online reference.} (7. e5 Ne4 8. O-O {Not the
soundest pawn sacrifice. Nakamura got himself into some trouble against the
flamboyant master of blindfold Timur Gareev!} (8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. bxc3 c5 10. dxc5
Nxc5 11. h4 Nbd7 12. Rh3 Qc7 13. Kf1 Ne4 14. Re1 {and Black is actually better!
Donchekno however lost this game! So it seems that our 1...b6 is pretty
justifiable at least to the extend we covered!} Nxe5 15. Nxe5 Qxe5 16. Bb5+ Kf8

21. Bd2 Qa3 22. Bc1 Qc3 23. Bd2 Qa3 24. Bc1 {1/2-1/2 (24) Nakamura, H
(2798)-Gareev,T (2604) Saint Louis 2015}) 7... Qxd5 $1 {I guess Carlsen had
some deep preparation here! This moves follows with a series of forced moves
and definitely Carlsen had thoroughly reviewed them before!} (7... Nxd5 8. Bd2
Nxc3 9. bxc3 Be7 10. O-O {with a lot of initiative for White. This would not
have made Carlsen happy at all!}) 8. O-O Bxc3 9. bxc3 Nbd7 $1 {My engine says
the most accurate again!} 10. c4 Qh5 11. Bf4 Rc8 (11... c5 {1/2-1/2 (11)
Vukovic,Z (2410)-Velimirovic,D (2530) Niksic 1994} 12. d5 {and White is
slightly better.}) 12. a4 (12. Ne5 $1 {seems like the right move to me in terms
of tournament plans. With a healthy +4 score at this point, playing with a
little less ambition against Carlsen could not be a bad idea, especially when
you are caught in the opening. Don't you think? Additionally, Ne5 does not mean
that you are making a draw right away. White still has a pair of bishops and a
little bit more space, which offers him tangible chances to outplay his
opponent.} Nxe5 13. Bxe5 Qg5 $2 (13... Qxe2 14. Bxe2 Nd7 15. Bg3 $14) 14. f4)
12... a5 13. Rab1 $6 (13. Ne5 {I still prefer this move!}) 13... O-O 14. Rb5 c5
15. dxc5 {Eljanov counts too much on his dark-squared bishop and he voluntarily
shatters his pawn structure. Carlsen's provocative strategy is paying off.}
Rxc5 16. Bd6 Rxb5 17. cxb5 $2 (17. axb5 {makes a lot more sense. It is
extremeley important to restrict Black's piece activity. Now, Black will soon
land a monsterous knight on d5.}) 17... Rc8 18. c4 Nc5 {a4 is a target now.
White controlled d5 but there are too many good squares that Black can use.}
19. Bc2 Nce4 20. Bf4 $2 { [#] White should have put his bishop on g3 and avoid
exposing himself to the coming nasty tactics. After this tactical mistake White
is doomed.} Nc3 $1 { And Carlsen does not miss it.} 21. Qd3 Qg4 $6 {This was
not the point!} (21... Bxf3 $1 22. gxf3 {[#]} (22. Qxf3 Qxf3 23. gxf3 Ne2+)

23. Nd2 Ng4 24. g3 Qe5 $1 25. Qxe5 Nxe5 26. Rd1 g5 27. Bb3 {looks terrible but
was Eljanov's last chance. At least the queen's are off the board and he is not
down on material!}) 22... Qxc4 23. Qxc4 Rxc4 24. Bd3 Rc8 {The rest is a piece
of cake no matter if it is a Carlsen in shape or a Carlsen out of shape!} 25.
Ra1 Nfd5 26. Nd2 f6 27. Bd6 Nb4 28. Bc4 Bd5 29. Bf1 Nba2 $1 {Greedy and without
any mercy. Black's pieces are dominating the board and soon both the a and
b-pawns will fall. An important victory for Carlsen who is on his way to win
his first classical tournament of the year!} 0-1
