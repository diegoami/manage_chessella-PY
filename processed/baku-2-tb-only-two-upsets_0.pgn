Nd5+ {Aronian is down two pawns, but he has not lost hope. Black has to part with the a-pawn if he wants to win, which only leaves him one pawn on the board. Can White capture it?} Kc4 $1 {Black is winning the endgame. Knights are particularly bad at catching h-pawns, as this game proves.} 68. Nf4 h4 69. Kxa3 Kd4 70. Kb2 Ke4 71. Nh3 Kf3 72. Kc3 Ne4+ 73.
