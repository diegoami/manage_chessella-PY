decline,} Nc6 (7... dxe4 8. dxe4 Qxd1 9. Rxd1 Nxe4 10. Ne5 Nf6 11. c4 $44 { Big
time Catalan pressure, don't you think?}) 8. e5 Nd7 9. h4 {Now we can see the
point of White's play. He plans to continue with c2-c4 and Nb1-c3 putting real
pressure on the d5-pawn. Black may have the answer in} f6 $5 {but then} 10.
exf6 Bxf6 11. Nc3 $13) 7. d4 {Here we go. Just as in the Kramnik-Ghaem Maghami
game Vladimir shows no inhibitions about moving his d-pawn twice. Here it has a
clear point of stopping e6-e5 to leave Black with an awkward Chigorin setup
without his light-squared bishop out on g4.} b6 {So, it's going to be another
Queen's Indian Defense, an opening Kramnik has always had success against.} 8.

this position the way Kramnik did?} 17. Bh3 $1 {Setting up d4-d5 and eyeing the
