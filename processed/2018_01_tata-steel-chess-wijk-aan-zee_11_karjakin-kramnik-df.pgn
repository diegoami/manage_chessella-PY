of the hardest for me to understand. Whichever side of it I play, I always end
up slightly worse...} c5 (6... d4 {The last comment is even more true when
applied to this variation. I will provide two practical examples, not from the
highest level but nevertheless capable of showing my point.} 7. e3 (7. Bb2 c5

$132 {was my own practical experience with this system as Black: Oates,
D-Fernandez,D High Wycombe 2014. Here White's play seems quite easy, because
Black's only constructive plan might be ...a5-a4 but then of course White can
play with Na3.}) 7... c5 8. exd4 cxd4 9. d3 Nc6 10. Re1 Ne8 11. Ne5 Nxe5 12.

White-a good friend of mine- had unfortunately slightly lost touch with the
idea of the line in a game with a fellow Fernandez: Horton,A -Fernandez,F
Sitges 2016.}) 7. cxd5 ({Following the equally natural} 7. Bb2 Nc6 8. e3 b6 9.

half-open d-file in Caruana,F-Aronian,L Saint Louis 2017}) 7... Nxd5 8. Nc3 Nc6

afraid of} 15. Bh3 $1 {but he can re-route and use the long diagonal himself:}

d-file.} f5 18. Qd2 Nf7 19. Qd7 Bf6 20. Ne5 $1 $14 Nxe5 (20... Bxe5 $5 {
leads to a nice tactical variation.} 21. Bxb7 Qxd7 22. Rxd7 Rd8 23. Rxf7 $1 (
23. Rxd8+ Nxd8 24. Bxe5 Nxb7 25. Bb8 a6 $11 {should eventually get neutralised

best move.} 25. Rxa7 (25. c4 Rc8 {works as in the next line, since f4 can be
met by ...Bd4+!}) 25... Bxc3 26. Rb7 Ba5 {White is slightly better and will
probably pick up the e6-pawn but it is nothing to write home about.}) (24...

of the bishop ending.}) 25. Bb5 Kf8 26. f4 Bf6 27. Rd6 Re7 28. h5 $1 {Creating
various mating ideas.} Bxc3 29. Rxb6 {Now Black will not only lose the pawn

also hopeless.} Bb2 44. Bb5 Rc7 45. Rxc7 Kxc7 46. bxa4 Bc3 (46... Bxa3 47. a5

slowly over to the queenside with his king if need be.}) 47. e5 Kd8 48. Kf3 Bd2

opponent demonstrate. The White king needs the d5-square.} exf5+ 51. Kxf5 Bc1 (

one.} 1-0
