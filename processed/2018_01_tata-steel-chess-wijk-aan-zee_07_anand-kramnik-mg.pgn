1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. a4 d6 6. c3 a6 7. Bg5 {Virtually
every sensible move had been tried in such positions, and this one is also far
from being new. White's plan provokes Black's activity on the kingside and I
can't say that I like it.} ({Instead,} 7. O-O {transposes to a position from
the Round 5 game Carlsen-Kramnik.}) 7... h6 8. Bh4 Ba7 9. Nbd2 Qe7 $5 ({A
similar idea,} 9... g5 10. Bg3 Qe7 $5 11. O-O {and now} Nd7 $5 (11... h5 12. h4
$1) 12. d4 $6 h5 13. h4 g4 14. Ne1 exd4 {brought Black an advantage in the
game Demchenko-Ragger, Spanish ChT Linares 2017.}) 10. h3 {In the preceding
games White had played differently.} ({For example,} 10. Qe2 $5 {,
Najer-Aleksandrov, Tbilisi World Cup 2017.}) 10... g5 $1 11. Bg3 Nh5 12. Qe2
Qf6 $5 13. Bh2 Nf4 14. Bxf4 gxf4 15. g4 ({Engines' proposal} 15. O-O {is
really scary for White, with fair chances for him to be mated on the kingside
sooner or later,}) 15... Ne7 $5 ({A remarkable decision. Kramnik does not wish
to open lines on the kingside by} 15... fxg3 $5 16. fxg3 {(despite Black
objectively is doing quite well in this variation) and makes a more ambitious
move, keeping the position closed and more strategic. An approach, which
worked perfectly!}) 16. b4 {Later Anand could have regretted about this move.}
Ng6 $5 17. Kd1 $6 ({"He should've probably tried} 17. O-O-O $5 {and try to
meet ...h5 not with g5, but with gxh5" - Kramnik.}) 17... h5 $1 18. g5 ({Here,
after} 18. gxh5 Rxh5 {White loses the h-pawn.}) 18... Qe7 {In the long run,
it's White and not Black who'll get problems with a king, so perhaps Black can
be significantly better already here. Anand's further play may look almost
suicidal, but it's understandable that it wasn't easy at all to find a good
plan for him.} 19. b5 Kf8 20. bxa6 bxa6 21. d4 Kg7 {"My king is safe and I
started to mate him slowly on the queenside, and he has no good place for his
king. ...In a practical game it was very difficult [for White] to defend this
position" - Kramnik} 22. d5 Bd7 23. Kc2 Rhb8 24. Bxa6 $6 ({It may seem now
that what White did on the previous moves was opening lines and diagonals on
the queenside not for himself, but rather for his opponent. Still, after the
pawn sacrifice} 24. Ne1 $1 {and if} Qxg5 25. Nd3 {the play would have remained
quite tense.}) 24... Bxf2 $1 25. Bb5 Be3 26. h4 ({Maybe} 26. Nc4 {was a better
practical chance here.}) 26... Ra5 $5 27. c4 Rba8 28. Kb3 Nf8 $1 $19 29. Rhc1
Bg4 30. Kc2 Bxd2 31. Kxd2 Nd7 {And Black dominates completely.} 32. Ra3 Nc5 33.
Bc6 Rb8 34. Ke1 Qd8 35. Qc2 Bxf3 36. Rxf3 Qc8 $1 0-1
