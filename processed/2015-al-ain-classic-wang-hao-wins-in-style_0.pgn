Re1 Nh6 9. h3 Nf5 10. d3 Nd4 11. Bf4 O-O 12. Ne4 {Black has got the two Bishops
but his pawn structure is spoiled. White's e5-pawn gives him some space
advantage and tries to disturb the co-ordination between the Black forces. But
still the black bishops have their eyes open and so the position can be deemed
as unclear/equal.} b6 13. a4 a5 14. Nfd2 $146 {White has previously played
14.Ned2 or 14.b3 in this position.} Ra7 15. Nc4 {Visually the Knights seem to
be on good posts but they can be pushed away from there soon. White's intention
therefore was rather the provocation of ...b5 in order to find accessible
targets on the Queenside.} Bf5 ({The immediate} 15... b5 { would be answered
by} 16. Ncd2 {and then White has got his target on c5. For example} Ne6 (16...

potential target on c5 and so he now begins his counterplay with energetic
moves.} b5 $1 18. Ncd2 c4 19. dxc4 Rd7 20. Qe2 Bh6 ({Another energetic move
possible is} 20... Nd4 $5) 21. Nf3 Nd4 22. Nxd4 Rxd4 23. Ng3 Rd2 24. Qf3 Bxc2
25. axb5 cxb5 26. cxb5 Rd3 ({The alternative,} 26... Rd5 $5 { also seems good,
as there is no good way for White to support the b5-pawn.}) 27. Qc6 Bb3 28. Ne4
Bd5 29. Qc2 Bxe4 30. Rxe4 Qd5 {Black takes the b5-pawn and holds comfortably. A
fantastic tournament for Wang Hao, who won by a big margin.} 1/2-1/2
