kind of positions but with some differences. One can say that like in the game
Levon would not have been able to get in d4-d5!}) 4... c6 {[%emt 0:00:58]} 5.

the most active way for Black to play in this position.} 6. Qc2 {[%emt 0:00:08]

Leads to a common position. But Vassily wanted to make use of the time he has
saved on developing his g8 knight by getting his queenside pieces out and
working.}) 8. Nc3 {[%emt 0:06:33]} Rc8 {[%emt 0:14:08]} 9. O-O {[%emt 0:03:10]}

order to play the move c5 and here it would make not make sense if you didn't
make that move. As Levon said after the game, it is sometimes difficult to admit what you did was not correct and change the plan.} c5 {[%emt 0:
42:39] Vassily made this move after 42 minutes.} (10... Ngf6 11. Ne5 $16 {
is already horror for Black.}) 11. d5 $1 {[%emt 0:00:15] Levon was instantly
ready with his reply. It just took him 15 seconds to make this move. After the
game when he was asked what he thought about the objective quality of the move,
he said, I think it is extremely strong and after this White has a clearly
better position.} exd5 {[%emt 0:00:03]} 12. Nh4 $1 {[%emt 0:03:13] Of course,
the logical folllow up.} Ndf6 $2 {[%emt 0:08:18] After this Black is huge
trouble. Look at his kingside pieces. When are they going to develop?} ({

complete the development somehow.} (13... Qb6 14. Nxd5 Bxd5 15. Bxd5 Nxd5 16.

horrible position and he resigned. One of the main problems is the c5 pawn for
which you have to give up your b7 bishop with Bxe4 but after taking the bishop
back, there is nothing positive about Black's entire position.} 1-0
