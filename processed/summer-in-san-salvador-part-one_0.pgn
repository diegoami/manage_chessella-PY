{The tournament winner had the occasion to find out that San Salvador was a
dangerous place, indeed, from the very first round. In the position above he
was about to play:} 23... Ba6 {but noticed in time the following fantastic
variation:} 24. Nf6+ Kh8 (24... gxf6 $2 25. Qh3 {offers White a winning attack}
) 25. Qe4 gxf6 {It may seem that White's attack has come to an end but...} 26.
Qxh7+ $3 Kxh7 27. Rh3+ Kg6 28. f5+ $1 {Preventing the king's escape to the
centre.} exf5 29. Rg3+ {with a perpetual check. I was deeply impressed by this
resource which Evgeny showed me during the bus ride back to the hotel. And I
must say I have a huge satisfaction when given the chance to say that engines
are hopeless...the Russian laughed in their face, as they were unable to find
this forced draw, until shown! :) So instead of 23...Ba6 he played 23...Bb7,
controlling the e4-square and won a good technical game and the tournament in
style!} 0-1
