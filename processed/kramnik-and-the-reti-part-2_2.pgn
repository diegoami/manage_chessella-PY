1. Nf3 e6 2. g3 b5 3. e3 $5 {Usually White avoids this move in the Catalan, but
here the bishop hits the exposed pawn to gain a tempo.} a6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O
Nf6 6. b3 c5 7. c4 {It's some sort of an English now.} Be7 (7... bxc4 8. bxc4
Be7 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Rb1 {makes it look like the black bishop stepped out too
soon, while the counterpart on c1 is wisely taking its time.}) 8. Nc3 O-O $1 9.
d4 (9. cxb5 $2 axb5 10. Nxb5 Ba6) 9... d5 {Hari makes his choice towards a
classical approach of counterstrike in the center.} ({Benoni setup with a
passive Be7 is not to everyone's liking:} 9... Qb6 10. d5 exd5 11. cxd5 d6 12.
e4 Nbd7 13. h3 $14) 10. cxd5 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Bxd5 12. dxc5 {Kramnik relies on his
vast experience in symmetrical Queen's Gambit-type of positions.} Bxc5 { Maybe
a slight inaccuracy.} (12... Nd7 $142) 13. Qe2 Nd7 14. Rd1 Qe7 15. Bb2 Rac8 16.
Rac1 Bb7 $2 {An unforced error.} ({Kramnik showed no inclination toward e3-e4,
so the prophylactic} 16... h6 {was the most appropriate here.}) 17. Ng5 $1 {A
typical shot in many Queen's Indian positions, but here the white queen doesn't
attack h7, so what is this about?} Bxg2 18. Kxg2 {[#]} f5 { Not an easy
decision to make.} (18... Nf6 19. Bxf6 Qxf6 20. Nxh7 ({or even} 20. Qh5 Qg6 21.
Qxg6 hxg6 22. Rd7 $16) 20... Kxh7 21. Qh5+ {nets White a free pawn. }) ({The
point is to use the power of Bb2 to provoke a serious weakening of Black's
position.} 18... Nb6 19. Qg4 f5 20. Qh5 h6 21. Nf3 $14) ({Of all possible
variations} 18... Rfd8 19. Qh5 h6 20. Ne4 Ba7 {[#] is the most striking. White
wins on the spot with} 21. Rxd7 $3 Qxd7 22. Qg4 f5 23. Nf6+ { [#]} Kf7 (23...
Kh8 24. Qg6 Qb7+ 25. Kh3) 24. Qh5+ g6 25. Qxh6 Qb7+ 26. Kh3 Rh8 27. Nh7 $1) 19.
e4 $1 {The ghost of an attack against f2 doesn't scare Vladimir.} h6 20. Nf3
({Also} 20. Nh3 fxe4 21. Nf4 {looked pretty good for White.}) 20... Nf6 21.
exf5 exf5 22. Qxe7 Bxe7 23. Nd4 {[#]White's advantage has crystallized. His
bishop is much better placed, and Black has to worry about his exposed pawns on
both wings.} Rxc1 24. Rxc1 Nd5 25. Ne6 Rf7 26. Rc8+ Kh7 27. Ra8 $16 {Just like
that Kramnik won a pawn and forced resignation exactly 20 moves later.} f4 28.
