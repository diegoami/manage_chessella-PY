1. d4  Nf6  2. c4  g6  3. f3 {[%emt 0:00:10] When Anand was in a must win
situation against Gelfand in the World Championship 2012, he too played the f3
variation. There cannot be a better choice. White gets an attacking
double-edged position, just what the doctor ordered.} c5  4. d5  d6  5. Nc3  e6
 6. e4  Bg7  7. Nge2  O-O  8. Ng3 {[%emt 0:00:10] The game has transposed into
a Benoni/Saemisch King's Indian.} a6  9. a4  h5  10. Bg5  Qc7  11. Qd2  exd5 
12. cxd5  Nh7  13. Bh6  h4  14. Bxg7  Kxg7  15. Bc4 $5 { [%emt 0:00:01] A
perfect move for the occasion. White is in a must win scenario and doesn't have
much to lose.} hxg3  16. hxg3  Rh8 {[%emt 0:00:01] The only move. Objectively
this position should be fine for Black as Aronian pointed out in his interview
after the match, but in a rapid game it is a great weapon.} 17. e5 $5  ( 17.

onslught here.}) 21. d6  g5  22. Rhe1  b5  23. Bd5  Rb8  (23... Ra7 $5) 24. f4 
Qd4 $4 {[%emt 0:00:06] A huge oversight by Aronian.} (24... Qf5 {was the only
way to keep the game going, but White is just better after} 25. Nxg5 $16) 25.
Qe2 $1 {Attacks the queen and also threatens Qh5. Seeing this move MVL made one
more, but the position is already lost.} Qb4 26. Qh5 {The f7 point cannot be
defended and Maxime resigned. A great win for Levon.} 1-0
