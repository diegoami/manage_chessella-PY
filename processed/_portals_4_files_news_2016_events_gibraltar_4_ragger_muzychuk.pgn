pieces are harmoniously placed and the bishop on b7 makes a particularly good
impression. However, the position is easier to play for White who has a
straightforward plan: exchanging the white-squared bishops and advancing his
queenside majority.} 19. a3 Kf8 20. b4 h6 21. h3 Rxd4 22. Nxd4 a6 23. Nb3 Nd7

white-squared bishops White achieved his strategic goal and now enjoys an
advantage and the better game. Moreover, Black is in an uncomfortable position:
without real counterplay she has to guard against the advance of White's
queenside majority. Taking the pawn on c4 does not improve things. After} 26...
