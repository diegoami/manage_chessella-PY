1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 {Richard is always good for an unorthodox opening.
Meanwhile, in his Moscow apartment Alexander Morozevich breaks into a smile.}
3. Nf3 Bg4 4. Nc3 e6 5. cxd5 {This trade always brings Black some relief.} (5.
e3 $1 Nf6 6. Qa4 Bxf3 7. gxf3 Bb4 8. Bg2 {Korobov-Morozevich, 2015}) 5... exd5
6. Bg5 (6. Bf4 Bd6 {Lenic-Mopozevich, 2015.}) 6... Be7 7. Bxe7 Ngxe7 8. e3 O-O
9. Be2 Qd6 10. Rc1 Rae8 11. O-O {Sokolov's extra solid handling of the opening
brought about a question of how Rapport was going to handle the resulting
thematic pawn minority attack.} Nc8 $5 {Unusual openings call for unusual piece
placement.} 12. b4 $6 {Seeing that knight coming to b6, White is better off
holding back a bit.} (12. h3 Bh5 13. Na4 {is a standard plan of heading to c5,
many times used by Anatoly Karpov in similar QGD structures.}) 12... Nb6 ({
Naturally,} 12... Nxb4 {would be a short term gain with long term consequences
attached to it.} 13. Qb3 c6 14. a3 Na6 15. Qxb7 $16) 13. a3 Re6 14. h3 Bxf3 15.
Bxf3 Ne7 16. e4 $1 {Ivan Sokolov needs no further invitation to go forward. Is
White just going to wipe the opponent off the board?} c6 17. e5 Qd8 18. Be2 ({
In case of} 18. Na4 Nxa4 19. Qxa4 Qb6 {White is somewhat hampered by the
weakness on d4. Even winning the exchage after} 20. Rc5 Nf5 21. Bg4 Nxd4 22.
Bxe6 Nxe6 {doesn't guarantee anything.}) 18... Rh6 19. b5 $5 {Very principled,
yet risky. White takes a heavy obligation to keep everything under control.} f6
$1 20. f4 Nf5 21. Qd3 fxe5 22. dxe5 $2 {Well, Ivan couldn't do it.} ({The
extravagant position of Rh6 should have pointed Sokolov to the right direction
of trading pieces to leave that rook stranded,} 22. fxe5 {I guess, he didn't
like trading queens after} Qg5 23. Rce1 Qe3+ 24. Qxe3 Nxe3 25. Rxf8+ Kxf8 26.
Bd3 {but the endgame is not bad at all.} Nec4 27. bxc6 Rxc6 28. Ne2 {heading to
f4.}) 22... Nc4 $1 {Things are getting uncomfortably hot around that
e3-square.} 23. bxc6 bxc6 24. Nd1 Rg6 $1 {Resourcefullness in tactical
positions is a trademark of Richard's style.} 25. Bg4 Qb6+ 26. Rf2 Nfe3 27.
Nxe3 Nxe3 28. Rb1 Qc5 29. Bh5 (29. Bf3 $1 Rxf4 30. Rb8+ Kf7 31. Qb1 {would have
provided White with enough counterchances, but Ivan was unable to switch
gears.}) 29... Rg3 30. e6 $2 ({Surprisingly,} 30. Bf3 {was still the right
move, as with the pawn on e5} Nxg2 $2 {doesn't work on account of} 31. Bxd5+)
30... g6 31. Bf3 Nxg2 $1 {And just like that the entire house came crushing
down on the poor Sokolov. Facing mate or loss on time he gave up right here.}
0-1
