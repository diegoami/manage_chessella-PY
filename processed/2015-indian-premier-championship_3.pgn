1. e4 c5 {Sethuraman obviously has a wide repertoire & before the round I
expected a Modern but he surprised me with Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 e6 3. g3 {So over
the board I also decided to counter surprise him!} Nc6 4. Bg2 Nf6 5. Qe2 e5 $5
{An interesting move brought into lime light by Caruana!} 6. O-O Be7 7. c3 O-O
8. d3 Re8 9. Na3 Bf8 $6 (9... h6 $142 {Black must stop Bg5 before playing Bf8})
10. Bg5 $1 {After the exchange, White will have very strong control over the
light squares in the centre which makes d5 break difficult for Black. The
bishop on f8 also remains passive.} h6 11. Bxf6 Qxf6 12. Nc4 d6 13. Ne3 $14 { I
was pretty happy with my position. I normally play such structures with Black
and it was the first time playing with White, that too I had to handle against
2600!} Ne7 {with this move the queen cannot retreat and is misplaced} ( 13...
Be6 $5) 14. Nd2 {Threatening to play f4} g5 $6 {A huge positional mistake
though it was the idea behind Black's previous move. This shows clearly that
things went very bad for Black.} 15. Kh1 {I had a very good position that
simply I didn't know what to play, there were many options and I just wanted to
play a kind of waiting but useful move} (15. Bf3 $5 {I was also thinking to
play Bf3 but later decided to wait}) 15... Bg7 16. c4 $1 {With the idea Nb1-c3,
I wanted to exchange Black's knight and bring Good Knight vs Bad Bishop
scenario. If he doesn't exchange then I leave a disturbing knight on d5! } Bd7
17. Nb1 Nc6 (17... Qg6 {I was expecting him to play Qg6 to create some
counterplay with f5 or sometimes with h5} 18. Bf3 {for which I planned to reply
with Bf3 and White is better but still would have been a good choice for
Black}) (17... b5 {basing on his previous move, I thought maybe he was planning
to create some counterplay on the queenside but instead he played Nc6 quickly})
18. Nc3 Nd4 19. Qd1 Rad8 20. Ne2 $1 {I liked this move very much during the
game, just nutralizing his activity as he cannot exchange} Nc6 21. Rb1 $1
{Protecting b2 before f4, killing counterplay for my opponent} Qg6 22. f4 {My
pieces are well arranged and I felt the time has come} exf4 {We should always
be careful as after the break Black's bishops get in to the game especially the
dark square bishop which has no counterpart} 23. gxf4 Qh5 $2 { A very good idea
but has a sort of tactical refutation} ({After the game we thought Black should
play gxf4} 23... gxf4 24. Nxf4 {Still White is clearly better}) 24. Bf3 $1 {A
cute line and also a forcing one to keep the advantage for White. Without this
Black might be even slightly better.} Qh4 25. Ng2 $1 Qh3 26. Ng1 $1 (26. f5 $4
{with the idea to trap Black's queen fails to} Be5 $1 {and White can resign})
26... Qe6 27. f5 $16 {Black is stuck again} Qe7 28. Ne3 {Regrouping pieces
back} Nd4 $2 29. f6 $1 $18 {And now White has a decisive advantage, after the
game Sethuraman admitted to have missed it} Bxf6 30. Nd5 Qe5 31. Bh5 Bg7 (31...
Re6 32. Nf3 $1 Nxf3 33. Qxf3 Kg7 34. Rf2 $1 {Black is completely lost}) 32.
Bxf7+ Kh8 33. Bxe8 Qxe8 (33... Rxe8 34. Nf3 $18) 34. Nf6 $1 Bxf6 35. Rxf6
{White is clearly winning and I wanted to just make sure not to play a blunder
in time trouble} Bc6 {Black is still not without any threats as my pieces are
clearly misplaced, for ex} 36. Rf2 {I wanted to coordinate pieces} (36. Rxh6+
$4 Kg7 {White pieces are badly misplaced especially the b1 rook} 37. Rh3 Bxe4+
$1 38. dxe4 Qxe4+ 39. Nf3 Nxf3 {White cannot recapture with a queen} 40. Rxf3
(40. Qxf3 Qxb1+) 40... Rf8 $17) 36... Kg7 37. Qg4 Rd7 38. Rbf1 Re7 39. Nf3 Ne6
40. Nh4 {The rest is simple but still I had to workout some lines during the
game} Kh7 41. Nf5 h5 42. Qg3 h4 43. Qg4 Rd7 44. Ne3 Rg7 45. Rf6 Nf4 46. Nf5 Rg6
47. Rxf4 1-0
