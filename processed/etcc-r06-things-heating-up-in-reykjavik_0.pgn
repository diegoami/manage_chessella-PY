Bg5 $5 {Mariya Muzychuk shows her intentions right from the start. She is going for the kill with the Trompowsky.} e6 3. e4 h6 4. Bxf6 Qxf6 5. Nc3 Bb4 6. e5 (6. Qd2 {is the main line.}) 6... Qe7 7. Qd3 {All that the Ukrainian wanted was an original game. Now she has it. This position has only been played twice.} b6 8. O-O-O Bb7 9. f4 Bxc3 10. Qxc3 c5 11. dxc5 Qxc5 12. Qxc5 bxc5 {How can we assess this position? At first sight it looks favourable for White as she has more space and her rook is already on the semi open file putting pressure on d7. But on closer inspection you realize that the bishop on b7 is superbly placed and the king will be ideal on e7. All in all it's a well balanced position where the better player will win.} 13. Ne2 Ke7 (13... g5 $1 {would have given a great position to Kosteniuk.}) 14. Nc3 g5 15. f5 $1 { Fantastic play by Muzychuk. She is extremely alert and takes her chance.} exf5 (15... Nc6 16. f6+ Kd8 17. Re1 $14 {is very uncomfortable for Black. The pawn on f6 is a real thorn in the side.}) 16. Nd5+ Kd8 (16... Ke6 17. Bc4 $18) ( 16... Bxd5 17. Rxd5 Nc6 18. Rxc5 $16 {is clearly a favourable position for White with the bishop coming to d3.}) 17. Nf6 Kc8 18. h4 $1 {Black is thoroughly uncoordinated and Mariya takes full advantage of it, opening the position from all sides.} g4 19. Rd2 {Defending g2 so that the bishop on f1 can develop.} Nc6 20. Nxd7 (20. Rxd7 $1 Nxe5 21. Re7 Ng6 22. Rxf7 Nf4 23. Bc4 Bxg2 24. Re1 $18) 20... Rd8 21. Nxc5 Rxd2 22. Kxd2 Nxe5 {Somehow it seems to me that the move sequence starting with Nxd7 has given Black some counterplay although White is clearly in the driver's seat due to her active king.} 23. Ke3 Bc6 24. Kf4 {The king single handedly marches on and takes on the black army.} f6 25. Kxf5 Kc7 26. b4 Bd5 27. Rg1 Bxa2 28. Kxf6 {White is a pawn up and with such an active king well and truly on her way to victory.} Nc6 29. c3 Rf8+ 30. Kg7 Rg8+ 31. Kh7 (31. Kxh6 {was also possible.} Ne5 32. Bd3 $18) 31... Ne5 32. Bd3 Rd8 33. Bf5 Rd2 34. Re1 Nc6 35. Re8 h5 (35... Rxg2 36. Rc8+ Kd6 37. Be4 $18 ) 36. Kh6 Rd6+ 37. Kg5 Rd5 38. Kf4 Rd8 39. Rxd8 Nxd8 40. Bg6 Bd5 41. g3 Kb6 42. Bxh5 a5 43. Bxg4 Kb5 44. Be2+ Bc4 45. Bxc4+ Kxc4 46. h5 {A very fine victory for Mariya, who played like a World Champion!} 1-0
