Maroczy-type positions with White (i.e. not an Open Sicilian.) Black has a
slightly wider variety of options, but as White has not yet completely
committed his centre, the worst-cases outcomes for him are not as bad and the
position is thus marginally more peaceful.} Nf6 (4... Qb6 {makes more sense

White realised that the standard moves were not promising anything.} (6. e4 {

I realised soon in Fernandez,D-Sax,G Kecskemet 2013, where I managed to draw
with my illustrious opponent.}) 7... Nxd5 8. Nxd5 exd5 9. Qxd5 Bb4+ {This
position has been analysed to death, but the long and short of it is that
Black is fine.}) 6... d5 (6... Bc5 $5 {is more commonly played, and it's quite

play continues along Tarrasch lines.}) 8... d5 $1 {An interesting pawn
sacrifice. The details probably deserve a whole review in CBM, but let me just
say for now that} 9. cxd5 exd5 10. exd5 Ng4 $1 11. Be3 Nxe3 12. fxe3 Ne5 $44 {
gives Black at least enough for the pawn.}) 7. cxd5 exd5 {Black has maybe made
a slightly substandard decision in going into the Tarrasch structure without
White making any special concessions, but I would still hesitate to call this
an opening edge for White.} 8. e3 (8. g3 Bc5 9. Be3 {looks most critical, and
here there is a game from one of the greatest '...e6 Sicilian theoreticians'

essentially completed development. White's plans all include simply bolstering
the d4-square repeatedly, whereas Black has greater variety: he can play for a
kingside attack, or for ...b5-b4, or maybe even ...d4 in some cases.} Bb8 {
Making Black's intentions clear. He would like ...Qd6, ...Rfd8 if necessary, ..

indeed it cues up a possible Nd3-f4 jump for White.} (18... Ba7 {immediately
was marginally better.}) 19. Re1 Ba7 $5 {Black protects against Nc5, and
vaguely hints that one day he might like to play ...d4. Black doesn't have an
ideal move anymore; both this and my alternative leave White a little
something.} (19... Rfd8 20. Nc5 Qe7 {is the engine suggestion, but here White
can probably take advantage of the exposed bishop on h3:} 21. Nd3 $1 $14 {
whereupon the beast wants to head back to g4, proclaiming '0.17' but this is a
good sign that things have not proceeded ideally for Black.}) 20. Nc3 $6 (20.

{In this game White demonstrates an excellent understanding of the issues with
...Na6 in the King's Indian, and then retains a clear head when the execution
turns a little bit messy.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6.
Nf3 e5 7. O-O Na6 {This move is in third place behind ...Nc6 and ...Nbd7, but
it has had its periods of popularity and it's still not totally clear to me
that White has any advantage. Notably, the move is popular with Ukrainian
players- the ideological descendants of the old Lviv KID school, such as
Golubev.} 8. Be3 (8. Re1 $5 {is the second-most-played move, and it asks again
whether Black would like to play with the centre open or closed.} c6 9. Bf1 {
is main, and now Black should probably head for the Philidor-esque positions
after ...exd4, because he lacks other useful moves that preserve the central
tension.}) 8... Ng4 {This is Black's main move. Against most other things
White has a simpler choice of what to do with the centre, and against minor
moves White should simply consolidate (Qd2, Rac1, Rfe1, etc.)} (8... b6 $5 {
looks like a logical way to prepare ...exd4, intending to play ...Bb7, ...Nc5
and ...a5 in some order after that is done. Furthermore, the obvious move 9.d5
also makes ...b6 look useful. The problem is simply that Black's preparatory
moves are less useful than White's, because he is making them in less space.}
9. Re1 $1 (9. d5 Nc5 10. Nd2 a5 {Here I was able to find interesting ways to
make incidental use of the move 8...b6 in my research.} 11. b3 (11. a3 a4 12.

enter an inferior version of either the ...exd4 structures or the d5 ones.})

major way of playing, but this has not taken off among elite players.}) (8...

ill-advised improvisation rather than preparation.} (10... Nh6 {is again the
most flexible move- Black will probably want to play ...f5 in the future, but
it should be suitably prepared with ...Nf7 and maybe also ...c6. For instance,}

wrong because the squares left in Black's centre will be too weak after the
pawns are liquidated.} 13. Nxd4 c5 14. bxc5 dxc5 15. Ndb5 f5 16. Be3 (16. Qb3

probably have played this, but White has a few ways to claim an edge, of which
two of the simplest are:} 12. dxe5 (12. h3 e4 13. hxg4 exf3 14. Bxf3 fxg4 15.

great concessions while Black is busy trying to regain his pawn on f5.}) 14. h3

unpalatable} 18... Rac8 19. Nxa7 Rce8 $16 {rather than let both rooks be tied

and Nd5 come next, and even if White is not winning material by force, it is
clear that Black's construction on the kingside and in the centre is in an
advanced state of collapse.}) 20. Re3 Kh8 {Humanly, this might be the best
thing Black could do about the latent ideas of Rg3, but it is another small
inaccuracy.} 21. Nd5 $1 Ne6 $2 {A mistake in a difficult situation.} 22. Rxe6

The rest could have been spared.} Bg7 31. Bxg8 Nxg8 32. Qd5 Bf6 33. Ne8 Rb2 34.
Ra8 {An interesting middlegame example of domination- in the final position,
material is still completely level, but Black has been totally tied down. The
most obvious threat is Nxf6, but also Nxd6 would be immediately decisive.} 1-0
