1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Nbd2 {Home-made chess it is today! It is a relief to
see one of the world elite players trying out an 'interesting' 3rd move in
this position- there are many which have appealed to me and other theory-lite
players in the past, including Bg5, c3, b4...} ({It would be remiss of me not
to mention the 'Old Speckled Egg' setup, pioneered by my fellow English GM,
Keith Arkell. The idea is similar to those of the text.} 3. b4 Bg7 4. Bb2 O-O
5. Nbd2 d6 $1 {Against ...d5 setups, White obtains an easier position!} 6. e3
c5 $11 {Black had equalised and ultimately won in Fernandez,D-Ghasi,A chess.
com INT 2017}) 3... d5 4. e3 (4. b4 $5 {is interesting if we bear the above
note in mind. For instance, now} Bg7 5. Bb2 O-O 6. e3 Bf5 7. c4 a5 8. b5 {
leaves Black a bit short of plans, so Black might have to play more directly,
for instance with 4...a5.}) 4... Nc6 {Among other things, this move prevents
b4, but it is hard to find plans for Black in what follows.} 5. b3 Bg7 6. Bb2
O-O 7. Be2 a5 8. a3 (8. c4 {attempts to call Black's bluff:} a4 {is not that
threatening since after} 9. bxa4 {the pawn will prove rather hard to regain.})
8... b6 (8... Ne4 9. c4 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 $14) 9. O-O e6 10. c4 Ne7 11. cxd5 {
Allowing Black's light-squared bishop to develop on its preferred diagonal.} ({
We have nevertheless reached a vaguely Catalan-esque position, in which White
tends to keep the central pawn tension until an advantageous moment, so} 11.
Qc2 $5 {deserved consideration. There could follow:} c6 12. Rac1 Ba6 13. Rfd1
Rc8 14. Qb1 $14 {and White has a good version of the Catalan, because ...c5 is
almost impossible to arrange.}) 11... exd5 12. b4 c6 13. Rc1 {A slightly
strange move, conceding the a-file and hence equality.} (13. b5 {was the most
principled. Doubtless, Black has in mind the equally principled} cxb5 14. Bxb5
Bd7 {but here White can pretend to have an edge, e.g.} 15. Bxd7 Qxd7 16. a4 $32
{when if nothing else, the queenside pawn structure bodes well for an endgame.}
) 13... axb4 14. axb4 b5 {Black keeps it solid, since ...Ne8-d6-c4 is not too
hard to arrange for him.} 15. Nb3 (15. Ne5 Qd6 16. Qc2 $5 {was an interesting
and quite maximalist pawn sacrifice.}) 15... Ra2 16. Bc3 Ne4 17. Be1 (17. Nfd2
Nxc3 18. Rxc3 Qd6 $11 {still leads to an equal position- White has two knights
but only one useful outpost!}) 17... Ra6 {From a human point of view, it is
sensible to cut out Na5 options with the attendant rook-traps, and also
protect the c6-pawn.} (17... Bg4 $5 18. h3 Bxf3 19. Bxf3 Nd6 $11 {is equal for
precisely the same reason as the last note}) 18. Nc5 Rb6 $6 {Solid to a fault.}
(18... Nxc5 19. Rxc5 Qd6 {might have been slightly more unpleasant for White
to play- c6 is not easy to hit, and Black's doubling on the a-file comes
quickly.}) 19. Ra1 Bg4 20. h3 Bxf3 21. Bxf3 Nxc5 22. bxc5 Rb8 {Now if we are
looking at the position seriously, White has a slight edge, though quite how
to prosecute it is not clear.} 23. Ra7 (23. Qc2 Ra8 24. Bb4 Qd7 25. Ra2 Ra7 26.
Rfa1 Rfa8 27. Be2 $14 {followed by kingside pawn pushes might be the best way
to try- Black has no counterplay and while his position is tremendously solid,
he has no option other than staying solid.}) 23... Ra8 24. Qa1 Qb8 (24... Rxa7
$5 25. Qxa7 Nf5 26. Bb4 Qg5 $132) 25. Rxa8 Qxa8 26. Bb4 Qb7 27. Qc3 Ra8 28. Ra1
h5 29. g4 {Now play looks similar to two notes ago, but Black is closer to
arranging the major-piece swaps in a good way.} hxg4 30. hxg4 f5 31. Rxa8+ Qxa8
32. Qa3 Qc8 {On principle, with White having played kingside pawn pushes, it
is correct to keep queens on.} (32... Qxa3 $5 33. Bxa3 f4 $11 {was a way for
Black to think about maybe, eventually, winning-on a good day with a following
wind, and if and only if White tries to win with a pawn break.}) 33. gxf5 Qxf5
34. Kg2 g5 {The position is now completely balanced and it is for White to
force a draw before Black develops real play with ...Ng6 or ...g4.} 35. Be2
Qe4+ (35... Ng6 36. Qd3 $1 $11) 36. Bf3 Qf5 37. Be2 Qe4+ 38. Bf3 1/2-1/2
