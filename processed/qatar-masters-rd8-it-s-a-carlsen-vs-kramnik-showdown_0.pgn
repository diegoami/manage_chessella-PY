dxc4 9. Bxc4 c5 10. O-O cxd4 11. Ne4 Qe7 12. exd4 {This is much more combative
than taking on d4 with the knight. The isolated pawn means that there is an
imbalance and an imbalance means that both sides have to play actively to make
use of their imbalances.} (12. a3 {is the new move with which Dubov beat Anand
in the World Rapid.}) 12... Rd8 13. Qe2 Nc6 14. Rfd1 Ba5 15. Ng3 Bb6 16. Qe4
Bd7 17. h4 $5 {Typical Mamedyarov. Until here everything was seen in the game
Shimanov-Matlakov 2014. But this is a new move.} Be8 18. a3 Rd6 19. Qg4 $6 ({
It was a good time to think about equalizing and get rid of the isolated pawn.
} 19. d5 exd5 (19... Rad8 20. Qc2 $1 Rxd5 (20... exd5 21. Nf5 $16) 21. Bxd5
exd5 $14) 20. Rxd5 Qxe4 21. Nxe4 Rxd5 22. Bxd5 Rd8 23. Nc3 $11) 19... Rad8 {
Now the d4 pawn is just a weakness.} 20. d5 Qf8 $1 {You are not going to be
able to fool Magnus. He takes out his queen from the Nf5 fork tricks and gets
ready to take on d5.} 21. Qe4 Ne7 {Thanks to the pin on the d-file the pawn
cannot really move.} 22. Bd3 f5 $1 23. Qe5 Nxd5 24. Bxf5 $2 exf5 25. Nxf5 { Did
Mamedyarov stir up some complications once again?} Rc6 $1 {Not really! The rook
on c1 would hang if the d-rook moved and if Rxc6 then bxc6 would solidify the
knight on d5.} 0-1
