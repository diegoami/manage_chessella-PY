With only seven rounds to qualify for "Monday Millionaire" players who have the ambition and strength for the coveted spot must play every single game for a win. As a result, physical stamina and good opening preparation before the tournament in which everything could be decided in as few as three days! In this game, GM Ashwin Jayaram had the indepth preparation but somehow did not manage to maintain equality in the endgame against his opponent: Olympiad gold-medal winner GM Sam Shankland.} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Ba5 {This move was out of fashion a decade ago due to some crushing victories by GM Volokitin. Although it is back to open tournaments, it is still far from fully justified. Ashwin has other things in mind.} 6. b4 cxd4 7. Qg4 {This move was first introduced by none other than the master of fearless attacks.....No, not Tal, but Rashid Nezhmetdinov!} Kf8 8. Nb5 Bb6 (8... Bc7 9. Qxd4 Nc6 10. Qc5+ Nge7 11. Nxc7 Qxc7 12. Nf3 a6 13. Bd3 Bd7 14. Bb2 Rc8 15. O-O {0-1 (104) Asgarizadeh,A (2424)-Mirzoev,A (2556) Urmia 2015 is another highly dubious alternative.}) 9. Nf3 Ne7 10. Bd3 Nbc6 11. Bb2 Ng6 12. Qg3 f6 {GM Jayaram challenges White's center immediately. One of the typical ideas in the French Defence.} (12... a6 13. Nbxd4 Nxd4 14. Nxd4 Qh4 15. Nb3 Bd7 16.

I am sure that Ashwin had this position deeply analyzed before.} 15. Nxe5 fxe5 16. Qxe5 {[#]} Rh5 $1 {And now this move! Isn't Black's king in danger?} 17. Nxe6+ Bxe6 18. Qxe6 (18. Qxg7+ $2 Ke8 19. O-O-O Qc7 20. Qxg6+ Qf7 21. Qd3 Rc8 {and Black should be better thanks to his extra piece.}) 18... Qe8 {This solves all of the problems Black has. Ashwin Jayaram achieved full equality out of this less common opening.} 19. Qxe8+ Rxe8+ 20. Kd1 Rg5 21. g3 Bxf2 22. Bc1 (22. Rf1 Rf5) 22... Rf5 23. Rb1 (23. Bf4 Bd4 24. Rb1 g5 25. Bd2 g4 {and it is only Black who can play for a win.}) 23... Re4 24. Rb3 Kf7 25. Bf4 Ke6 26. h4 {The position is even. Black's active play compensates for his poor pawn structure.} Bd4 27. Re1 Be5 28. Bxe5 Kxe5 29. Rc3 Rf7 30. Rxe4+ Kxe4 $6 { an attempt to win?!} (30... dxe4 31. Ke2 Kd4 32. Rc8 Rf3 33. Rd8+ Kc4 34. Rd7 Rxg3 35. Rxg7 Rxa3 36. Rxb7 Rh3 37. Rxa7 Kxb4 {is one way to reach a primitve draw.}) 31. Ke2 Kd4 32. Rc8 {White will start to push Black's king back.} Ke5 33. Ke3 Kf5 $2 {This is too much. Black decentralizes his king} (33... d4+ 34.

Rc3 {Black probably missed this move.} Rf3 36. Rc7 $1 {White owns all the pawns on the seventh rank now.} Rxg3 37. Rxb7 Rxa3 38. Rxg7 Kh5 39. Kxd5 {The game is over now. Shankland has no problem in converting his advantage into a full point.} a5 40. Rh7+ Kg4 41. b5 Rc3 42. Rh6 Kf5 43. h5 Rxc2 44. Rxg6 Rb2 45. Kc4 Rc2+ 46. Kb3 Rh2 47. Rc6 Ke4 48. b6 Rxh5 49.

His perfect opening preparation did not yield what he should have easily achieved with a few 'healthy' moves.} 1-0
