Risky. Black neglects his development to grab the b2-pawn.} 8. Nd2 Qxb2 9. Ne4 Qb6 10. Qg4 Na5 11. Be2 Qb2 12. O-O Qxc2 {
Black is not afraid and takes a second pawn. But though White

Qa4 14. Rab1 a6 15. Rfd1 h6 16. Bg3 Nc6 17. Qf4 b5 18. Bh5 {White has taken time to improve his pieces, but now he has
concrete threats, which Black can hardly parry.} Nd8 19. Bh4 $1

Qf3+ Kc7 26. Qxa8 {the simplest: white is an exchange up with a
persistent attack.}) 24. Bxc6 Ra7 25. Rxd7 Qxa2 26. Rb7+ Rxb7 27. Qxb7+ {
and black gave up. 27...Ka5 28.Rxb5+ axb5 29.Qxb5# would have been the conclusion.} 1-0
