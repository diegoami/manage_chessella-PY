a pleasant position, but Sasikiran's last move, Re6, turned out to be an error
which was taken advantage of by Vitiugov in superb fashion.} 27. Rxd4 $1 Nxd4
28. Qxd4+ {If the king moves to g8 the Nf6 will win back the material, and
hence Sasikiran played f6, asking Vitiugov to show his cards.} f6 {[#]} 29. Nc7
$3 {A brilliant move. Now Qxd4 loses to Nxe6+} Re7 30. Ne8+ $1 {What an
aesthetic little check! The e8 square is guarded by all the three major pieces!
If you go to h7 or g8 then f6 is taken by the knight with check and if you go
to f7 or f8 or h8 then Qxf6 comes with check.} (30. Ne6+ {was also similar.})
30... Qxe8 31. Qxd8 Qf7 {Black has a weak king and a pawn less. Quite easy for
a player of Vitiugov's standard to convert this position.} 32. Rd6 g5 33. b3
