 Bxd7  14. fxe4  dxc4  15. Qxc4  b5  16. Qd3 {468 It is quite clear that White
is enjoying a considerable advantage, and one might expect a clean victory over
his opponent rated 399 Elo less, but as will be seen, no one is going down
easy.} c5  17. Bf4  c4 $1 {608 This bold move shows that Black is ready to
fight back, keeping his own options alive.} (17... cxd4 $6 {would have been a
more timid approach, offering Black fewer chances for a result to his liking.}

is a completely logical continuation, weakening not only the kingside but
opening up the dark squares for future invasions.} a4  22. h6  g6  23. Be5  b3 
24. a3 {610 [#]} Bxa3 $3 {301 Though not impossible to see, the second
exclamation point is also for the courage to go through with it against the
top-seed right in the first round.} 25. bxa3  b2 {4 An exchange will go down,
no matter what, and the only question is how. The real issue is the resulting
position. Black may recover material, but his counter play may suffer as a
result.} 26. Rc3  (26. Rb1 $2 {would be very poor after} c3) 26... b1=Q  27.

complex position, after 31 moves of blow and counter blow, the Elo difference
has only been on the scoresheet, and not the board.} Qb2  32. g4  Be8 $6 { 33
Short of time, Black finally starts to go astray, perhaps feeling unnecessarily
optimistic or ambitious, and the volatile nature of the position blows up in
his face.} 33. g5 {162 It should be noted that the computers clearly state this
position is equal, but if you ask a grandmaster, most (at least the three here)
will favor White almost overwhelmingly. As is the nature of engines and their
ability to calculate, each attempt by White has a viable defense, which is
sufficient. Naturally, finding them is another story.} Rb7 $4 {52 From misstep
to slip and stumble, the game is now in White's hands, and Rafael Leitao, known
for his precise calculation, has no trouble finding it.} 34. Bg4  Bd7  35. Qf2
