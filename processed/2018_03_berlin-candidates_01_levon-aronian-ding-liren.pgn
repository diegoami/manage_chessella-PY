1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 d5 4. e5 d4 5. exf6 dxc3 6. bxc3 Qxf6 7. d4 b6 8. h4
{[#] That certainly looks like a fighting Aronian.} (8. Nf3 {is most often played at this point.}) 8... Bb7 9.
Bg5 Qf5 10. Bd3 Qa5 11. Kf1 Nc6 (11... Qxc3 12. Ne2 Qb4 13. c5 {would be playable
but Black would have given White a lead in developmental
and a difficult defensive task, which was certainly not in Ding's interest.}) 12. Rb1 f6 (12... Qxa2 13. Ra1 Qb2 14. Ra4 $16) 13. Bd2 O-O-O
(13... Qa3 {would have been the best move - avoiding the constraining a2-a4 giving space to the black queen.}) 14. a4 $1 {[#] Now White is a little better: without
material loss, White has gained some space advantage and Black's queen is unable to move.} e5 15. c5 (15. Rh3 {the computers
suggests at this point. The fact that after this move the d3-bishop has been covered, the threat of c4-c5 probably increased.}) 15... Bxc5 16. Rb5 Qa6 17.
Rh3 {[#]} Bxd4 $1 18. Be2 (18. cxd4 Rxd4 19. Ne2 Qxa4 20. Qb1 Rdd8 21. Nc3 Qd4
$11) 18... Rd6 (18... Ba8 $1 $11 {allowing the queen to come back into the game via b7.}) 19. Rb1 (19. Rb2 $1 Qa5 20. cxd4 Qd5 21. dxe5 {White still has
an edge. The difference between Rb1 and Rb2 is that on b2 the rook defends the d2-bishop.}) 19... Qa5 20. Rb5 Qa6 21. Rb1 Qa5 22. Rb5 1/2-1/2
