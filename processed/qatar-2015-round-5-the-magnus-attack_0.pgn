{If there was a competition for the most entertaining game of the Qatar Masters
2015 until round five, it has to be this duel between the World Champion and Li
Chao. Let us dive in to this beautiful game.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. f3 d5 4.
cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O f5 10. e5 Nb4 11.
Nh3 {In this position Be6 is the main move, but Li Chao played a novelty with
Qe8. However it doesn't really alter the nature of the position and hence the
impact of the new move is not so great.} Qe8 (11... Be6 12. Kb1 Qd7 13. Nf4 {is
how play usually proceeds.}) 12. Kb1 {With this move starts some sort of a
tempo war. White would like to play Nf4 but only when Black goes Be6. Hence
both sides keep making improving moves and not committing to Nf4/Be6.} (12. Nf4
Qf7 13. Kb1 g5 $5) 12... a5 13. Be2 c6 {In the post game interview Magnus said
that c6 was a good move but he was happy to see it because now the queen on e8
cannot really go to a4 and there will be no mate!} 14. Rc1 Kh8 15. Ka1 {All the
useful moves have been made and Black has to play Be6 finally.} (15. a3 {is
possible but Magnus didn't really want to create a target on the queenside.})
15... Be6 16. Nf4 Qf7 {[#]} 17. h4 $1 {Once you see how interesting this move
is you really go for it, although the consequences are not at all easy to
calculate.} (17. Nxe6 Qxe6 18. h4 Rfd8 19. h5 g5 $11 { With Bxe5 coming up
Black should be alright here.}) 17... Bxa2 (17... Rfd8 { could have been a much
more safe way for Li Chao to play.} 18. h5 g5 $1 19. Nxe6 Qxe6 20. f4 (20. Bxg5
$2 Bxe5 $17) 20... gxf4 21. Bxf4 c5 $132) 18. h5 $1 Kg8 (18... g5 19. Ng6+ $1
{Of course this is the point. If the rook was not on f8 this was not possible
and hence Rfd8 instead of Bxa2 could have been better. }) 19. hxg6 hxg6 20. g4
$1 {As Magnus rightly said, "It clearly feels that White should be the one
coming first." Although for a normal player a4-a3 looks just as threatening.}
Bb3 {Black now has the deadly threat of a4-a3. How do you deal with it?} (20...
a4 21. gxf5 a3 22. b3 $1 {Closing things down.} Qxb3 23. Nxg6 $18) 21. Bd1 $1
{A great move that was missed by Li Chao. Well, truth be told it has only one
purpose: to clear the second rank for the white queen to go to h2 and mate the
black king. So Bf1 would also have worked but on d1 the bishop stays in the
thick of things.} a4 22. Qh2 Rfd8 23. Qh7+ Kf8 24. d5 $1 {The idea of this move
is to sever the connection of the queen on f7 and the bishop on b3, and also to
open an attack on the knight on b6. But the main thing is the interference. So
now if a3 then the bishop on b3 is hanging. Also the move e5-e6 becomes a
killer move.} (24. Nxg6+ Ke8 {is not at all clear because how do you continue
your attack? And at the same time a3 looks pretty strong.}) (24. e6 $2 Bxe6
$19) 24... Nc4 {A very interesting move by Li Chao. He is ready to even give up
his queen if he can get in the move a3.} ( 24... a3 25. Bxb3 $1 {That was the
point of 24.d5: to cut the communication between the bishop on b3 and the queen
on f7.}) (24... N6xd5 25. e6 $1 Qf6 26. Nxg6+ Ke8 27. Qg8+ Bf8 28. Rh8 $18)
(24... Bxd5 25. Bxb6 $18) (24... Bxd1 25. Ne6+ (25. e6 $6 a3 $1 26. exf7 axb2+
27. Kxb2 Nc4+ 28. Kb1 Na3+ 29. Kb2 Nc4+ $11) 25... Ke8 26. Nxg7+ Kf8 27. Qh8+
$18) 25. Nxg6+ $1 Ke8 26. e6 $1 a3 27. exf7+ {A queen falling with check must
be taken. Later other things can be thought about!} Kd7 28. Ne5+ $1 (28. f8=N+
$4 {looks cute but truth be told it loses to Ke8 as avoiding mate on the
queenside is impossible. But also Magnus didn't want to get up from the board
and ask for another knight!} Ke8 29. bxa3 Rxa3+ 30. Kb1 Rda8 $1 $19) 28... Bxe5
(28... Kc7 29. Nxc4 $18) 29. Qxf5+ Kc7 30. Qxe5+ $1 Nxe5 31. Bxb3 axb2+ 32.
Kxb2 Nbd3+ 33. Kb1 Nxc1 (33... Ra3 34. Nb5+ $18) 34. Rxc1 {White is now
completely winning.} Kc8 35. dxc6 bxc6 36. f4 {A beautiful game with lot of
unusual moves. But when you think deeply about it, each and every move had a
clear purpose behind it. Computer engines might give White a clear edge since
the 17th move, but in a practical game when your king is under such an attack
it is not so simple.} 1-0
