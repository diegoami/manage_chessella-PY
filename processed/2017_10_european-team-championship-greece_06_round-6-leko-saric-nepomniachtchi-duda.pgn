mention:} (8... b5 {is unpopular as it allows White a favourable early a4:} 9.

Sveshnikov-type play in case of Nd5, and otherwise Black may consider ...d5, e.

favourably to the analogous variation of my Dragon sideline, 5...g6 6.Be3 Nc6

the same}) 12... Qc7 (12... Nb6 {has been played most, but a venomous
