deferred Steinitz defense, which was often played by Mamedyarov and Short once
upon a time!} 7. O-O Bg7 8. h3 Nf6 9. Re1 O-O 10. Nbd2 Re8 11. Bc2 {The
players are still following a lot of high-level games.} h6 $2 {I give this move
a mistake, not for the move but for the plan that black followed it up with} ({
The World Championship Challenger opted for a different line.} 11... Qe7 12. Nf1 Qf8 13. Ng3 a5

board, but it is already completely lost for Black! When I was watching the
game live, I could feel that Black couldn't get a feel for the position,
whereas White knew precisely what he was doing.  I will ask the viewers to
find the plan that Ray Robson used to increase his control of the f5 square!
Take a minute, and find the nuanced shuffling of pieces by Ray} 17. Nh2 c5 18.
Bd1 $1 c4 19. Bg4 Bxg4 20. Nxg4 {For amateurs, this position is an excellent
example of how to evaluate positions with equal material. White has a lot
of control over critical squares in the kingside, the knight on f4 is going to get
kicked out soon, and the attack is starting to brew now, and those are the
reasons why White is dominating in this position.} h5 21. Nf5 Qf8 22. Nh2 b5 23.
