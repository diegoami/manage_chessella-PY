1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg7 6. h3 Nf6 7. Nc3 O-O 8.
Be3 {This line was quite popular many years ago as Vishy said after the game.}
b6 9. Qd2 e5 10. Bh6 (10. Nxe5 Nxe4 $15) 10... Qd6 11. O-O-O a5 12. g4 a4 13.
Kb1 Be6 14. Ne2 b5 15. Ng3 Rfd8 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. Qg5 Nd7 18. Nf5+ Bxf5 19.
gxf5 {At this point Vishy was happy that there was something going on in the
position. It is still around even, but as you can see, with opposite side
castling the position is still quite sharp.} a3 20. b3 h6 21. Qg3 Kh7 22. Rhg1
Qf6 23. h4 gxf5 24. Qh3 $5 {Vishy sacrifices a pawn to get some play in return.
His queen is well placed and he can now think about doubling his rooks or
moving his knight to g5 square.} f4 {[%cal Gg1g2,Gg2g4,Gg4g5,Gf3g5]} 25. Rg5
Qe6 26. Rf5 {The rook on f5 is place in a quite threatening manner. There are
ideas like Ng5 in the air. Of course, with computer analysis you can be sure
that Black is better, but during the game it was all quite tense.} Rg8 $4 {
[%cal Gd8g8] This natural move turns out to be the crucial blunder. Vishy had
seen that he was winning.} (26... Kh8 {This is the move that Vishy and
Grischuk were discussing after the game.} 27. Qg4 (27. Rh1 f6 28. Ng5 fxg5 29.
hxg5 Rg8 $17 {This doesn't seem to work for White.}) 27... Nf6 28. Qg1 Rg8 $17)
(26... f6 $5 {is also interesting and seems to give White no attacking chances.
} 27. Ng5+ fxg5 28. hxg5 Qg6 $19 {Black is doing well.}) 27. Ng5+ $1 {[%cal
Gf3g5] The first minor jolt for Grischuk.} hxg5 28. Rxf7+ $1 {[%cal Gf5f7] The
big one! After this Grischuk was completely shocked.} Qxf7 29. hxg5+ Kg7 30.
Qh6# {It was quite sporting of Sasha to allow the mate. This game sealed the
tournament victory for Anand, especially because Mamedyarov lost to Dubov.} 1-0
