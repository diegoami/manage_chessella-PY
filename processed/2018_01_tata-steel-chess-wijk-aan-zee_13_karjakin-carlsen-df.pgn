{No Breyer today.} b4 (8... Bb7 {is more popular, but I have never understood
the appeal of developing the bishop to a diagonal that will remain closed, in
the case when the Breyeresque ...c5-c4 is still some moves off.} 9. d3 d6 10.
Nc3 {is White's point; Black's queenside pawns will not be permitted to
advance abreast. The best he might be able to do is} Na5 11. Ba2 b4 12. Ne2 c5
13. Ng3 g6 (13... Bc8 14. c3 Rb8 15. d4 $36 {Duda,J-Najer,E Czech Republic 2017
}) 14. h3 {when White appears to have extra tempi in his kingside attack,
compared to most systems with an early d3.}) (8... Rb8 {is slightly compliant:
after} 9. axb5 axb5 10. c3 d6 11. d4 {Black lacks the usual recourse of ...Na5
in the line} exd4 12. cxd4 Bg4 13. Be3 {so might have to make do with} d5 14.
e5 Ne4 15. h3 Bh5 16. Nc3 $36 {; furthermore, 13.Nc3!? might be unexpectedly
strong in spite of the doubled f-pawns.}) 9. d4 (9. a5 d6 10. d3 Be6 11. Bxe6
fxe6 12. Nbd2 {led to a nice win for Magnus himself in Carlsen,M-Aronian,L
Saint Louis 2017; one wonders where the improvement was?}) (9. d3 d6 10. Nbd2
Na5 11. Ba2 c5 12. c3 Rb8 {is now fine for Black, who has not wasted time on ..
.Bb7 unlike in the 8...Bb7 line.}) 9... d6 10. dxe5 Nxe5 11. Nxe5 (11. Nbd2
Ned7 $5 {was an unusual method of pressuring e4, but a successful one:} 12. Nd4
Bb7 13. c3 bxc3 14. bxc3 Nc5 15. Bc2 Re8 16. f3 Nfd7 17. a5 d5 $11 {Nakamura,
H-Svidler,P Saint Louis 2017}) 11... dxe5 12. Qe2 a5 {Possibly still affected
by his own experience on the White side, Carlsen decides to avoid White's a5
ideas.} (12... Bc5 {is of course fine immediately}) 13. Nd2 Bc5 14. Nf3 Qe7 15.
Be3 Ba6 16. Bxc5 Qxc5 17. Qe3 Qxe3 18. Rxe3 Rfe8 $11 {Initially this position
looked to me to be slightly nicer for White, but this isn't really the case.
In fact, Black may have more ideas in the position, and in the long term has
the better bishop, so it would not surprise me if he was vaguely thinking
about winning here.} 19. c3 (19. h3 c5 20. Rd1 c4 21. Ba2 Kf8 $132 {is hard to
get enthused about from the White side, especially if we remember
Adhiban-Carlsen from round 2.}) 19... Ng4 20. Ng5 {Simplifying quickly lest he
end up worse.} Nxe3 21. Bxf7+ Kf8 22. Bxe8 Rxe8 23. fxe3 bxc3 24. bxc3 h6 25.
Nf3 Bd3 26. Rd1 Bxe4 27. Rd7 {Continuing to force pieces off, because if White
plays slowly the bishop will be superior.} Re7 28. Rd8+ (28. Rxe7 Kxe7 29. Nxe5
Ke6 30. Nc4 Kd5 31. Nxa5 Bc2 {leads to an odd position where White is a pawn
up but only he is taking risks.}) 28... Kf7 29. Nd2 Bc6 30. Nc4 Ke6 31. Nxa5
Bxa4 32. Nb7 Re8 (32... Bd7 {might be a try if Black is desperate to play on.}
33. e4 (33. Nc5+ Kd6 34. Ne4+ Kc6 35. Kf2 Be8 $132) 33... Rf7 34. Nc5+ Kd6 35.
Nd3 c5 $132 {Objectively this might be nothing for Black, and so there is no
reason to go for it, especially if one has looked at Anish Giri's game and
concluded he is unlikely to win.}) 33. Nc5+ Kf6 34. Rxe8 $11 {Unlike the
previous note, here White gets to play Na6 immediately, and thus seal up the
whole position.} 1/2-1/2
