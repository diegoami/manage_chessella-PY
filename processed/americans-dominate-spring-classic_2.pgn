Nd2 (13. Bb2 { was Wesley's choice}) 13... Nxc3 14. Qxc3 Nf6 15. Bb2 Bd7 $5 {An interesting way to develop. Black puts the bishop on d7 so that aggressive ideas on the kingside have a bigger punch, as the bishop can reroute through e8 to the kingside.} 16. Rac1 g4 {In a practical game, sometimes it isn't so obvious to see how to defend against h5, h4 and mate on the kingside!} 17. f3 $6 {a bit of panic that weakens White's position in the longterm.} h5 18. Bh1 h4 19. Qd3 hxg3 20. hxg3 Rf7 {Black is able ot increase the pressure while always having resources against White's break} 21. Rf2 (21. e4 gxf3 22. exd5 cxd5 (22... Qb8 $5) 23.
