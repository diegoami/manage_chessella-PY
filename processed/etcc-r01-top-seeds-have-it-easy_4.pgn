Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Bd6 5. Ne2 a6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. d3 Qe7 8. e4 Be6 9. O-O O-O-O $5 {Combative play by Wagner. It would have been normal to just 0-0.} 10. Nd2 h5 11. b4 h4 12. a4 Nh5 (12... h3 $1 {was the faster way to reach the gates of White's castle.} 13. g3 Bxb4 14. Bxe5 Bg4 {With superior co-ordination, although the game is still by no means over.}) 13. b5 $1 {Good or bad, lines have to be opened!} cxb5 14. axb5 axb5 15. Ra5 c6 {Black has won a pawn and is objectively better. But in a practical game White has good chances as there are open lines leading to the black king.} 16. Qa1 f6 17. d4 Bb4 18. Ba3 $1 Kc7 19. d5 {Richard mixes up things in the position. Apart from the wierd pin on the b4 bishop, now the d5 pawn has moved ahead to sacrifice itself in order to open lines.} Bg4 20. Nc3 Bxa3 (20... Nf4 $5 {is clearly better for Black but difficult to understand why. Black now threatens moves like Qc5 with a threat of taking on c3 and then a fork on e2 could be a real possibility. In general the kinght is really well placed on f4.}) 21. Rxa3 (21. Qxa3 Qxa3 22. Rxa3 b4 $19) 21... Bd7 $2 (21... b4 $2 {Now this doesn't work due to} 22. Ra7 $1 bxc3 23. Rxb7+ $1 Kxb7 24. Rb1+ Kc7 25. Qa7+ Kd6 26. Nc4#) ( 21... Nf4 {was required as after} 22. Ra7 Qc5 23. Qa5+ Qb6 24. Qa2 Qc5 {the game ends in a draw.}) 22. Ra7 $1 Rb8 (22... Qc5 23. Qa5+ Qb6 {no longer works due to} 24. d6+ $1 {and now you see why retreating the bishop to d7 was bad!}) 23. Qa5+ Kc8 24. dxc6 (24. Na4 $1 {was the finishing stroke.} bxa4 25. Nc4 $1 Bg4 26. d6 Qf7 27. Nb6+ Kd8 28. Ra8 $18) 24... Bxc6 25. Nxb5 Qd8 $1 {Good defence.} 26. Qc3 Nf4 27. Re1 Kd7 28. Qb3 Qb6 (28... Ke7 {was better but its not so easy to keep your cool in such wild positions.}) 29. Qf7+ $1 Kd8 30. Qxg7 Re8 31. Qxf6+ Kd7 {It's almost a miracle that Black survived this. He is unconditionally lost.} 32. Nc4 $1 Qxb5 33. Rd1+ $1 Kc7 34. Qf7+ $1 Bd7 35. Nd6 (35. Ra5 {was faster as after} Qc6 36. Rc5 $18 {the queen is lost or the king is mated.}) 35... Nh3+ 36. Kh1 Qe2 37. Nxe8+ Kb6 38. Qb3+ (38. Rd6+ Kxa7 39. Qa2+ $18) 38... Bb5 39. Raa1 $2 (39. Rxb7+ Rxb7 40. Qe6+ Bc6 (40... Ka7 41. Ra1+ Ba6 42. Qxh3 $18 {was still winning.}) 41. Rb1+ Ka7 42. Ra1+ Kb6 43. Qb3+ Bb5 44. gxh3 $18) 39... Nxf2+ 40. Kg1 Nxd1 {Now White will do well to take a perpetual check.} 41. Qe6+ Bc6 42. Rb1+ Ka7 43. Ra1+ Kb6 44. Rb1+ Ka7 45. Ra1+ Kb6 46. Rb1+ {A very interesting game. This analysis by no means shows all the possibilities for both sides. There were just too many. It just gives you an idea of how crazy a game of chess can be!} 1/2-1/2
