Well, the databases reveal that this was the first time! Adhiban has seriously made some very interesting choices at this event. Rather than going deep into some line, he has just changed the battlefield in order to make it more even.} exf4 {44} 3. Bc4 {0} (3. Nf3 {is by far the most popular move in the position.}) 3... d5 {405 Played after seven minutes of thought. Wesley would have definitely prepared something against the King's Gambit but to remember all the analysis on the spot is not an easy task.} (3... Qh4+ 4. Kf1 {The tempo that you will gain with Nf3 is worth losing your castling rights!}) 4. Bxd5 {0} Nf6 {8} 5. Nc3 {0} Nxd5 {566} 6. Nxd5 {0} Bd6 {8 } (6... g5 {is another possible move, but Wesley likes to go for simple developing moves rather than clinging on to pawns with moves like g5.}) 7. Nf3 {0} O-O {17} 8. d4 {0 Adhiban was still blitzing his moves.} Re8 {905 15 minutes of thought! The opening is already a success for the Indian player.} 9. e5 {4} c6 {7} (9... f6 10. Bxf4 $14) 10. Nxf4 {54 White has not only recovered his pawn, but is a pawn up and has a clearly preferable position. Getting such a position against Wesley after 10 moves in any major well-known opening line might be almost impossible.} f6 {38} 11. Nd3 {712 The first move where Adhiban had to think. 12 minutes for 11.Nd3.} (11. O-O $5 fxe5 12. dxe5 Bc5+ 13. Kh1 Qxd1 14. Rxd1 Bf5 $44) (11. Qd3 $5 fxe5 12. dxe5 Bc7 13. Qb3+ Kh8 14.

O-O {196} Qa6 {14 White is a pawn up, but Black's bishop pair and the pretty weak e5 pawn gives Black decent compensation.} (16... Bxd3 17. Qxd3 Bxe5 18. Ng5 $1 g6 19. Qc4+ Qd5 20. Qh4 $18 ) 17. Rad1 {244} Nd7 {7} (17... Qxa2 18. Ng5 Bg6 19. Nf4 $18) 18. Bd4 {1568 Adhiban played after 26 minutes, but this move lets Black equalize with ease.} (18. b3 $5 Bxd3 19. Rxd3 Nxe5 20.
