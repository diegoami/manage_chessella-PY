Nge2 {(12s) Not long ago this year, Navara lost a crucial game in European championship to Inarkiev, in the very same line.} Re8 {(498s)} 8. O-O {(12s)} Bd6 {( 191s)} (8... Bf8 {was Inarkiev's choice, and we will not get to see Navara's improvement is...at least this time!} 9. Bd2 b6 10. Nf4 Bb7 11. Qf3 a6 12. Rad1 Ra7 13. Bc2 c5 14. dxc5 bxc5 15. Qh3 g6 16.

Rc1 {(335s)} b6 {(347s) Stefansson, follows Inarkiev's idea, with the difference of having his bishop on d6.} 11. Ng3 $1 {(304s)} c5 {(256s)} 12. Bb1 {(779s) Now it is clear why the bishop is better on f8: in case of Nf5, the bishop on d6 will not be under attack and Black can parry any attack on the kingside by means of g6.} Be6 { (348s)} 13. dxc5 {(695s)} Bxc5 {(364s)} 14. Nce2 {(668s) This is not one of those 'isolated' d-pawns. Black's pieces are not correctly placed and his a6-b6 pawns moves are just permanent weaknesses.} Nbd7 {(143s)} 15. Bc3 { (33 s)} Bd6 {(350s)} 16. Nd4 {(605s)} Rc8 {(223s)} 17. Qe2 {(684s)} b5 {(165s)} 18. Nxe6 {(90s)} fxe6 {( 39s)} 19. e4 {(9s)} Bf4 $6 {(363s) There is no need for this provocative move.

Now White has all of his pieces mobalized for a kingside attack. The bishop on b1 will turn into a monster very soon.} Qb6+ $2 {(53s) This just makes things worse.} 23.

Although, we should admit that Stefansson did really make only one mistake, nevertheless it was enough for Navara to wrap up the game convincingly. With this win, Navara sealed the deal in Czech's favor 3-1 against Iceland!} 1-0
