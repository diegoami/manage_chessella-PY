Black may be better, sure, but outright losing?} (25. Qd1 {is the next big question: can Black win if White refuses to play along?} Qb4 26. b3 Qd2 27.

It brings the took into play where it will be able to wreak havoc. So long as White is able to lock the position up and prevent the rook from penetrating, the chances to hold are very good, but once it is able to leverage its long range ability, White has little hope.} 29.
