{The position and story (see the main text) is taken from the book
"Begebenheiten am Schachbrett" by Albin Pötzsch, a great German columnist in
the vein of Kurt Richter or Dr. Tröger. The book collects (in German) many of
his columns from "Schach-Magazin 64", the magazine of Otto Borik. My source's
original column was first published in 2011, but Pötzsch usually reports
accurately based on the big chess library he has at home. - Master Alekhine
was to move, hoping for the variation, but due to his opponent's confusion
lost.} 1. e6 Nxe6 $1 ({Alekhine hoped for} 1... fxe6 2. dxe6 Nxe6 3. Nxe6 Bxe6

that the endgame was already a draw after 3.-B:e6, making this an example of
the Réti maneuver. However, there is more as shown below.}) (1... fxe6 2. dxe6

up with} 4... Kxf6 5. Kf4 Bf5 $19 {and the extra Ph3 does not matter. White
never can reach a1.}) 5. Kf4 a4 6. Ke5 Bd7 $3 ({or similarly} 6... Bb3 $19) ({
Alekhine thought that the bishop must move and it is a draw because of} 6... a3
7. Kxe6 a2 8. f7 $11 {but as we will see, even with the bishop moving Black
can win.}) 7. Kd4 (7. Kd6 Kxf6 $19) 7... a3 8. Kc3 Ba4 $1 $19 {. Interestingly
for this bishop setup (Ba4/Pa3, with reversed colors) J. Gunst won the 1st
prize in the Helsinki Chess Club tourney (for endgame studies) 1926. So it
seems that Gunst "invented" it 12 years after this game, with Alekhine not
finding it in his analysis. This shows that Alekhine missed not one but two
opportunities for endgame studies immortality by not creating such
compositions from the possibilities in this game. For someone who always
complained on how his opponents restricted him from showing his ideas, this
would have been an obvious step to take - why he didn't, we might never know.})

{(S.S. 1) This study, becoming famous after re-publication in "Kagans Neueste
Schachnachrichten" April-June 1922, has White to move and draw, seemingly
impossible. We apologize as likely every reader already knows this study, but
it had to be included for context and as it is Réti's most famous study. While
it is true that a modification of this, a later version, is included in the
earlier article by master Benkö, this original version is the most famous, and
as such worth showing here, also in the article's context.} 1. Kg7 $1 h4 ({The

{(S.S. 48) This study won the first semester 1938 tourney of Shakhmaty and has
become widely reprinted but likely won't be known to everyone. White is to
move and win, and with Black threatening to play 1.-Be5 to rely on winning the
queen which can't move because of checkmate on h8 this is not easy.} 1. Kh6 $1

{(S.S. 49) We use the remaining place to show two of Réti's studies that don't
fit in specific categories. From Mandler's book we learn that this is one of
the earlier works of Réti, poising White to move and win, showing an
interesting example of domination, i.e. the conquer of a seemingly free piece.

{(S. S. 50) "The great study no.50 unites in the luckiest way two separate
ideas, of which one has the echo lines as content while the second [...] finds
its echo in a third variation. The construction is of comforting simplicity
and harmony. Réti, probably justified, believed this construction to be his
best." (Mandler, Sämtliche Studien von Richard Réti, my translation) - While
the book did not always have all sources, today we know that this correction
appeared in the Tijdschrft v.d. KNSB 7/1929. See the header for the original
publication source. White is to move and win, and this is indeed beautifully
accomplished by many variations in which Black is forced to exchange the rooks.
