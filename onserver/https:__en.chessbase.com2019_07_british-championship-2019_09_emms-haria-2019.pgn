{[#]} 1... Qb6 $2 {Black was already under pressure, but moving away from the
kingside invites trouble.} (1... Qe7 2. Rf3 Nb6 {would have kept Black fairly
solid in this Fort Knox set-up.}) 2. h4 $1 {Emms responds thematically,
creating all kinds of new attacking chances. All of a sudden Black is probably
already losing.} Bg7 3. h5 Qb3 (3... Nf6 {Allows the sacrificial continuation}
4. hxg6 hxg6 5. Bxg6 {which is too obvious for White to miss.}) 4. Qh4 (4. hxg6
hxg6 (4... fxg6 5. Bg5 Qxb2 6. Bc4 $1) 5. Qh4 {is probably not unlike what
happens in the game, as Black has huge problems down the h-file.}) 4... Bf6 5.
Qg4 Bg7 6. hxg6 hxg6 7. Rh3 $2 (7. Qh4 $1 {transposing to the line given above,
intending Rh3 with a mating attack.}) 7... e5 $1 {Ravi is alert and seizes his
only chance} 8. dxe5 {[#]} Nf8 $2 {Tempting, as this looks like it holds for
the time being, but without taking on e5 Black is only really playing with his
queen, which is not enough to create counterplay against the inevitable White
attack.} ({the only way was to dive into the calculations pool with} 8... Nxe5
$1 9. Bxe5 (9. Qh4 Nf3+ $1 (9... Nxd3 $2 10. Qh7+ Kf8 11. Bd6+ {leads to
trouble.}) 10. gxf3 Rxe1+ 11. Kg2 Qe6 {should hold comfortably for Black}) 9...
Rxe5 (9... Bxe5 $2 10. Rxe5 Rxe5 11. Bxg6 $1 $18) 10. Rxe5 Bxe5 11. Bxg6 $1 Kf8
$1 {the only move, where Black can escape into a bad, but possibly holdable
position, although after} 12. Re3 {White retains a huge advantage.}) 9. Qh4 (9.
Qg3 $1 {with the simple plan of Bh6 followed by mate down the h-file, was
perhaps even stronger.} Qxb2 10. Bc4 b5 11. axb5 cxb5 12. Bh6 $3) 9... Qxa4 10.
b3 $1 Qxb3 11. Bh6 Rxe5 12. Bxg7 Rh5 13. Qf6 ({another option was} 13. Qd4 Ne6
(13... Rxh3 14. gxh3 Qd5 15. Qxd5 cxd5 16. Be5 {admittedly presents some
technical issues for White}) 14. Rxe6 $18) 13... Nh7 {[#]} 14. Qe7 $4 {This
was move 29 and Emms cracks here completely in the time scramble.} (14. Qf4 $1
Rxh3 15. gxh3 Kxg7 16. Bc4 {was still completely winning.} Qxc3 17. Qxf7+ Kh6
