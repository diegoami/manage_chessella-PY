round, Nikolov decided to play it steady with the Petroff.} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3

the more common approach by White.}) 8... Be6 9. Qe2 Qd7 10. O-O-O O-O { The

enough to keep the balance.} Ne5 $1 26. Nxe5 Rxe5 $11) 25... Bxg5 26. Qxg5 Rxe1
27. Rxe1 Re8 $1 {Simply play by Nikolov. He simply exchanges the rooks and
tells White that he has simply overextended his position.} 28. Re3 ( 28. Rxe8+

advantage in this endgame.}) 28... Rxe3 29. fxe3 (29. Qxe3 Qxg4 { is not
advisable.}) 29... Qe6 {This is the true strength of Petroff. Black has
excellent structure and well centralized pieces. All that White is left are
weaknesses and weak pawns.} 30. Qf4 Ne5 31. Nxe5 dxe5 (31... Qxe5 32. Kc2 $15)

$1 {In queen endgames it is very important that you try to create outside
passed pawns. Now the h-pawn is a real trump for Black.} 38. hxg5 Kg6 39. Kd2
Qxg5 40. Qh3 Qg4 {Although material is even, Black seems to have an extra pawn
because of White's doubled pawns on the queenside.} 41. Qh2 Qe4 42. Qg3+ Kh6

on.} 48. Qh7 Qf2+ 49. Kc3 h2 {In such positions it might seem that White will
have lot of checks, but the checks end at some point and the black king finds
safety behind the white pawns.} 50. Qg7+ Kh4 51. Qe7+ Kh3 52. Qe6+ Kh4 53. Qe7+

argue that Momchil did nothing special in this game. But not making bad moves
is also an art! As Jonathon Rowson puts it, being in chess is just as important
as doing!} (58... Kh3 59. Qh5+ Kg2 $19) 0-1
