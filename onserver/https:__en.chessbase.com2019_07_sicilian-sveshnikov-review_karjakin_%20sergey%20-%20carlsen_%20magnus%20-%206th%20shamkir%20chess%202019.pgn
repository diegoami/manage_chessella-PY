{My focus was fully on this game. Karjakin is a very ambitious man these days,
and I knew that he would fight to the death against Magnus today. What I
didn't expect however, was Magnus being so co-operative and allowing a full
blooded fight!} 1. e4 c5 $1 {Smart move. The World Champion adheres to his
favourite Sveshnikov, even in a game that the opponent needs to win. This
shows that in principle, one should stick to his preparation for every game,
and aim to win, irrespective of the requirement.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4
Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5 {Karjakin goes for Caruana's main line against
Carlsen in their match last year. This is a very interesting try for White,
and play now takes on a very definite character-White tries to breakthrough on
the queenside, and Black tries to thwart that and checkmate the White king.}
Nxd5 8. exd5 Ne7 9. c4 Ng6 10. Qa4 Bd7 11. Qb4 Bf5 12. Qa4 Bd7 13. Qb4 Bf5 14.
h4 $1 {Sergey needs to win, and he shows the first important ingredient of a
winner- the motivation to fight. This is the best move, as already played by
Fabi last year, avoiding the same repetition Magnus proposed.} h5 $1 {This is
an important move, weakening g5, but taking g4 under firm control.} 15. Bg5 Qb8
16. Be2 a6 17. Nc3 Qc7 18. g3 Be7 19. Be3 e4 20. O-O (20. Bb6 $5 Qd7 21. Bd4 $5
{is an interesting maneuver, but it forces the queen to go where it wants to
go. So, Sergey's decision in the game is correct.}) (20. Bd4 $5 {immediately
is also interesting.} Ne5 21. Qa4+ Bd7 (21... Kf8 $5 {is also interesting-
White is forced to play} 22. Bxe5 dxe5 23. Qc2 Rh6 $1 24. Rc1 b5 $1 $132 {
with counterplay for Black.}) 22. Qb4 f5 $1 23. O-O Rc8 24. Rac1 Bf6 $13 {
with an unclear position, where White's chances are slightly better.}) 20...
O-O $1 {Superb pawn sacrifice from Magnus. It is only after this point that
Stockfish and other engines show white an advantage of one tempo only. This
proves that the flow of the game has now started to go in Black's favour.} 21.
Bxh5 {There is nothing else. White has to take it and prove material is more
important.} Ne5 22. Be2 Qd7 23. Qa4 Qc8 {Sergey must have felt a little
desperate by now. Magnus has equalised, and the tide has slowly turned in the
latter's favour. The game might be equal, but the momentum is on Black's side,
and that is most important.} 24. c5 $5 {An interesting attempt to mix things
up.} (24. Qd1 $5 {is a radical attempt by White to accelerate his queenside
play.} Re8 $1 {is far better, continuing the kingside policy. After} ({If
Black bites with} 24... Nxc4 {then} 25. Bd4 $1 Nxb2 26. Qd2 Nd3 27. Nxe4 $1 Nc5
28. Nxc5 dxc5 29. Be5 $13 {leads to a very complex middlegame, where I feel
White's chances are slightly better.}) 25. Bd4 Bf6 $1 (25... Nxc4 $5 26. Na4 $1
Bh3 27. Re1 Bd8 28. Rc1 {White should be atleast slightly better here, having
reduced the pressure on his kingside somewhat.}) 26. Re1 Bg6 27. Rc1 Rb8 28. b4
$1 {looks as if it puts White in the driver's seat, but Black has the amazing}
Bxh4 $3 29. gxh4 Qh3 $44 {with atleast perpetual check.}) 24... dxc5 $1 {
Magnus plays most aggressively.} 25. Nxe4 c4 $1 {It was around here that
Carlsen mentions in the press conference that he was very happy with his
position and wanted to play on. I surely agree. Black is risking nothing
here-most of his pieces are optimally placed. Sergey now commits the first
mistake.} 26. Nc3 $2 {Unnecessarily gifting Black some play on the queenside.}
(26. Qc2 $1 {according to Magnus was essential, and after} Re8 27. Rad1 Bf8 28.
Kh2 b5 $132 {we reach a position with mutual chances.}) 26... b5 $1 27. Qd1 b4
$1 28. Na4 $17 {The knight now sits like a lone ranger, unable to create
enough play on its own.} Be4 $1 {Sergey probably underestimated this resource.
Black now quickly gets his queen to the kingside.} 29. Qd4 Qf5 {Magnus has a
very comfortable edge here.} 30. f4 $2 {The last straw.} (30. f3 $1 {was a
must, sacrificing a pawn, but opening up the rook and creating some
counterchances. After} Nxf3+ $1 31. Bxf3 Bxf3 32. Nb6 Rad8 33. Qd1 $1 Bxd1 34.
Rxf5 Bc2 35. Rf2 b3 $17 {Black's advantage is big, but not decisive.}) 30...
Qg6 $1 {After this it is more or less over- White's kingside is too weak.} 31.
Bf2 Nd3 32. h5 Qf5 33. Bg4 $2 {Another mistake.} (33. Bxd3 cxd3 34. Qe5 Qxe5
35. fxe5 Bxd5 $19 {is also hopeless, but more defensible for White.}) 33...
Qxg4 $1 34. Qxe4 Bd6 $1 {Magnus now finishes in style.} 35. Qg2 Rae8 36. Bd4
Qxh5 37. Qf3 Qg6 38. Kh1 Re4 39. Bf2 Rfe8 {and Karjakin resigned. A great
counterpunching game by the World Champion, who is back to his dominant best
in Classical Chess.} 0-1
