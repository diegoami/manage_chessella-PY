Artemiev in a game in the World Blitz Championship in 2016 so Black would have
been ready for it.}) 8... Ne4 (8... Nc6 {was the continuation in

later.}) 15. Nd2 Rb8 16. Rb1 b6 17. Bxc5 {A bit surprising to give up bishop
for knight like this, without being obliged to do so. I was momentarily
reminded of Kurt Richter: I've been reading a splendid new biographical work
on Richter, published by McFarland, and Richter had a thing about swapping
bishops off for knights. More likely Artemiev was concerned about securing his
grip on e4.} Bxc5 18. Qa4 Bg4 19. Bf3 Bh3 {[#]} 20. Qxa7 $5 {This exchange for
pawn sacrifice is not foreseen by engines which prefer to preserve the f1 rook.
But, with White's light-squared bishop patrolling the long diagonal it makes
sense.} Bxf1 21. Kxf1 Re7 22. Qa4 Qd7 23. Rb5 Qa7 24. Qb3 Kg7 25. a4 Ra8 $2 {
Watching the game in the press room, IM Tania Sachdev was incredulous when she
saw this move on the board. It's become obvious that White has good
compensation for the exchange for pawn sacrifice but giving back the material
lands Black with the problem of being a pawn down and also some positional
problems, such as the dark-squared bishop being little better than a big pawn.}
26. Bxa8 Qxa8 27. f3 Ra7 ({Black hasn't time to keep the knight out of e4 with
} 27... f5 {because of} 28. a5 $1 {and a second pawn is lost.}) 28. Ne4 {
White can't save the a-pawn but he can retaliate by taking the b-pawn in two
moves' time, and then retaining the extra pawn with a number of sharp threats.
Black is already lost.} Rxa4 29. Nxc5 bxc5 30. Rxc5 Ra3 31. Qb4 Ra4 32. Qb6

Black's last move was a desperate trick hoping for} 34. dxe4 $2 Qa3 $1 {
and Black escapes with half a point. But White is not obliged to take on e4.})
34... e3+ 35. Kg2 Qa7 36. Qxa7 Rxa7 37. f4 {Black resigned as he will soon be
two or even three pawns down for nothing.} 1-0
