1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 b6 3. Nc3 Bb7 4. d4 e6 5. a3 d5 6. Bg5 Be7 7. e3 O-O 8. Rc1 {
Magnus chooses the rare moves of the Petrosian line and already here I started
to think...} h6 {Not the most common move, which was evaluated differently!} 9.
Bxf6 Bxf6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. Bd3 c5 12. O-O {I heard different evaluations of
this position. Aronian told me that this is a famous position from the Queen's
Gambit with an extra tempo for White, but Magnus said that the position is
absolutely harmless for Black...} Na6 {Preparing Nc7-e6, but later the knight
went another way...} 13. Ne5 {Interesting try, White is preparing f2-f4. I
expected more Ne2 and then Ng3 or Nf4. Also possible was Bb1 with an unclear
position.} cxd4 14. exd4 Bxe5 ({The interesting alternative} 14... Nc5 {
seemed quite risky to me in view of} 15. Nxf7 ({A quieter move is} 15. f4)
15... Rxf7 16. dxc5 bxc5 17. Qh5 {and for the human the position looks very
dangerous with such a weak diagonal b1-h7.}) 15. dxe5 Nc5 16. Re1 $1 {The only
one try to fight for an advantage!} (16. Nb5 Nxd3 17. Qxd3 Ba6 $11 {is fine
for Black, for example:} 18. f4 Rc8 19. Rce1 $6 {Trying to play for a win.} ({
White should make a draw after} 19. Rxc8 Qxc8 20. Qxd5 Qc5+ 21. Qxc5 bxc5 22.

move White is not fighting for an advantage any longer!} ({White should have
played} 17. Bf1 a6 {Black should cover the b5-square.} 18. Rc2 $1 {keeping a
minimal advantage.}) 17... d4 18. Ne4 $2 {Almost the decisive mistake! After
this move White gets a very bad position...} (18. Nb5 Qd5 19. Rc2 Nxd3 20. Qxd3
Ba6 21. a4 Bxb5 22. axb5 Rac8 {with a draw.}) 18... Bxe4 19. Bxe4 d3 $1 {
Nice move, which because of the inclusion 16...Re8 17.f4 now works!} 20. Rc4 {
I also thought this is the strongest, but the lesser evil was 20.Re3.} (20.

16...Re8 17.f4.}) 20... Rc8 21. Bf5 Qd5 {Also strong was 21...b5, but I wanted
my b6-pawn to support the knight on c5.} 22. Rc3 Rcd8 23. Qd2 Qd4+ 24. Kh1 (24.
Kf1 a5 {was equally bad for White.}) 24... a5 $1 {Playing against b4.} 25. Rb1
{It was hard to suggest anything instead...} a4 26. Rd1 Rd5 {This is a bit too
much! Of course Black's position was very good, but why not just win an
exchange by playing} (26... g6 $1 27. Bxd3 Ne4 28. Bxe4 Qxd2 29. Rxd2 Rxd2 $19
{with an easy win!}) 27. h4 g6 ({A stronger try was} 27... Red8 28. h5 f6 $19 {
and White is defenceless!}) 28. Bxd3 Red8 29. Qe1 Qxf4 30. e6 $1 Nxe6 (30...

defending very well!} b5 ({The strongest was} 31... Nd4 $1 32. Bxa4 Nf5 33.

decided to play safer...}) 32. Rxd5 Rxd5 33. Re3 Nd4 34. Bd3 (34. Bxg6 {
does not work:} fxg6 35. Re8+ Kg7 36. Re7+ Kf6 $19) 34... Kg7 35. Kg1 Qf6 36.
Kh2 ({More stubborn was} 36. Qf2 Nf5 (36... Qd6 $5) 37. Bxf5 Rxf5 38. Rf3 Rxf3

required.}) 36... Rh5 {Playing in mutual time trouble.} ({It was even stronger
to play} 36... Rc5 $1 {and Black is dominating!}) 37. Rh3 ({There was the
slightly more stubborn} 37. Re4) 37... Ne6 {Here Black had many ways, but
before the time control I chose the most human moves...} (37... Qf4+ 38. Qg3

me...} 42. Re3 Rd4 43. Bb5 Kf6 44. Rf3+ (44. Bxa4 bxa3 45. Rxa3 Rd2+ $19) 44...

king will go to h2, the endgame is completely hopeless for White!} 59. Rb4 h5
