1. e4  e5  2. Nf3  Nc6  3. Bc4  Bc5  4. O-O  Nf6  5. d3  d6  6. c3  a6  7. Re1 
O-O  8. Bb3  h6  9. Nbd2  Ng4 {(873s) A surprise no doubt for Inarkiev. While
the databases do have this as the third most played move, it bears mentioning:
not by grandmasters! The most common here are Ba7, Be6, or Re8.} 10. Re2  Kh8
{(6s) Hou Yifan is hardly camouflaging her intent. Kh8 is to free the f-pawn
from its pin. Which begs the question, why did White choose to force Black's
hand with...} 11. h3 $6 { (0s) The engines can say this move is fine, but I
don't like it on principle. Why not let Black show her hand first, and instead
continue development with Nf1?} ({If after} 11. Nf1 {Black still plays} f5
{then} 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. d4 $1 {is fine for White.}) 11... f5  12. exf5  Nxf2 
13. Rxf2  Bxf2+  14. Kxf2  Bxf5 {(9s) Black definitely has compensation, and
the question is now who will be able to make the most of this imbalanced
position?} 15. Qe2  d5  16. Kg1  Qd6  17. Bc2  Rf7  18. b4  a5  19. Bb2  axb4 
20. cxb4  Nxb4  21. Nxe5  Re7  22. Ndf3  Kg8  23. Qd2  Nxc2  24. Qxc2  c5  25.
Qb3  Kh7  26. Kh1 $2 {(0s) A blunder! Now Black is winning.} d4 $1  27. Bc1 
({The point is that after a move such as} 27. Nc4 {Black continues} Qg3 28. Ng1
Rae8 {and clearly the extra rook is far stronger than White's two pieces})
27... Rxe5  28. Bf4  Qd5 $1 {[#] (38s)} 29. Rb1  ({The idea is that after} 29.
Bxe5 Qxb3 {wins since the pawn is pinned to protect the rook on a1}) 29... Qxb3
 30. Rxb3  Rd5  31. Ne5  Rxa2  32. Rxb7  Re2  33. g4  Be6  34. Nc4  Rd8  0-1
