1.c4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2 Be7 5.0-0 0-0 6.b3 c5 7.Bb2 Nc6 8.e3 b6 9.Nc3 Bb7 10.d3 Rc8 11.Rc1 Rc7 12.Qe2 Rd7 13.Rfd1 Re8 {Here Botvinnik spotted a method to change the pawn structure in his favour, exploiting Black's temporarily awkward major pieces, particularly the queen on d8 and the rook on d7.} 14.cxd5 Nxd5 ( 14...exd5 15.Bh3 Rc7 16.Nb5 {wins the exchange.} ) 15.Nxd5 Rxd5 ( 15...exd5 16.d4 {leads to a pleasant hanging pawns structure for White. Larsen avoids changing the pawn structure radically, but the awkward position of the rook on d5 gives White a large number of attacking tempi.} ) 16.d4 Qa8 17.dxc5 {Seemingly the prelude to dull exchanges, but this is anything but the case!} 17...Rxd1+ 18.Rxd1 Bxc5 19.Ng5 {Threatening 20.Qh5 or 20.Qc2.} 19...h6 20.Ne4 {As Marin points out, this is the first time that Botvinnik rejects a tactical solution to the position, preferring a very strong positional idea instead.} ( {He could have played} 20.Nxf7 Kxf7 21.Qg4 Bf8 {, and now the very strong idea} 22.Be4 {threatening 23. Qg6+. The key point is that Black cannot bring the knight closer to the kingside:} 22...Ne7 ( 22...Qc8 23.Qg6+ Kg8 24.Qh7+ Kf7 25.Bg6+ Ke7 26.Bxg7 {and wins} ) 23.Qf3+ {picks up the bishop on b7.} ) 20...Bf8 21.Rd7 ( {The second time that Botvinnik could have calculated a tactical solution to the position. However, the move played is again an extremely strong positional move, establishing the rook on the seventh rank and asking Black to take ever more desperate measures to counter White's renewed threat of} 21.Nf6+ {.} ) ( {Here the tactical solution was} 21.Nf6+ gxf6 22.Qg4+ Kh7 23.Be4+ f5 24.Bxf5+ exf5 25.Qxf5+ Kg8 26.Qg4+ ( 26.Qf6 Ne5) 26...Kh7 27.Rd7 {, with the key idea} 27...Ne7 28.Rxe7 Rxe7 29.Qf5+ Kg8 30.Qf6 Kh7 31.g4 {followed by 32.Qh8+ and 33.Qg8 mate.} ) 21...f5 22.Nd6 Bxd6 23.Rxd6 {Marin shows that this is the third moment that Botvinnik eschews a tactical win, preferring a simple positional move that increases White's control over the dark squares.} ( 23.Rxg7+ Kf8 24.Rh7 {was the win that Botvinnik found after the game - 25. Qh5 is threatened and Black cannot defend the seventh rank with} 24...Re7 {, due to} 25.Rh8+ {.} ) 23...Nd4 24.Rxd4 Bxg2 25.Rd7 Bh3 ( {As Marin shows,} 25...Bh1 {would have given Black some (shaky) chances to grovel on after} 26.f4 ( 26.f3 Qxf3 27.Rxg7+ Kf8 28.Qd2 e5 29.Rxa7 Qc6 {is, amazingly, still not over for Black!} ) 26...e5 27.Bxe5 Rc8 28.Rxg7+ Kf8 29.Rc7 Rxc7 30.Bxc7 Qd5 {. This is not easy for White to win, as Marin points out.} ) 26.f3 Rd8 27.Rxg7+ Kf8 28.Rh7 Qd5 29.Kf2 Qd1 30.Rh8+ Kf7 31.Rxd8 Qxd8 32.Qc2 Qd5 33.Qc7+ Ke8 34.Qb8+ Kd7 35.Qxa7+ Kc8 36.Qa6+ Kc7 37.Qc4+ Qxc4 38.bxc4 Kc6 39.Bd4 h5 40.a4 Kc7 41.c5 bxc5 42.Bxc5 Kc6 43.Bb4 Kb6 44.g4 hxg4 45.Kg3 e5 46.e4 fxe4 47.fxg4 {Black resigned.} 1-0
