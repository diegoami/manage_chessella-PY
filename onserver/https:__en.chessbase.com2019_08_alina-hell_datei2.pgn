providential.} 22... Nxf2 {A bit too optimistic and refuted accurately by
White.} ({New opportunities would have appeared after} 22... a5 $1 {Creating

{During the game I thought I was not doing so bad with Black but once the
engine was turned on, I was proven completely wrong. Here, however, I could
have equalized with...?} 14... Qc8 {Not the right answer.} ({I considered}

properly assess the outcome.} 15. Qe2 Nc2 16. Rad1 Bxc3 17. Bxc3 Ngxe3 18. Rd2

15. h3 Nf6 16. Kh2 e5 {An interesting moment, structurally. How should White
react?} 17. Qf2 {brought Black into the game, even if just briefly...} ({
The somewhat counter intuitive} 17. e4 {which gives the d4-square and blocks
the g2-bishop, works wonders:} exf4 18. Bxf4 $1 Be6 19. Nf3 Rd8 20. e5 Nh5 21.
Ng5 $16 {White's pieces are too active.}) 17... e4 $1 {If White didn't play it,
Black didn't miss the chance.} 18. Qe2 h5 {But I missed everything since this
moment on, which is why the remainder of the game is no longer valuable.} (
18... Qe8 $1 $132) 19. Rad1 Re8 20. Nb5 {came as a surprise, which says enough,
unfortunately.} Re7 21. Bc3 Qf8 22. Qb2 Ne8 23. f5 {The game continued for
quite some time, to the surprise of both players, but objectively speaking,
White didn't miss anything major.} 1-0
