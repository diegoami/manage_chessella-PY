Bxh2 $2 {why Fischer captured this poisoned pawn has remained a mystery to
this day. The bishop endgame is completely drawn and now there are two results
a draw or a win for White. He must have miscalculated a line, which is a very
rare occurance in his games.} 30. g3 h5 31. Ke2 h4 32. Kf3 Ke7 {probably

{Timely counterplay is also important in the following very deep duel:[#]Black
can draw despite White's two extra pawns, but this might be the drawn endgame,
where the most false winning proves have been published in the history of
chess so far. The comparison with Fermat's Last Theorem in mathematics does
not fit completely as this really does hold and only the old proofs were false
until Andrew Wiles solved the riddle in 1995. I had also contributed one false
winning proof in Endgame Corner 43 and corrected it in Endgame Corner 55 (see
The ChessCafe Archives):} 66... Bb7 $2 {Now Black is indeed lost.} ({The
