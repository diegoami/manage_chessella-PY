c5 9. a3 Bxc3+ 10. bxc3 cxd4 11. cxd4 Qa5+ 12. c3 {This position has been
reached 17 times before. Now Mulet comes up with a move that had been played
only three times.} Bd7 13. f3 Bb5 $5 {All of this was being played at great
speed. Black was clearly in his preparation.} 14. fxe4 Bxe2 15. Bxe2 $1 {
The first new move of the game and the most challenging one. White is ready to
sacrifice his rook in order to gain time in development. In all other three
games White players had tried to defend c3 with their queen which led to an
equal position.} (15. Qg3 Bxf1 16. Rxf1 dxe4 $11) 15... Qxc3+ 16. Kf2 Qxa1 17.
exd5 Qa2 $1 {When I was looking at the game I wasn't sure where White's
compensation lies here. The d5 pawn has to move. Once it advances or takes on
e6, the knight can develop to c6, so I was confused. But Mihok showed that
White need not hurry. He has long term compensation.} 18. dxe6 $1 Qxe6 19. Qf3
{Keeping the queens.} Nd7 20. Qxb7 Rb8 (20... O-O 21. Bxh6 $14) 21. Qxa7 Qf5+ (

{Quite a tough variation, but in general you get to know that Black has to
play actively.}) 22... Qf5+ $1 {And now Bf3 is impossible because of the rook
coming down to b2.}) 22. Bf3 g5 23. h3 h5 $2 {The crucial mistake of the game.}
24. Qc7 O-O 25. g4 $1 $16 {After this move it became clear to me that White is
better. There were more ups and downs in store. But I liked the complex
opening and the imbalanced position that arose from it.} Qe6 26. Qc2 f5 27.
