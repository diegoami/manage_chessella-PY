Nf3 e6 3. g3 b5 $5 {Adly usually plays the King's Indian Attack. His 1.d4
opening, is met with some unconventional chess by Abdusattorov to take his
opponent into uncharted territory. b5 is well known in general, but Adly might
not have anticipated in his preparation.} 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. a4 b4 6. c4 bxc3 (6...
c5 {is the other main move in the position.}) 7. Nxc3 a5 $5 {Fixing the b4
square weakness.} 8. O-O Na6 9. Bf4 Be7 10. Qb1 {Quite an odd plan. Adly wants
to play e4 and that's the reason why he puts his queen on b1.} (10. Re1 $5 Ne4
11. Ne5 $14) 10... d5 (10... O-O 11. e4 d5 12. e5 Nd7 {followed by c5 gives
Black decent play.}) 11. Ne5 O-O 12. Rc1 c6 (12... c5 {is possible, but
Nodirbek didn't want to give up the b5 square.} 13. dxc5 Nxc5 14. Nb5 $13) 13.
e4 Qb6 14. Be3 Nb4 15. g4 {Adly likes to go for creative ideas, but here he is
pushing it a bit too far especially because the centre is quite fluid.} Qd8 $1
{This retreat makes is possible for the knight to go to d7 if attacked by the
pawn to g5.} 16. g5 Nd7 17. Nf3 Ba6 18. Rd1 Rb8 {Improving all his pieces.} 19.
h4 Kh8 20. Rd2 f5 $1 {A very strong move. White cannot close the position with
e5 because f4 would trap the bishop. This means that some lines will have to
be opened up and Black is just better prepared for that open position as you
shall see in the game.} (20... dxe4 21. Nxe4 Nd5 {also looks like a completely
legitimate way for Black to play.}) 21. exf5 (21. e5 f4 $19) (21. exd5 f4 $19)
21... Rxf5 {Black's major pieces down the f-file are going to create a havoc.}
22. Ne2 Qf8 23. Nh2 Bd6 24. Ng3 Bxg3 25. fxg3 Qd6 26. Bf2 (26. Bf4 Rxf4 27.
gxf4 Qxf4 {was Black's idea.} 28. Qd1 Qe3+ 29. Kh1 Nd3 $44 {Black has
excellent compensation.}) 26... Rbf8 27. Ra3 e5 28. Bh3 R5f7 29. g6 hxg6 30.
Bxd7 Qxd7 31. dxe5 (31. Qxg6 e4 $17) 31... Rf5 32. Bc5 Re8 $6 {Quite a bad
move by Nodirbek allowing the white knight to join the game with Nf3.} (32...
R8f7 $1 $17) 33. Nf3 $1 $16 Bc4 {Black's idea is to play Na6 and dislodge the
bishop from c5 and this is exactly what Adly misses.} 34. Re3 $2 (34. Rc3 Na6
35. Bf2 $16) 34... Na6 $1 35. Bd6 (35. Ba3 {The bishop moving away from the
crucial diagonal will spell White's doom.} Qa7 $1 36. Nd4 Rf1+ $19) 35... Qa7
$1 {The rook is pinned. Suddenly the position has become quite grim for White.}
36. Nd4 (36. Kf2 d4 37. Re4 Bd5 38. Rexd4 Rxf3+ $19) 36... Rf1+ 37. Qxf1 Bxf1
38. Kxf1 Nc5 {This is a techincal task now that Abdusattorov finishes off with
perfection.} 39. Nxc6 Qa6+ 40. Kg1 Ne4 41. Rxe4 dxe4 42. Nd4 e3 43. Rg2 Rc8 44.
Nb5 Rc1+ 45. Kh2 Qc6 46. Nc3 Rf1 {Not the most flawless of games that you will
see, but the 14-year-old played fine chess to put Adly Ahmed under tremendous
pressure. At the same time the Egyptian GM played a little bit too creatively
and that spelled his doom.} 0-1
