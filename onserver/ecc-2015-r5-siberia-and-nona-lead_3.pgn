up but as we already know when it is an opposite coloured bishop middlegame
initiative is more important than material. And in this position Ivanchuk has a
clear initiative. You might think it to be exaggerated, but it is true that
with accurate play, Black should be winning here.} Rb8 26. b3 Qc5 (26... Qa5 $1

no longer a one way traffic.} Qd6 34. Qf5 Rxg2 35. Qh7+ Kf8 36. Bg6 $2 { Leko
tries this desperate sacrifice thinking that he would have enough for an entire
rook. In a practical game, especially when you are low on time, picking up this
bishop looks extremely dangerous. But objectively fxg6 is a winning move.} Rb7

at his disposal.} (36... fxg6 $1 37. hxg6 {This might have been Leko's idea.
