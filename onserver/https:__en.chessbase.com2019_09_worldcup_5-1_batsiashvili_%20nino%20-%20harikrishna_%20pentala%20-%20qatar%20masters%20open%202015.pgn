{The hero of round one, Nino Batsiashvili, who drew Magnus Carlsen, faced
another stiff challenge in the form of Pentala Harikrishna today.} 1. d4 Nc6 $5
{Harikrishna decides to avoid well known paths and instead go for original
play.} 2. c4 e5 3. d5 Nce7 4. Nc3 Ng6 5. a3 (5. g3 {dominating the knight on
g6 could have been a much more useful move than a3.}) 5... f5 6. e4 fxe4 7.
Nxe4 Nf6 8. Bg5 d6 9. Bd3 Be7 10. Bxf6 (10. Bd2 $1 $14) 10... gxf6 {Of course
Harikrishna recaptures the bishop with the pawn. The knight on e4 no longer
feels so secure.} (10... Bxf6 11. Ne2 $14 {followed by Ng3 or Nc3 is a risk
free edge for White who has complete control of the e4 square.}) 11. Ng3 Nf4
12. Bf5 $2 {After this it all goes downhill for White.} (12. Be4 $1 {This
strong move would have allowed White to gain a substantial edge. What is the
reason for the same? First of all White threatens N1e2 to evict the knight
from f4. So Black has to be quick and must do something immediately but what
is it that he can do?} f5 (12... h5 $5 13. N1e2 h4 14. Nxf4 hxg3 15. Ng6 gxf2+
(15... Rxh2 16. Rxh2 gxh2 17. Qh5 $18) 16. Kxf2 $16) (12... O-O $5 {This is
what Hari had planned. However, White now has the counterintuitive move} 13.
Nf5 $1 Bxf5 14. Bxf5 Nxg2+ 15. Kf1 Nf4 16. Ne2 $1 $16 {With a firm grip on the
light squares White is clearly better.}) 13. Nxf5 $1 Nxg2+ 14. Kf1 Nf4 15. Ne2
$1 $14 {is a clear edge for White.}) 12... Bxf5 $1 13. Nxf5 Qd7 14. Nxe7 $2 (
14. g4 {was relatively better.}) 14... Nxg2+ $1 15. Kf1 Nf4 $1 {The knight on
e7 is not running away anywhere. Black is clearly better.} 16. Rc1 Kxe7 $1 {
Connecting the rooks.} 17. Rc3 Rag8 18. Ne2 Nxe2 19. Qxe2 h5 20. Ke1 Qf5 21.
Kd2 Rg4 22. Kc1 Rhg8 23. Rf1 b6 24. h3 Rf4 25. Qe3 Rg2 26. Rc2 Rf3 27. Qh6 Qg5+
{Nino resigned as she will lose the h3 pawn as well and will be two pawns down.
Not such a great game for the Georgian player after a wonderful first round
result.} 0-1
