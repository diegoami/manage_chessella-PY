1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 O-O 6. e3 b6 {We have already
seen enough of ...c5 in recent months to satisfy the most exacting taste, and .
..Nbd7 is currently (unfairly) seen as too passive after White's c5.} 7. cxd5 (
7. Bd3 dxc4 (7... Bb7 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. Nxd5 Bxd5 10. Qc2 $14 {seems to be
something.}) 8. Bxc4 Bb7 9. O-O Nbd7 10. Qe2 Nh5 11. Be5 a6 $11) (7. Rc1 Bb7 8.
Be2 {and now equality seems to be provided by the sequence} c5 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10.
cxd5 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Bxd5 12. a3 a5 13. O-O Nd7 {but this would be where I'd
look for some kind of nibble for White.}) 7... Nxd5 8. Nxd5 Qxd5 9. Be2 ({
Possibly, the most testing move could be the unassuming} 9. a3 $5 c5 (9... Ba6
10. Bxa6 Qa5+ (10... Nxa6 11. b4) 11. Ke2 Qxa6+ 12. Qd3 Qb7 13. b4 $132) 10.
dxc5 Qxc5 11. Rc1 Qa5+ 12. Qd2 $36 {Black has some trouble developing his
queenside in a normal way.}) 9... Qa5+ {White wants to play Nd2 anyway, so
it's a reasonable idea to get the queen off the long diagonal.} (9... Bb4+ $5
10. Nd2 Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 Qxg2 12. O-O-O Qd5 13. Kb1 Ba6 {Black should be
basically fine in this position.}) (9... Bd6 $2 10. Nd2 $1 $16) (9... Bb7 10.
Bxc7 Qa5+ 11. Kf1 Nd7 $14 {Black's compensation is of debatable value.}) 10.
Nd2 Ba6 11. O-O (11. Bxc7 $2 Bxe2 12. Qxe2 Rc8 $15 {is a very unhealthy pawn
to grab}) 11... c5 12. Nc4 {As we saw in Grischuk-Topalov in these pages a few
weeks ago, the Russian grandmaster likes his bishop-pair. But like almost
every other try in this 6...b6 line, there is no advantage.} (12. Bf3 Bxf1 13.
Bxa8 Bd3 $1 {achieves nothing.}) 12... Bxc4 13. Bxc4 cxd4 14. exd4 (14. Qxd4
Bf6 15. Qe4 {Otherwise the b2-pawn is basically free; there is no way to keep
the b8-knight contained at home either. Now Black can play for instance the
rather unaesthetic} Na6 16. Rab1 Rad8 $11 {with ideas like ...Rd2 coming up.})
14... Nc6 15. d5 {White must play this now, even as a pawn sacrifice, before
Black gets the chance to play something like ...Rad8, ...Qf5 or ...Bf6/...Ne7.}
exd5 ({Interestingly,} 15... Rad8 {might net the same pawn for free, but
Black's position is now suspect after} 16. Rc1 exd5 17. Be2 $14) 16. Qxd5 Qxd5
17. Bxd5 Rac8 {The commentators gave this position as +/=, however it seems
this evaluation is only necessarily true in case all the rooks come off- and
White has no way to force the same.} 18. Rad1 {On some subtle level this is
the 'wrong rook'- White needs to contest the c-file, and maybe also use f1 for
his king.} (18. Rfd1 Bf6 19. Rac1 Nd4 20. Kf1 h5 {Perhaps in theory, White
should press, but in practice it is nearly impossible to dislodge the
d4-knight despite its lack of pawn support. Also of note is the fact that in
some positions Black can go ...a5 and ...Ne6-c5. Still, this was the best way
to try.}) 18... Rfd8 19. g3 Bf6 20. Kg2 h5 (20... Nd4 {is possible immediately,
either getting a rook to the seventh or forcing through some trick like} 21.
Be4 Ne2 $1 $11) 21. b3 g5 22. Be3 (22. Bxc6 {does not lead to any tricks
relating to the f7-pawn, despite expectations:} gxf4 23. Bf3 (23. Bd5 Rc2 $1
$11) 23... fxg3 24. fxg3 h4 25. gxh4 Rxd1 26. Rxd1 Rc2+ 27. Kh3 Rxa2 28. Rd7

Bxd8 25. Rd1 Bf6 26. Bf3 g4 27. Be2 Nxa2 28. Bf4 Rc2 {It is arguable that
Black could have played on for some moves, at least until White found a way to
enter a rook and opposite-colour bishop ending with equal pawns, but he
decided not to.} 1/2-1/2
