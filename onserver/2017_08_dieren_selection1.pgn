{After a double-edged opening and middlegame discussion, the players landed in
the following position, which is far from lacking venom.} 22... Bf8 23. Qh5 {
sacrificing a piece for initiative} ({If} 23. Bxf8 Nxf8 {[%csl Rg5] and the
knight on g5 won't be satisfied with moves like h6 coming in sight.}) 23...
Bxh6 24. Nxh7 Kf7 25. Bxf5 {Now the second piece goes! It is quite exciting to
follow the Dutch chess scenes.} exf5 26. e6+ Kg7 27. e7 {Now food for thought:
can Black defend? How?} Kxh7 {was played but that loses on the spot.} ({
What else though?} 27... Rge6 {would not save much.} 28. e8=N+ {Just because
it looks prettier, obviously queening is not wrong either.} Rxe8 29. Qxe8 Kxh7
30. Re7+ Bg7 31. Qh5+ Rh6 32. Qxf5+ Kh8 33. Qf7 Bf8 34. Qxf8+ Nxf8 35. Rxc7 Be6
36. Rxc5 $18 {And White has too many pawns for Black to worry about.}) ({
Instead,} 27... Rbe6 $1 {would have kept the game going. That only if you saw
a crucial move further on...} 28. e8=Q Rxe8 29. Rxe8 Ne5 $1 {Analyze this!
Very difficult resource to be seen from afar.} (29... Kxh7 {runs into the same
devastating attack} 30. Re7+ Rg7 31. Qxf5+ Kh8 32. Rae1 $18) {The point is
that after} 30. fxe5 (30. Rxe5 $2 Bxf4 $19) 30... Be3+ 31. Kh1 Rh6 {would
follow, with a winning position for Black. White is, of course, not forced to
take the Trojan horse but at the end of the day, it will remain difficult to
keep an eye on all the weaknesses. That and my engine also prefers Black.}) 28.
e8=Q Rbf6 29. Qxh6+ {the cherry on the cake.} 1-0

{Another example from the same book entitled "Stepping on a minefield". The
fact that Vyacheslav Ikonnikov escaped with a draw is remarkable.} 1. d4 Nf6 2.

Now the question is: where to?} Kd8 {not the best square available} (13... Ke7
{first and only after} 14. Bd6+ Kd8 {would have kept all the chances on the
table} 15. Nxa8 Bxa8 {with a complicated and still fighting game.}) 14. Qd2 {
intermediate move which was most probably missed by Black} Qc6 15. Bxf6+ Kxc7
16. Bxh8 Bd6 17. Bc3 Re8 18. e3 $18 {However, the big advantage White had
vanished in the remainder of the game and Black got away with half a point.}
