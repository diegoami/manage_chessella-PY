1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Be7 7. Nc3 d5 { The
great thing about these players is that they are able to handle a system from
both sides. For example Karjakin played this same position from the white side
against Nakamura yesterday and today against Giri he is ready to try it with
black.} 8. cxd5 exd5 9. Bg2 O-O 10. O-O Re8 11. Ne5 Bb7 12. Bc1 Nbd7 13. Bb2
Bd6 14. Nd3 (14. f4 {is the normal way to play such positions but as Anish said
in the press conference, he didn't really want to go into this structure
because Black's way to respond here is quite typical and well known. On the
other hand, after retreating the knight to d3 it is not so obvious what the
best way for Black is to proceed, and it can present more practical problems.})
14... a5 {Karjakin was a little bit worried about White going b4 and hence
prevented it with this move.} 15. Rc1 c6 $5 {[%csl Ga5,Gb6,Gc6,Gd5] This
structure of a5-b6-c6-d5 is not very common in this opening, but the way
Karjakin played this game may make it quite popular in future.} 16. Na4 Rc8 17.
e3 Ba6 18. Re1 h5 $6 {This was an over-ambitious move and resulted in Giri
snatching the initiative.} (18... Ne4 {is much better. The point is that f3 can
be met with Nxg3 sacrifice.} 19. f3 Nxg3 $1 20. hxg3 Bxg3 $40 {With Qh4 coming
up this looks like a slow but very strong attack. As Giri said later, "if I
would have allowed this and Sergey would have won the game with the knight
sacrifice on g3, after he had beaten Nakamura yesterday when the latter
incorrectly sacrificed his knight on g3, it would have made him a genius."})
19. Bh3 $1 Ng4 $5 (19... h4 20. Ne5 $1 $14) 20. Nf4 {Anish thought that Black
was forced to take on f4, which would give him a fine position. It turns out
that Sergey was ready to give up a pawn rather than settle for a passive
position.} (20. f3 $5 {[#] was the critical move of the game. The computers at
first are highly enthusiastic about White's chances, but later they spot a very
nice resource for Black.} Rxe3 $5 {This move is something that should be
considered before we draw conclusions about the move f3.} (20... Nxe3 21. Qd2
Bxd3 22. Bxd7 $1 (22. Qxd3 Qg5 $11) 22... Qxd7 23. Qxd3 $14 {With e3 falling
and also b6 this is a very strong position for White.}) 21. Rxe3 Nxe3 22. Qd2
Bxd3 23. Qxd3 (23. Bxd7 Qxd7 24. Nxb6 (24. Qxd3 Re8 $15) 24... Qh3 25. Qxe3
Bxg3 $40) 23... Qg5 24. Kh1 $1 (24. Bxd7 Bxg3 $1) 24... Rd8 25. f4 {when the
complications end in White's favour. Although truth be told over here too Bxf4
will lead to some unclear play. But in any case this was all not so easy to
calculate over the board and hence Anish understandably decided to take the
other way.}) 20... g6 21. Bxg4 hxg4 22. Qxg4 {White is a pawn up, but his
pieces on the queenside, the bishop on b2 and the knight on a4 look completely
passive and hence Karjakin has compensation.} Nf6 23. Qg5 Be7 $1 {At first the
knight sacrifice on g6 looks tempting, but on closer inspection it seems like
its just a draw.} (23... Kg7 24. h4 Rh8 25. e4 $1 {was a nice variation pointed
out by Anish.} Nxe4 26. Rxe4 dxe4 27. d5+ $18) 24. Nxg6 fxg6 25. Qxg6+ Kh8
(25... Kf8 $2 26. e4 $1 dxe4 27. Nxb6 $18) 26. Nc5 (26. e4 {was a possibility
for Anish.} Bb4 $1 (26... dxe4 27. Nxb6 $1 Qxb6 28. Rc5 $1 $18) 27. Re3 Bd2 $11
{and this also ends in a draw. But it must be said that it looks pretty scary
for Black.}) 26... bxc5 27. dxc5 Rf8 28. Qh6+ (28. Rc4 $5 { would have been a
way to show off before making a draw!} dxc4 29. Qh6+ $11) 28... Kg8 29. Qg6+
{Seeing nothing better Anish agreed to a draw. It was a short game but with a
lot of interesting moments.} 1/2-1/2
