{If you are an avid chess fan, following everything that appears in social
media, then you might remember this incredible resource that Black had! And if
you are not in the know, try to find the way to victory - Black to move.} 40...
Rc6 {was played, which is indeed a sensible move, particularly in time trouble,
but the Peruvian GM missed an amazing continuation.} (40... Rc7 $3 {at first
glance} 41. a7 {looks not only scary but just wining for White; or...?} Nc6 42.

defended ferociously...two players that refuse to use the "draw" word in their
vocabulary, going all in whenever they can.} Rc7 44. Ke1 Rc6 45. a5 Ra6 46. Rb5

when humans overpower the computers, yes!! Defending a difficult position is
not a piece of cake and being precise in the critical moments is of vital
importance: can you find a way out for Black?} Ne8 $1 {I don't know if you
have the same but I get a great feeling when the engines are hopeless in
certain positions:) This is one of them, although, I have to admit, if you
leave them run for just a bit longer, they will switch to the right evaluation
- the pawn endgame is draw!} 65. Nxe8 Kxe8 66. Ke3 Ke7 67. Kf4 {Optically, it
looks completely winning for White but Black squeezed a draw with perfect play.
