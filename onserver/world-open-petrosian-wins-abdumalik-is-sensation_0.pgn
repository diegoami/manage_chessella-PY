{By winning this game, GM Petrosian secured a sweet payday for himself: clear
first place and US$20,500. His tournament path wasn't smooth, though. After
losing to GM Jeffery Xiong in round 6, Tigran had to pull off a streak of three
consecutive wins, which he did to his credit. A remarkable achievement!} 1. Nf3

popular}) 5. Ne5 Be6 6. O-O Nbd7 7. cxd5 Bxd5 8. Nf3 c5 9. Nc3 Bc6 10. Re1 a6
$2 {Looks unnecessary, and clearly doesn't accomplish much.} (10... e5 11. d3
Be7 { and Black is in the endgame, even though I like White slightly better
here.}) 11. e4 ({Tigran misses his chance. Two modest-looking pawn moves
would've given him a considerable advantage.} 11. d3 $1 e5 (11... e6 12. e4 Be7
13. d4 $16) 12. e3 $1 {with an idea to break Oliver's center after d3-d4 on the
next move. If I had Black here, I would've started thinking about how to
console myself after the game.}) 11... e5 12. d3 Be7 13. a4 b5 $2 {Yet another
mistake. In retrospect, I can easily suggest castling here.} (13... O-O 14. a5
Re8 {and Black is worse, obviously, but capable of defending the position.})
14. Nh4 g6 15. Bh6 $1 {A fine move. The king on e8 won't see the sunlight ever
since.} b4 $2 {Extending an invitation for White to come mate the Black's
king.} (15... Bf8) 16. Nd5 $1 Bf8 17. Qd2 Ng4 18. Bxf8 Nxf8 (18... Kxf8 {and,
at least, the king is safer, and the game isn't lost yet.}) 19. d4 $3 {A
study-like idea, which basically finishes the game. Black's pieces are just too
uncoordinated, and the king isn't good either.} cxd4 (19... exd4 20. Qf4 h5 21.

Qxe7+ $6 { Prolongs the game significantly, but still doesn't change the
evaluation: white is winning.} (25. d6 Qd8 26. Bd5 {was faster since besides
the extra material and domiantion, white attack the king as well.}) 25... Kxe7
