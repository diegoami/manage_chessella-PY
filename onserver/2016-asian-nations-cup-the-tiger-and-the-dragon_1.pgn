1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. Nc3 {White's somewhat cunning move
order has stopped Vidit from playing his favourite Grunfeld Defence. But as we
have seen recently, this young guy doesn't mind to experiment. King's Indian it
is!} d6 6. e3 $5 {This is quite an odd line in the fianchetto variation of the
King's Indian. Most of the times the knight goes to f3. However, Kazhgaleyev
tries to play something off beat to trick his opponent.} e5 { Why not!} 7. Nge2
Nbd7 8. O-O Re8 9. h3 c6 10. Qc2 exd4 $5 11. Nxd4 (11. exd4 { looks more
natural but it gives Black some valuable tempi to complete the development.}
Nb6 12. b3 Bf5 13. Qd1 Ne4 $1 14. g4 Nxc3 15. Nxc3 Be6 $11 { Followed by d5
next move and Black shouldn't be worse.}) 11... Nb6 12. b3 c5 $1 {Very alert.
The weakness on the h8-a1 diagonal will be exploited by Vidit.} 13. Nde2 Bf5 $1
(13... d5 14. cxd5 Nfxd5 15. Rd1 {causes some grief to Black.}) 14. Qd1 (14. e4
$2 Nxe4 $1 $17) 14... d5 $1 15. Ba3 (15. cxd5 Nfxd5 16. Bb2 Nb4 {And it seems
like Black has the initiative. Although truth be told this position is
somewhere around even. This was the best option for White.}) 15... dxc4 $1 16.
Qxd8 Raxd8 17. Bxc5 Ne4 18. Bxe4 Bxe4 19. Bd4 (19. Nxe4 Bxa1 20. Nd6 $1 Rxd6
21. Bxd6 Bb2 22. bxc4 Nxc4 {is round about even but wasn't so easy to calculate
for White.}) 19... Bd3 20. Bxg7 Kxg7 21. Rfc1 g5 $5 {One could say that this
move can be made either by a very strong player or a complete amateur. Why
exactly did Black push his g-pawn at a moment when there could have been other
pressing matters to attend to? Well there isn't much to do and hence Vidit
limits the scope of the e2 knight to some extent and also gains space on the
kingside.} 22. Nd4 h5 23. Rd1 Bg6 24. Rac1 {White has been playing quite
logically and the position is round about equal.} a6 25. bxc4 Nxc4 26. Na4 b5
27. Nc5 Rd6 28. Rc3 g4 29. h4 Kf6 30. Rdc1 Ne5 31. Ra3 Ra8 $6 ( 31... Kg7 32.
Rxa6 Rxa6 33. Nxa6 Ra8 $11) 32. Nxb5 $1 {White has won a pawn.} Nf3+ 33. Kg2
Rd2 {Black has some activity but with accurate play things can be kept under
control by White.} 34. Nc3 Kg7 35. Rxa6 Rc8 $5 {A practical decision by the
Indian player. He attacks the c5 knight and White has only one way to keep his
edge.} 36. Nb3 $2 (36. Ra5 $1 {This keep control and Black is struggling to
prove his compensation.}) 36... Rd3 $1 37. Ne2 Rxc1 38. Nbxc1 Rd1 {Suddenly the
bishop is coming to e4 and a mating net is getting formed around the White
king.} 39. Ra4 Ne1+ 40. Kh2 Nf3+ 41. Kg2 Bf5 (41... Nd2 $1 {is an excellent
move. It prepares Be4+ which cannot be stopped.} 42. Nb3 Be4+ 43. Rxe4 Nxe4
$17) 42. e4 Bd7 43. Ra6 Bb5 44. Rb6 Bc4 45. Rc6 Bb5 46. Rb6 Bc4 47. Rc6 Ne5 $5
{A bold decision by Vidit to continue the game but absolutely correct as the
White pieces are completely tied down.} 48. Rc5 Kf6 49. a4 Re1 { The knight
cannot move as c1 hangs.} 50. Rxc4 Nxc4 51. f3 gxf3+ 52. Kxf3 Rf1+ 53. Kg2 Ne3+
54. Kh2 Ke5 55. a5 Kxe4 56. a6 Rf6 57. Nc3+ Kf3 58. a7 Ra6 59. N1e2 Rxa7 60.
Kh3 Ng4 61. Nd4+ Kf2 62. Nd1+ Kg1 63. Ne2+ Kh1 $1 {This is aesthetically
beautiful!} 64. Nf4 Ra2 {A very interesting battle where we could see how the
superfluous knights are completely useless defending each other. Vidit made
full use of that factor.} 0-1
