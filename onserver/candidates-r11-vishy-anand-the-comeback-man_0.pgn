1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {After his exploits with the Guioco Piano Anand is
back to his Ruy Lopez, not fearing the Anti-Berlin.} Nf6 4. d3 Bc5 5. c3 O-O 6.
O-O d6 7. h3 {As Samuel Shankland explained in his annotations, this move is a
little bit slow because now Black can go back to e7 with his knight, rerouting
it to g6, and he is not afraid of d3-d4 because the e4 pawn hangs. Hence Re1 is
the main move here. But Anand played 7.h3 against Caruana and now tries it over
here again, so he doesn't really agree with the opening assessment and instead
is trying to blaze new paths.} Ne7 8. d4 Bb6 9. Bd3 d5 (9... Ng6 { was played
by Fabiano and after Qc2 it lead to a complex battle. Sergey goes for the more
combative approach.}) 10. Nxe5 $146 {[%cal Gf3e5] This is the first new move of
the game. It was prepared by Grzegorz Gajewski who saw the dangers and
difficulties that lie for Black in this relatively sedate line.} ( 10. Nbd2
{was played by Magnus Carlsen against Vladimir Kramnik.}) (10. dxe5 { was
played by Ivanchuk against Karjakin in 2012.}) 10... Nxe4 (10... dxe4 11. Bc2)
11. Nd2 Nd6 {The knight is well placed on d6.} 12. Nb3 c6 {Karjakin thought for
a long time for this move.} (12... Bf5 {was also possible and looks like the
most natural way to continue.} 13. Bf4 Bxd3 14. Nxd3 $14 { White has a small
edge.}) 13. Nc5 $5 {A very interesting move made quickly by Anand. It puts
pressure on the b7 pawn, and to get rid of that pressure Black must give up one
of his bishops.} Ng6 14. Qh5 Bxc5 {A decision which cannot have been made with
a light heart. The knights were irritating and Sergey thought it was a good
deal to give up his dark squared bishop.} 15. dxc5 Ne4 16. Bxe4 (16. b4 $6 Re8
$1 $15 (16... Nxc3 17. Bb2 $13)) (16. Be3 {is also possible but after} Re8 17.
Nxg6 hxg6 18. Qd1 Qe7 {Black should be fine.}) 16... dxe4 17. Rd1 Qe7 18. Nxg6
{Anand is in some sort of a must win scenario. To play this move shows great
objectivity. Of course the position is round about equal, but with the control
of the d-file White has something to play for.} (18. Nc4 {would be ideal but it
met with} f5 19. Nd6 b6 $1 $11 { immediately breaking the queenside structure.
Black is completely fine here.} ( 19... Be6 20. Bg5 $14)) 18... hxg6 19. Qg5
{[%cal Gh5g5] When Vishy played this move many people thought that the players
would make a quick draw and get back home early for a dinner. But instead the
game went on for another 50 moves!} Qxg5 20. Bxg5 {White's advantage lies in
the fact that he controls the d-file. Black on the other hand is a tad passive
and the e4 pawn will act as a hindrance for his bishop.} f6 (20... Be6 21. Rd4
f6 22. Bf4 f5 23. Rd6 Kf7 24. Rad1 $14 {is a much better version for White than
what happened in the game.}) 21. Be3 {White has the d-file but that is where
his advantages end. It is really surprising that Anand could win such a
position against a defender like Sergey Karjakin!} g5 (21... Be6 22. Rd4 f5
{Provoking f5 helps to control the dark squares.} 23. Rd6 Kf7 24. Rad1 $14) 22.
Rd6 Re8 23. Rad1 Be6 24. b3 Kf7 25. R1d4 $1 Bf5 26. a4 $5 {Anand mixes up his
play. He keeps the move g4 in reserve and starts his queenside expansion.
Playing on both wings is bound to create some difficulties for the opponent.}
Re7 (26... Ke7 27. g4 Be6 28. Rxe4 $16) 27. g4 Bh7 28. b4 Bg8 (28... a5 $5
{could have been tried.} 29. b5 cxb5 30. axb5 a4 {and the a-pawn is pretty
strong.}) 29. b5 Rc8 30. Rd7 (30. Rb4 Ke8 31. bxc6 Rxc6 32. Rxc6 bxc6 33. Rb8+
Kf7 $11) 30... Rce8 (30... cxb5 31. Rxe7+ Kxe7 32. Rxe4+ Be6 33. axb5 $14) 31.
b6 $5 {A highly committal move but at the same time an excellent one. With the
pawn entrenched so deeply in enemy territory this is bound to create some
difficulties for the opponent.} a6 ( 31... axb6 32. cxb6 {gives White
additional options of creating a passer with a5-a6.}) 32. Rc7 Kf8 (32... Rxc7

Rxe4+ $14 {wins a pawn, and although it may not be sufficient to win, it is
something to play for.}) 33. c4 Be6 {Some might argue that it was not necessary
for Sergey to give up the e4 pawn. But the pawn was anyway weak and not worth
clinging on to. Meanwhile White could have just improved his king. So Karjakin
decides to give up the pawn and simplify the position.} 34. Rxe4 Kf7 (34...
Rxc7 35. bxc7 Ke7 $1 (35... Kf7 36. Bd2 $1 Rc8 37. Ba5 {is quite a nice
position for White to play!}) 36. f4 $14 ( 36. Bd2 $6 Kd7 $1 37. Ba5 Kc8 38.
Rd4 Bd7 $11) 36... gxf4 37. Bxf4 Kd7 38. Kf2 {Once again White's position is
preferable.}) 35. f4 $1 {Anand was on top of his game at this point and made
all the best move in the position.} Rxc7 36. bxc7 {[%cal Re8c8,Gf6f5]} Rc8 $6
{The important mistake of the game by Karjakin, and that too at a critical
juncture. He has less time and there are still four moves to be made until the
time control.} (36... gxf4 37. Bxf4 $16) (36... f5 $1 {was the strong move that
would have secured Karjakin the draw.} 37. Re5 (37. Rd4 Rc8 38. fxg5 Rxc7 $11)

task extremely difficult.} g6 (38... Rxc7 39. hxg5 fxg5 40. Rd4 $1 (40. Bxg5 $6
Bc8) 40... Be8 41. Bxg5 $16) (38... gxh4 39. Rd4 $1 {With the idea of Bf4.})

winning.}) 44. Kg2 Bd7 45. Bg5 $1 {A good decision by Anand, not committing the
move g4-g5 and not giving the f5 square for the bishop.} (45. g5 Bf5 {gives
Black good defensive chances.}) 45... Be6 46. Rd8+ Kf7 47. Rb8 Bxc4 (47... Bxg4

win here. The a6 pawn is also quite weak.} Ke6 54. Re8+ Kd7 55. Ra8 Ke6 56.

beautiful endgame by Anand! As Kasparov said, "Vishy was just in a different
league altogether in this game!"} 1-0
