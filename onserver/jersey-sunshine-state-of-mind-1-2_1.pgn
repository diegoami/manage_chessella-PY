{Since we just saw a rather unusual king march in the previous game, adding
another one to the collection cannot hurt.} 30. Bb5 $2 {Something went wrong
for White in the opening and middlegame but after the next move it is suddenly
all over!} (30. Bg3 {is more stubborn, with an inferior but certainly playable
position for White.}) 30... Qh5 $1 31. Bxe8 Rxe8 32. Bg3 Qf3+ 33. Kg1 Nxe3 34.
Nh3 Nc4 {and the b7-bishop turns from the 'ugly duck' into...not a swan but a
dragon!} 35. Qg2 Bxd4+ 36. Bf2+ Qxg2+ 37. Kxg2 e3+ 38. Kg3 Nd2 39. Be1 Nf1+ 40.
Kh4 Bf6+ 41. Kh5 Bf3+ 42. Kh6 Nxh2 43. Ng5 {Courtesy:) Allowing Black the
satisfaction of delivering checkmate. Great game played by Jovanka and a good
tournament over all, hadn't it been the last game against your author...} Bg7#
