Ne7  8. Re1  O-O  9. Be3  h6 {(01:07) While this might still be described as
theory per the databases, this setup of the Modern Defence is very flexible,
and unlikely to have been any specific preparation. The growing amount of time
spent by both players in the following moves corroborates this.} 10. h4  f5 $2
{(11:24) A pretty strange choice in view of the bishop on c4, now pressuring
the e6 pawn for free. Why not continue Black's development with Bb7, Nd7, or
even Nc6 as the engine seems to like?} 11. exf5  Nxf5  12. g3  Kh7  13. Bd3 
Kh8  14. Be4  d5  15. Bxf5  Rxf5  16. Ne5  Bxe5  17. dxe5  Qf8 {[#] (01:03)}
18. Nxd5 $1 {(07:36) What a lovely shot! White decides to take advantage of
Black's refusal to develop her pieces and strikes first. It must have come as a
great shock to the former World Women Champion.} exd5  19. Qxd5  Ra7  20. g4 
Bb7  21. Qe6 $6 {(06:59) An imprecision that could have cost the initiative,
but she will not be punished today.} Rf3  22. Qxg6  Rh3  23. f4 {(00:45) The
engines actually claim this is equal, but that huge pawnroller in front of
Black's king just looks like trouble. I know which side I would prefer to be
playing here.} Nc6  24. f5  Rxh4 {(00:23) The problem is that while it does
gain back a pawn, it is an unimportant one at the moment, and allows White to
gain precious tempi she will can put to good use.} 25. Kf2  Qg7 $4 { (03:06)
Black wants to alleviate the pressure she is under by exchanging the queens,
but overlooks the disastrous consequences.} (25... Ra8 {was preferable,
bringing the rook into play and to the king's defense.}) 26. Qxg7+  Kxg7  27.
