1. c4 c5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. e3 $5 {While Nf3 and Nc3 are the main moves in
this position, e3 is not very uncommon. White's idea is simple that he wants to
play an immediate d4 or Nge2 followed by d4 and for that he doesn't need to
develop his b1 knight.} e6 {Fabiano wants to keep the game in uncharted
territory. Nf6 and Nc6 are both more popular.} (4... Nf6 5. d4 (5. Ne2 O-O 6.
Nbc3 {might soon lead to a main line in the English.}) 5... cxd4 6. exd4 d5 {
looks great for Black.}) 5. d4 cxd4 6. exd4 Ne7 7. d5 $5 exd5 8. cxd5 d6 {
Interesting comments were made about this position by Miroshnichenko, Kosteniuk
and Gelfand. As Kosteniuk and Miro said, "It's a tradeoff between having more
space with the pawn on d5 and the open bishop on g7. What is more important? It
is not so easy to decide!" Boris had some other important points to make.
"Black would have been completely fine if the black knight would have been on
f6 instead of e7. As things stand right now, the f5 square is the best for both
the knight and the c8 bishop and that in some ways hinders Black's
development."} 9. Nc3 Nd7 10. Nf3 O-O 11. O-O h6 $5 {An intersting move
preventing ideas like Bg5 and getting ready to play g6-g5 at an appriopriate
moment.} 12. h4 $5 {White nips the g5 idea in the bud. But everything comes at
a cost. This move weakens the g4 square and the c8 bishop would like to reach
there soon.} Nc5 13. Re1 Bg4 {Now things look quite smooth for Fabi. The knight
is coming to f5 and the queen to f6 and the rooks to c8 and e8. Suddenly all
the co-ordination issues seem to have been solved, or have they?!} 14. Bf4 Nf5
15. Qd2 Bxf3 (15... Qf6 16. Nh2 {makes the bishop on g4 looks silly and hence
taking on f3 was the right choice.}) 16. Bxf3 Qf6 17. Rac1 { This move prepares
b4. After the knight on c5 is displaced, the c3 knight jumps to e4. Black might
have got his pieces co-ordinated but the bishop pair, combined with the space
always give the first player some better chances.} a5 18. Nb5 $1 {Nakamura is
never averse when it comes to tactical complications. He sees that exchanging
the b2 pawn for the guy on d6 would be a good deal.} Qxb2 19. Qxb2 Bxb2 20. Rc2
Bf6 21. Bxd6 (21. Nxd6 {looks natural but fails to} Nd4 $1 {The knight on b5
keeps this possibility under check.}) 21... Nxd6 22. Nxd6 (22. Rxc5 b6 23. Rc6
Nxb5 24. Rxf6 $14 {might also be a position to explore for White, especially
because Black cannot get his blockade on d6.}) 22... b6 23. Rb1 Rab8 24. Nc4
(24. h5 $5 {Throwing in this move at some point would have created an
additional tension in the position that would have been to White's advantage.
It is a Karpovian move whose benefits are not so apparent in the current
position. But later, when the rooks penetrate, the possibility of opening the
seventh rank with hxg6 fxg6 might play an important role.}) 24... Na4 25. Bg4
$6 {Black equalises after this inaccurate move.} (25. Ne3 Nc3 26. Rb3 Rfc8
{also looks pretty much fine for Black.}) (25. h5 $5) 25... Rfd8 $1 {Attacking
the d5 pawn.} 26. d6 h5 $1 27. Bh3 b5 28. Nxa5 Rxd6 $11 29. Nc6 Rb6 30. Nb4 Nc3
31. Rb3 {Nakamura had really got the pressure going in the position. But he
couldn't sustain it. One wrong move and Caruana was right back and made what
looked like an effortless draw.} 1/2-1/2
