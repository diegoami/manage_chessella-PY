suddenly...} 10... O-O-O $5 {"Oh mama mia! Does he wants to mate me? I lost
peace of mind. g7-g5 is coming! Ok, let's block it" - that what was I thinking

19. Bd3 {but prefed more complicated line}) 19... Rg6 (19... Re8 {look more
natural}) 20. Rae1 {The last piece coming into the battle. Here I calmed down
because with such active pieces white is out of any danger} g4 $2 {The first
and fatal mistake} ({Black needs to neutralize white's queen activity, that's
why they to play} 20... Qd8 {preparing Bb8. The position is still unclear}) 21.
