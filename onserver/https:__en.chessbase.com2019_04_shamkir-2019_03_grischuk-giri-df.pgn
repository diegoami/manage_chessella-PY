g4 $5 {This seems to be a novelty, the product of Grischuk's legendary
creativity. In view of the slightly favourable endings that may arise, this
could easily get tried again, and probably Black will find a reaction that
avoids them, such as ...Qd8.} cxd4 (10... Qd8 $5 11. h4 (11. Rg1 Nc6 12. g5 h5

precise defence. White is closer to landing a knockout blow, but his king is
also susceptible to perpetual checks, as we soon see.} (14... Nd7 15. Nxg5 Bb7

develops with ...Rac8-c3 or something, but this would have been very hard to
