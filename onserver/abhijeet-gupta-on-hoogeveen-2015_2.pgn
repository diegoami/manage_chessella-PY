gxf6 $2 13. Rc1 $18) 13. Bxg7 Rg8 14. Rc1 Qa6 15. Bh6 $16 {The position is
clearly in White's favour.}) 12. Rc1 Qa5 {This has been seen in many games and
Black is scoring pretty well. From the numerous options available here Vishnu
chooses the move Bb5+.} 13. Bb5+ Nd7 $2 (13... Ke7 $1 {is the main move played
by great players like Morozevich, Ivanchuk, Jakovenko, etc. Black is doing
pretty well in the position.}) {[#]} 14. Qb3 $6 {The players agreed to a draw
at this point, although it must be mentioned that Black has a pretty decent
position after 0-0. White simply missed a very strong continuation at his
disposal.} (14. Rxc8+ $3 {would have given White a nearly decisive advantage.}
Rxc8 15. Bxd7+ Ke7 (15... Kxd7 16. Nb3+ $18 {loses the queen.}) 16. Bxc8 Rxc8 {
Abhijeet thought that he had decent compensation here. While this is true for
humans because Black has an extra pawn, the a2 pawn is hanging and also the
rook on h1 will take time to come into the game. But for the silicon monster it
just takes a few seconds to determine that White is just winning after} 17. Ke2

for both sides.}) 1/2-1/2
