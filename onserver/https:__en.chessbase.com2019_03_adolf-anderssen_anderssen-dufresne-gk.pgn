{Today we will look at a game that bewitched its contemporaries and became
known as the "evergreen".} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5

13. Qa4 Bb6 14. Nbd2 Bb7 15. Ne4 Qf5 16. Bxd3 Qh5 {[#] White has a huge
advantage and it is time for decisive action. In accordance with his own
romantic style and public demand Anderssen played} 17. Nf6+ {?!! The two
exclamation marks are for one of the most beautiful combinations in chess
history, which was started with this move. But objectively the search for
beauty created unnecessary complications. The prosaic ?!!} (17. Ng3 Qh6 18. Bc1
Qe6 19. Bc4 Nd5 (19... Qg6 20. Nh4 Qg4 21. Bxf7+) 20. Ng5 Qg4 21. Re4 {would
finish the game without any troubles, but then chess would have lost one of
the jewels from its crown!}) 17... gxf6 18. exf6 Rg8 $1 {At first sight an
open g-file gives Black excellent counter-attacking chances, but Anderssen's
calculations were beyond the fears of an ordinary human being.} 19. Rad1 $1 {
I'll spare you hundreds of analyses by following generations of chess players.
After endless debate they have agreed that 19.Rad1 was better than the
alternative 19.Be4. Now the best reply was 19. ..Rg4!, which would pose some
difficult problems for White, but in the emerging wild complications White
would, in my opinion, retain the upper hand.} Qxf3 $2 {Now White's king is
suddenly just one step from decapitation. But how can we reproach Dufresne
from not recognising the magic of a genius? [#]} 20. Rxe7+ $1 Nxe7 $5 {Another
proof that chess masterpieces require the generous cooperation of the loser!
Nowadays a professional player and, of course, a computer, would have without
hesitation resorted to} (20... Kd8 {preventing the upcoming demolition, but
losing anyway later after} 21. Rxd7+ $1 Kc8 (21... Kxd7 22. Bf5+ Ke8 23. Bd7+

26. Qxd1 {with a boring but winning endgame.}) 21. Qxd7+ $3 Kxd7 22. Bf5+ Ke8
23. Bd7+ Kf8 24. Bxe7# {It was not surprising that chess players of the time,
impressed by this kind of greatness, did not want to listen to dull positional
advice. But the old combinational school, led by its first knight Anderssen,
was doomed in the battle against the modernized warfare techniques of Paul
Morphy, whose tactics had much better positional foundations.} 1-0
