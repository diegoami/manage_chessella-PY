seems more critical to me. Perhaps Nico was afraind of an improvement in the
following game} g6 12. Nf3 Re8 13. Ng5 Bc4 14. Re1 Nbd7 15. a4 Qc6 (15... Rac8

2018. White is a bit better here.}) 11... Rc8 12. Rfd1 b5 13. Rac1 $6 {Why
such prophylaxis? The position is one where White should be aiming for an
advantage, not passive equality.} (13. Rd2 $1 {was a better way of
overprotecting the pawn. Play can now go} b4 14. Nd5 Nxd5 15. exd5 Bg4 16. h3
Bh5 17. g4 $5 Bg6 18. a3 bxa3 19. Rxa3 $13 {and c2 is as much a potential
weakness as the a-pawn. This seems to be White's best try here.}) 13... Nbd7
14. Bg5 h6 15. Bxf6 Nxf6 16. Nd5 Nxd5 17. Bxd5 Bxd5 18. Rxd5 Qc4 $1 {The
problem with White's play is illustrated by this move. At this point the tide
has turned - White has to be precise to equalise.} 19. Qxc4 Rxc4 20. Nd2 Ra4
21. a3 Rc8 22. Kf1 Bg5 $5 {the start of an interesting idea from Sam.} 23. g3 (
23. c3 $1 {was the best way to neutralise Black's activity. Now the best seems
to be} Rd4 24. Rxd4 exd4 25. Ke2 dxc3 26. Rxc3 Rxc3 27. bxc3 $11 {with a
probably drawn endgame.}) 23... Rc6 24. c3 Rxe4 $1 {Enterprising. Sam doesn't
want to go for just a comfortable draw - he wants to win!} (24... a5 25. Ke2 b4
{was the safe way to play. Black is more than fine after} 26. axb4 axb4 27. c4
Ra2 28. Rc2 Bxd2 29. Rcxd2 Rxc4 $11 {but whether he can win this remains to be
seen - the answer is most probably no.}) 25. f4 Bxf4 26. gxf4 Rxf4+ 27. Kg2 f5

objective advantage. Now after} Kf7 31. Rxd6 Rxd6 32. Rxd6 f3 33. h3 Rg3 34.
Nc5 $1 $14 {I don't see enough compensation for the piece.}) 30... Rb6 31. c4
$5 {This concept is flawed at best. Black's f-pawn starts running now, and
White's king is not something to be proud about.} f3 32. c5 dxc5 33. Rxe5 Rg2
34. Rexc5 Re6 {Black has given up a pawn, but his two rooks start to
co-ordinate and White faces some serious problems.} 35. b4 Re4 {This is an
innacuracy. It is heartening to see Sam playing for a win, but one must
understand that the position is an equal one, so this move is objectively not
the best.} (35... Ree2 $1 36. Rh5 Kh7 37. Rh3 Rb2 38. Rxf3 Rxh2+ $11 {is an
easy draw, but Sam plays for more.}) 36. Rg1 (36. Rc8+ $1 Kf7 37. Rf1 $1 {
is how Nico should have played. After the forcing} Rf2 $1 38. Rcc1 Ree2 39.
Rxf2 Rxf2 40. Nc6 $14 {White gets his knight into play and can claim a slight
advantage.}) 36... Ra2 37. Rh5 $4 {This is rather unfortunate. After
conducting the entire game with a relatively high accuracy, Nico stumbles at
the end.} (37. Rc8+ $1 Kf7 38. Rc3 $11 {and the weakness on f3 means that
Black can't advance that easily.}) 37... f2 $1 38. Rf1 Ra1 $3 {A spectacular
finish to an interesting tussle.} 0-1
