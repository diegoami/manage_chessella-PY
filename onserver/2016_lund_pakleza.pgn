{When playing a game, is not always roses and unicorns and sometimes we must
survive those cliff-hanging episodes. So, which square is less mined for the
knight?} 20... Nh7 $2 {was not the escaping ticket due to} (20... Nd5 {is not
really working either in view of:} 21. Ne4 Rfd8 22. Nf6+ {with a crushing
attack.}) (20... Ne8 {is not completely a safe haven but definitely keeps
Black in the game as after} 21. Ne4 Bxe4 22. Bxe4 Rd8 23. Bc2 {Black can
simply ignore the upcoming battery on the b1-h7 diagonal with even} a5 {
quite provocative if you ask me but} 24. Qe4 {doesn't work since Black has the}
f5 {defence.}) 21. Nxh7 $1 Kxh7 22. Be4+ Kg8 23. b4 {and Black loses a bishop
after 23... Bxb4 24. Bxb7 Qxb7 25. Rxb4. Such an effective solution executed
elegantly by the bronze medalist.} 1-0

{In one game or another, all the GMs had or could have had troubles this event.
And if we talk about the Rapid games, chances are even higher. Here White
erred with:} 29. Nh4 (29. Rxg6 $1 {was the way to go since} hxg6 30. Ng5 Nf6
31. Bc4 {[%csl Rf7][%cal Gc4f7,Gf1f7,Gg5f7] gives White a massive pressure on
the vulnerable f7-pawn & a2-g8 diagonal. If Black stubbornly defends} Rd7 32.

Rf7,Rh7]}) 29... Bxe4 30. Qc4 Bd5 {and the game ended in Black's favour.} 0-1
