1. e4 e5 2. Nf3
Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O Nxe4 5. Re1 {Magnus goes for a pretty sedate line,
trying to get a small edge.} Nd6 6. Nxe5 Be7 7. Bf1 Nxe5 8. Rxe5 O-O 9.
Nc3 Ne8 10. Nd5 Bd6 11. Re1 c6 12. Ne3 Be7 13. c4 Nc7 14. d4 d5 15. cxd5
Nxd5 16. Nxd5 cxd5 17. Bf4 {All of this has been seen before in the game
Areshechenko-Bacrot in June 2015. White won that game. The position is
very symmetrical. However, White seems to have a small edge due to better
placement of his pieces, like the rook being on e1 and the bishop on f4.
However, this is nothing much.} Bf6 18. Be5 Bxe5 19. Rxe5 {One of the
reasons why White should have a small edge here is because the d5 pawn
is on a light square, which means that the bishop on c8 is slightly a
bad piece.} Re8 20. Rxe8+ Qxe8 21. Qb3 {Magnus was playing his moves pretty
quickly and confidently.} Qc6 22. Bb5 Qb6 {Black is ready to sacrifice
his d5 pawn in order to get some counterplay.} (22... Qd6 23. Rc1 (23.
Re1 Be6 $11) 23... Be6 {also looks fine. But Caruana wanted to be more
precise and hence chose Qb6 over Qd6.}) 23. Qxd5 a6 $1 {Very accurate.}
(23... Be6 24. Qc5 $1 Qxc5 25. dxc5 $16 {is just an extra pawn.}) 24.
Bd3 {Magnus retreats to a square where he can create some mating threats
with Bd3.} Be6 25. Qe4 g6 26. d5 {It seems as if White has things going
his way, but Caruana has everything under control.} Bf5 27. Qe2 Bxd3 28.
Qxd3 Qxb2 {Black recovers the pawn. However, the d5 pawn is not at all
a unit that should be underestimated.} 29. Re1 Rd8 30. d6 Rd7 {Stopping
the pawn in the tracks. This is not all easy to defend but Caruana does
a fine job.} (30... Qxa2 31. Qd4 $1 {looks pretty dangerous with Qf6 coming
up next.}) 31. g3 $5 {Magnus takes out time to secure his back rank.}
Qf6 32. Rd1 Qe5 33. Qa3 a5 34. f4 {This move might well be practically
strong, however in the end it was this move that led to the perpetual
check.} Qe2 35. Qc1 Qe6 36. Qc5 b5 37. Qxb5 (37. Qe5 $11 {Anand and Aronian
analyzed this move in their press conference and it is also equal.}) 37...
Rxd6 $1 {Caruana is tactically alert and sacrifices his rook in order
to get a perpetual check.} 38. Qb8+ Kg7 39. Qxd6 Qe3+ 40. Kg2 Qe2+ 41.
Kg1 Qe3+ 42. Kg2 Qe2+ 1/2-1/2
