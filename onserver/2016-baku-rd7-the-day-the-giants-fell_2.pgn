{Nepomniachtchi (Nepo from now on because I feel too lazy to write down the
whole name!) has been an instrumental figure in Russia's strong comeback to
table one. WIth seven in seven, you cannot ask for more than that!} 1. e4  c5 
2. Nf3  Nc6  3. d4  cxd4  4. Nxd4  Nf6  5. Nc3  e5 {(00:00) Hracek is a veteran
GM with years of experience at the highest level. He always plays 'healthy'
openings with a good grasp of middlegame nuances. His opening choice today is a
Sveshnikov!} 6. Ndb5  d6  7. Bg5  a6  8. Na3  b5  9. Nd5 {(00:05) The favorite
move of 12th world champion Anatoly Karpov.} (9. Bxf6 gxf6 {used to be the main
line but it is not so any more!}) 9... Be7  10. Bxf6  Bxf6  11. c4 {(00:08)
Nepo plays this against the Sveshnikov, exclusively.} b4  12. Nc2  O-O  13. g3 
Be6  14. h4  a5  15. Bh3  a4 {(03:31) Nepo himself had reached this position
back in 2009 against Ni Hua} 16. Qd3 $146 {(07:34) This move seems very natural
but it is a novelty! We may not be surprised to see a novelty on move 16 in a
Berlin, Spanish or even a French Defence, however, it is rare to see a novelty
in the Sveshnikov this early!} (16. b3 Bxd5 17. cxd5 Nd4 18. Nxd4 exd4 19. O-O
Re8 20. bxa4 Rxe4 21. Rc1 Re8 22. Rc4 d3 23. Qxd3 Rxa4 24. Rfc1 Ra3 25. Qc2 Bc3

Nepomniachtchi,I (2632)-Ni,H (2701) Sochi 2009}) 16... b3 $1 {(12:46) This is
why nobody plays Qd3. Nepo on the other hand has a different opinion.} 17. Nce3
$6 {(00:08) Very very dubious!} bxa2 $2 {(08:09) a weak reaction from Hracek.
He had to go "all in" in this position. It may not be something he likes but it
is what the position calls for.} (17... a3 $1 18. Qxb3 (18. axb3 axb2 19. Rb1
Bxh3 20. Rxh3 Ra1 21. Rh1 Qa5+ 22. Kf1 Rxb1+ 23. Qxb1 Qa3 24. Qd1 Rb8 25. Kg2
Bd8 $17) 18... Nd4 19. Qc3 Qd7 $1 {I think Hracek missed the power of this move
and that is why he did not enter this line.} 20. Nxf6+ gxf6 21. Bxe6 fxe6 22.
b3 (22. b4 Qb7) 22... Qb7 23. Qd3 f5 24. O-O fxe4 25. Qd1 Nf3+ 26. Kh1 Rad8
{and d5-d4 seems unstoppable.}) 18. Rxa2  Qa5+  19. Kf1  Bxd5  20. Nxd5  Nb4 
21. Nxb4  Qxb4  22. Bd7  Bd8 {(09:13) Both players are activating their
bishops.} 23. Bc6  Ra7  24. Qc2  a3 $2 {(03:06) This is a tactical blunder.
Hracek does not play active chess today.} (24... Bb6 25. Rxa4 Rxa4 26. Bxa4 Bd4
27. b3 f5 28. exf5 Qb7 29. Rh2 g6 30. g4 (30. h5) (30. fxg6 Bxf2 31. gxh7+ Kh8
{was very dangerous for White.}) 30... Qf3 31. Rg2 Kh8 32. b4 gxf5 33. gxf5 Rg8
34. Rxg8+ Kxg8 {And Black's activity should suffice for a draw despite White's
two extra pawns.}) 25. Kg2  Qc5  26. Bd5  g6 $2 {(07:21) This is just a waste
of time.} (26... axb2 27. Rxb2 Qc7 28. Rhb1 Qd7 29. Rb7 Rxb7 30. Rxb7 Bc7 31.
Qb3 {And White's attack may or may not be decisive but at least not sometimes
soon!}) 27. Rb1 $1 {(00:23) A strong move which assures White's control over
the seventh rank.} axb2  28. Raxb2  Kh8  29. Rb5  Qc8  30. Rb8  Qd7  31. Qd2 
Kg7  32. R8b7  Rxb7  33. Rxb7  Qg4 {(01:20) After the 6th round game between
L'Ami-Adhiban this is the second time I am commenting on opposite colored
bishops in a position concerning attack and defence! Since White has a strong
attack over the f7 square and Black's dark-squared bishop is helpless to defend
f7, it is as if White is a piece up in his attack. If you want to know who said
that for the first time, I encourage you to read our Round 6 report!} 34. Qa2
$18 {(03:31) White's attack is unstoppable.} Bxh4 {(02:13) equivalent to a
resignation.} 35. Qa7  Kh6  36. Rxf7  Rxf7  37. Qxf7  Bg5  38. Qf8+  Kh5  39.
Qxd6  Bf4  40. Qf6  Qg5  41. Qf7 {(01:53) Hracek reaction to Nepo's dubious
novelty was slow and inactive. Nepo did all he had to do, activated his bishop,
placed his rooks on the right squares and seized the seventh rank. He simply
asked Hracek a number of difficult questions in this game and unfortunately for
the Czechs and Hracek, he failed to answer them.} 1-0
