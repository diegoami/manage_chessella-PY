{An endgame question, which reminds me of my chess childhood in the Romanian
clubs: what is the strongest continuation for White?} 41. Qc6 {The rule of
thumbs our trainers always taught us was that knight endgames are similar to
the pawn ones - "To evaluate with more precision, eliminate mentally the
knights and think whether the pawn endgame is in your favour" was the lesson
we all received as kids. Of course, every rule has exceptions but that's not
the case for this game. Exchanging queens increases White's advantage due to
the presence of the potential outside passed pawn on the queenside.} Qxc6 42.
Nxc6 e6 ({Black would have loved to play} 42... e5 {freeing the f6-e6-d6 route
for the black king but, unfortunately, that runs into the direct} 43. Nb4 {
double attack.}) 43. b4 Kf6 {A natural move, bringing the king closer. Also} (
43... e5 {was not too late, grabbing more space and equality.}) 44. f4 Kf5 45.
Kf2 Ke4 46. Ke2 f6 47. Nd8 e5 48. Ne6 d4 49. fxe5 fxe5 50. Ng5+ Kf5 {
Objectively, the position is rather balanced and with correct play, the game
should end in a draw. But one can always try to give the opponent as many
headaches as possible. The Vietnamese player did that, can you see how?} 51.
Nxh7 {Ok, White wins a pawn but wasn't that a poisoned one?!} Nb6 {Doesn't
apply any pressure on White, who now enjoys a full pawn up for no visible
counterplay.} (51... dxe3 {was critical and the path Black should have taken
for half a point.} 52. Kxe3 g5 53. g4+ Kg6 54. Nxg5 Kxg5 55. Ke4 $11 {White
has an army of pawns to hold on to a draw.}) ({The immediate} 51... g5 {
was less accurate due to} 52. exd4 {Compared to the previous line where White
had already a lot of pawns, here another black one falls.} Kg6 53. Nxg5 Kxg5

Kf6 {An important win for the winner! Quite remarkable the 5/5 finish for the
bubbly Vietnamese, mother of 2 and chess teacher in her private school in
Vietnam. And when on a break, she wins tournaments...:)} 1-0

{One way or another, 'luck' is always needed. Best continuation for White?} 20.
a3 {allowed Black to not only come back into the game but it also offered a
big chance for an on the spot win.} (20. Na5 $1 {[%cal Ga2a3] and its
b4-antagonist is shivering in despair.} Bd8 {doesn't bring much relief because
of} 21. Nb7 {followed by a3.}) 20... bxc4 21. bxc4 {Now is the moment: what
should Black do?} Na2 {returning the favour.} ({Instead,} 21... Nxd3 {brings
home the bacon by sacrificing something first} 22. cxd3 Bd8 $1 {White's
position collapses. For example} 23. Kc2 Ba5 24. Rxe8 Rxe8 25. Bf1 Re3 $19 {
soon White's moves will be out of stock.}) 22. Bd5+ Kh8 23. Bc6 ({The greedy}

emotionless engine, the point being} Re2 34. g4 Rf6+ 35. Kg5 Rf2 {This is just
for illustrative purposes, to underline the fact that now the f4-pawn is
protected, which would have not been the case further on, had Black chosen the
best continuation.}) 33... Kh7 {Black missed the moment.} (33... Re2 {brings
the advantage back into Black's court.} 34. g4 Rf6+ 35. Kg5 Rf2 $17 {The
bishop is very much needed on c1...but now it is too late since Bd8 is also a
threat.}) 34. Bc1 {But White missed it too. It is now or never: keep that
king's march on, in a similar fashion to that famous game of Nigel Short.} (34.

{I remember that during this round, as I was passing by, Black's next move
impressed me a lot.} 16... Bxh3 $1 {It may look like a very 'natural'
continuation, in the spirit of the position, but it must be backed up with
serious calculation. The depths of Sophie's evaluations are outstanding,
especially considering what a difficult tournament start she had.} 17. Bg5 ({If
