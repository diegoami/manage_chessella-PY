cxd4 9. Bg5 h6 10. Bxf6 Qxf6 {[#] Caruana plays a Benoni with colors reversed.
A good opening to play for a win.} 11. Nbd2 Bc7 12. Qa4 O-O 13. b4 Bf5 14. Qb3
Rab8 {Objectively the position should be equal but it seems to be easier to
play for White who can advance his pawns on the queenside, play against the
pawn on e5 and rely on his white-squared bishop. Black, however, has a good
position but finds it more difficult to formulate a plan.} 15. Rfe1 a6 16. Rac1
Rfd8 17. a3 Qe7 $6 ({Maybe} 17... Ne7 {was more careful to avoid putting the
knight on the rim.}) 18. b5 Na5 19. Qb4 Qf6 20. Ne4 {[#]} Bxe4 $2 {During the
last moves White has gradually increased the pressure and after this exchange
he is clearly better.} ({But it is hard to propose sensible alternatives. The
following line which Fritz 15 recommends shows how difficult the position is
for Black:} 20... Qb6 21. Nh4 Be6 22. a4 {and now Fritz 15 gives} Qa7 23. Ng6
b6 {as best - with a clear advantage for White.}) 21. Rxe4 {[#]Black's knight
on a5 is really awkwardly placed - and White now simply threatens 22.Nxe5
winning a pawn. Black is helpless.} axb5 22. cxb5 Qb6 23. Nxe5 Bd6 24. Qb2 Rbc8
25. a4 Rxc1+ 26. Qxc1 Qc5 27. Qxc5 Bxc5 28. h4 h5 29. Bf3 g6 30. Rf4 {Black
resigned. He loses a second pawn because he cannot protect f7.} 1-0
