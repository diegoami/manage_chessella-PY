{This was an important game for both the players. Daniel Sadzikowski was
leading the event already with 5.0/5. Stupak Kirill was half a point behind.}
1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. g3 c5 $5 5. d5 {Usually White players avoid
playing d5, because it gives Black an option of going into the Benko or the
Benoni. While the fianchetto variation with g3 is quite potent against the
Benko, I think Benoni players would be very happy seeing the move d5.} b5 $5 (
5... e6 {transposing to Benko was also an option.}) 6. cxb5 Qa5+ 7. Bd2 Qxb5 8.
Nc3 Qb7 (8... Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. Nb5 $18) 9. e4 $1 {Adjusting to the new
scenario. It is true that g3 has been played, but the bishop will stand well on
c4.} O-O 10. Bc4 d6 11. O-O Bg4 12. Rb1 Nfd7 (12... Nbd7 {There was nothing
wrong with the normal development followed by Rfb8 and typical Benko like play.
}) 13. Be2 a5 14. Bf4 Na6 15. Kg2 Rfc8 16. Qd2 Nc7 (16... c4 $5 {was a move
that should have been looked into by Black.} 17. Nd4 Bxe2 18. Ncxe2 Nac5 19. f3
Nd3 20. Nc6 Nb8 $11 {And Black has a good position.}) 17. Rfc1 a4 18. h3 Bxf3+
19. Kxf3 $5 {The king comes out for a small outing. He will be sent back home
pretty soon!} c4 $6 {Taking with the king worked as Sadzikowski was tempted
into this risky pawn advance. The pawn on c4 is pretty weak now.} 20. Kg2 (20.
Bxc4 $2 g5 $1 {And with Ne5+ coming up, it is pretty bad for White.}) 20... Ne8
(20... Nb5 21. Nxb5 Qxb5 22. b3 $1 $16) 21. g4 Ne5 22. g5 Nc7 23. Be3 Na6 $2 {
Black just blunders the pawn and Stupak picks it up.} (23... e6 $5 $16) 24.
Nxa4 $18 {White is a pawn up and has a clearly better position. A knight fork
looms large on b6 and f4 is coming up. The rest was not at all difficult for
the Belarussian GM.} Nb4 (24... Nc5 25. Nxc5 dxc5 26. b3 $18) 25. Nb6 $1 Ned3
26. Nxc8 (26. Rxc4 $1 Rxc4 27. Nxc4 $18) 26... Nxc1 27. Rxc1 Nxa2 (27... Rxc8
28. Bxc4 $18 {is just two extra pawns.}) 28. Nxe7+ Qxe7 29. Rxc4 Qe5 30. Bf4
Qe7 (30... Qxb2 31. Qxb2 Bxb2 32. Bxd6 $18) 31. Qc2 Be5 32. Bd2 Qb7 33. b4 Ra3
34. b5 Qd7 35. Bd3 Kg7 36. Ra4 Rxa4 37. Qxa4 Nc3 38. Qb3 Qc8 39. b6 {A very
nice game by Stupak Kirill, who won by making simple and logical moves.} 1-0
