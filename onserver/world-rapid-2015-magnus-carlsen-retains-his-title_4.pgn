{Black's last move was c6-c5. But with his king in the centre and White fully
developed, this is not a position that you would like to have against Vishy
Anand.} 17. Rfe1+ Be7 18. Rxe7+ $1 {This sacrifice is as natural as a baby's
smile for Anand, although it must be said he took 4 minutes to execute it.
Maybe the younger Anand would not have taken so much time.} Kxe7 19. Re1+ Ne5
20. Qc2 (20. Qa6 Qe6 21. Qa5 Qc6 22. Bxe5 fxe5 23. Nxe5 $18 {was the faster way
to finish off the opponent.}) 20... Rhe8 21. Bxe5 (21. Qxh7+ Kd8 $17) 21...
fxe5 22. Nxe5 Kd6 {Maybe this is something that Vishy missed. The queen cannot
be taken because of the mate on the back rank but his compensation is not at
all in doubt.} 23. f4 Qg7 24. b4 $1 {Another nice move trying to get to the
black king.} c4 25. Qc3 Qc7 26. Kh1 Rac8 27. Rd1 Qb6 28. Qxc4 $1 {Anand is in
his element here.} Rxc4 29. Nxc4+ Kc6 30. Nxb6 axb6 31. Kg1 $16 {White is
clearly better in this endgame and went on to win this game. It was good to see
Vishy showing some sparkling chess for which he is so well known.} 1-0
