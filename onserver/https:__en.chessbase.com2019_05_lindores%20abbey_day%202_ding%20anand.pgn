bxa5 34. Nxa5 Ra6 35. Rxb7+ Ke8 36. Nb3 {What is the objective assessment of
the position? Difficult to say, whether White will be able to win this or not,
but he is definitely under a lot of pressure and Black has to be very careful.}
Kf8 37. h4 Re8 38. Nd4 Re7 39. Rb8+ Kf7 40. Nf5 Rd7 41. h5 {Ding Liren has
slowly improved his position, but it is not so easy to find a weakness where
he can latch onto. At the same time White can endlessly keep manoeuvring
hoping for Anand to commit a tactical blunder. The chances of this happening
are not naught, but I think Ding Liren believed that he could do something
constructive and overpressed.} Ra5 42. Nd6+ Ke6 43. Nb5 Kf5 44. Kg2 Kg4 45. h6
g5 46. Be3 Kh5 47. Rb6 Kg6 48. g4 $6 {What could be more natural to fix the
square on f5 and get ready for Nd6-f5! Well the problem is that for this one
move the g4 pawn is undefended and Anand manages to get his rook in a very
aggressive and active position.} (48. Kf3 Rd3 49. Nd6 $18) 48... Ra4 $1 49. Kg3
Rb4 $1 {Suddenly Ding has to start playing carefully. He wants to remove his
knight from b5, but it would mean that he has to allow the exchange of rooks
and he loses the h6 pawn. This was the right thing to do but the Chinese
player wanted to win!} 50. Kf3 Rd3 $1 {Once Anand gets counterplay, he is in
his element.} 51. Rb8 Kxh6 52. Rb6 Kg6 53. Rb8 $2 (53. Rd6 {was the last
chance.} Rxe3+ 54. Kxe3 Rxb5 55. f3 $11 {And this will be a draw.}) 53... Rdb3
$1 54. Rg8+ Kf7 55. Rh8 Kg7 {And just like that from a very promising position,
Ding Liren lost the game. Anand fought hard and stayed in the game, but one
has to feel for Ding who might have won the tournament had he won this game!}
