Yifan did not scare him off.} 6. f3 {with this move order White prevents ...Ng4, which would follow 6.Be3} (6. Be3 Ng4 {which Navara selected in the previous round against Hou}) 6... e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8.

previous games. White has the advantage of the bishop pair, but Black has
the more active rooks, the Be6 is well placed and his king is
