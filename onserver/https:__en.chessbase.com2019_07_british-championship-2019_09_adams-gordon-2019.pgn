1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nd7 4. Ba4 {A recent discovery, and one that
contains some venom. As he explained in the post game interview, Adams was
quite happy here as Stephen started thinking which indicated that he didn't
know the line.} Ngf6 5. O-O a6 ({According to Adams taking the pawn was not a
good idea.} 5... Nxe4 6. Re1 Nef6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 {[#] with mounting
pressure. The knight is threatening to hop into b5 or f5.}) 6. c4 $1 {
preventing ...b5 feels necessary.} e5 7. d3 g6 $6 (7... Be7 {"perhaps I should
have thought for a bit longer here" Stephen Gordon. I think in the game he was
concerned about the idea of Nh4, hopping into f5.} 8. Nh4 O-O (8... g6 9. Bh6
Ng8 {was suggested by Adams.} 10. Bg7 Bxh4 11. Bxh8 {and Adams seems concerned
that the bishop on h8 might not get out, although the engine gives White
almost a winning edge here.}) 9. Nf5 b5 10. cxb5 Nb6 {with reasonable
counterplay for Black.}) 8. Nc3 Bg7 9. Rb1 O-O 10. h3 {[#] I think Black's
main problem in this position is that the knight on d7 clogs up his
development- you have to move it b6 to develop the bishop, so Adams plays a
typical prophylatic move, h3, designed to prevent Black's later ...Bg4.  The
way White is playing in this game rather reminds me of some training games
that I've had when playing Black against Stockfish in similar positions; where
the metal monster has played c4, prevented Black's counterplay and then got on
with the thematic b4 break. This game felt eerily similar.  As computers often
tend to be quite consistent in their approach I wondered during commentary of
this game whether Adams had been inspired by the Matthew Sadler videos (that
you can find on Youtube) documenting Alpha Zero's analysis of the 3.Bb5 games
in the recent world championship match. Or perhaps Adams has been working with
Alpha Zero directly, or simply been helped by Sadler? In any case Stephen's
practical problems over the board seem considerable.} Ne8 (10... Nh5 {feels
like a slightly funkier way to play the posiiton, although it's still
difficult for Black to create counterplay on the kingside.}) 11. b4 {It's
interesting that Adams played b4 directly, without bothering to prepare it
with a3 first. According to him it felt like quite a "quick" position. White's
long term pressure down the b-file and the activity of his pieces more than
compensate for Black gaining access to the c5 square for his knight.} cxb4 12.
Rxb4 Nc5 13. Nd5 {[#]} b5 $6 (13... Nc7 $1 14. Nb6 Rb8 {with a manageable game
for Black.}) (13... Be6 $5 {was suggested by Adams.} 14. Bg5 Qa5) 14. cxb5 Bd7

Rxb6 {When Black is still on the board.}) (14... axb5 15. Bxb5 Rxa2 16. Bg5 f6
17. Bc4 $1 {is an important tactical point.}) 15. b6 $1 {A thematic, and
winning exchange sacrifice. The knight on d5 combined with the pawn on b6
become to much for Black to cope with.} Nxa4 16. Rxa4 Bxa4 17. Qxa4 f6 (17...
h6 18. Be3 f5 19. b7 Rb8 20. Bb6 $1 {[#] was pointed out by Adams afterwards.})
