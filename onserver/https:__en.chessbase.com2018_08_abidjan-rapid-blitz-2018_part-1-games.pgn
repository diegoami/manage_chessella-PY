{The top seed and the best African, Arab and Egyptian GM, Bassem Amin, was
undisputedly the main contender for the first place. With a double win of both
components of Rapid and Blitz, the overall winner showed there is a reason why
everyone pointed him as the clear favourite. However, turning up to the game
is not sufficient for a win and despite the rather big rating gap "the other
players displayed very good chess and I got in trouble at some point of the
rapid section." (Bassem) Your author didn't discover those troubles and here
is a beautiful example of dynamic play which culminates with an exchange
sacrifice in Petrosian style.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. Nbd2
Nge7 6. Bg2 g6 7. O-O Bg7 8. Re1 O-O 9. h4 h6 10. e5 {Bassem is a frequent
employer of this system which is indeed very suitable for faster time controls.
} a5 11. a4 b6 12. Nb1 (12. Nf1 {-h2-g4 is the standard manoeuvre in this
position but White has set his sights on the b5-square.}) 12... Qc7 13. Bf4 d4
14. Qc1 Kh7 15. Na3 Ba6 16. Nc4 ({I like} 16. g4 $5 {in order to meet} Nd5 {
with} 17. Bg3 {when White can slowly keep building on his impending attack
while it's not clear where Black should seek his counterplay.}) 16... Nd5 17.

gxh5 ({Also here} 19... g5 {was called for, though} 20. Nxg5+ hxg5 21. Bxg5
Bxc4 22. Be4+ {is a tricky position for Black. Now} Kh8 23. Bf6 $1 {is already
losing, but 22...Nf5 keeps Black in the game.}) 20. Re4 (20. Nh4 $1 Ng6 21. Qd1
$1 {were two power moves that would have seriously placed Black's 19th move in
doubt.}) 20... Ng6 21. Qe1 Nce7 22. Qe2 {A fascinating position in which the
most natural move turns out to be a mistake.} Bb7 (22... Nf5 $1 {would have
prevented White's next move.}) 23. Nh4 $1 {Very elegant. White is ready to
give an exchange on e4, but taking it leads to a deadly attack.} Nf5 (23...
Bxe4 24. Bxe4 Kg8 25. Qxh5 Nxe5 26. Bf4 f6 27. Nxe5 fxe5 28. Bxh6 {is,
materially speaking, not so bad for Black, but positionally it's all over.})
24. Qxh5 Nfxh4 25. Rxh4 $5 Nxh4 26. Qxh4 {Black's main problem is that he
can't bring his pieces to the kingside in order to assist the king.} Rh8 27.

{Whenever a trainer complains for lack of material, that should raise a
serious question whether he/she is such a good instructor afterall. The Rapid
games alone are carrying an abundance of examples, as it is the case with this
one. White has a couple of equally good options of continuing the pressure but
which one would you choose?} 31. Qd3 ({I particularly like the backward} 31.

the Rapid, which gave him some leverage for a less storming 1st Blitz day.} 0-1

{When things move so quickly as it is the case with Blitz games, controlling
all the factors involved in the final results is a bit of an utopia. And yet,
when you lose one game and then another, something must be done, something
must change to save you from disaster. Luckily, Kenny trained his physical
srength before the competition, so he could run upstairs, change his shirt and
be in time for his next game. Guess what, it worked! He won a very important
R4, Day 2 Blitz game against the GM from Tanta.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
