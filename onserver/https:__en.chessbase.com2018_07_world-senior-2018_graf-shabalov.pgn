Na5 $5 {It is funny how this game, or, even more particularly, this move 
(objectively not such a great one), finally made me realize that i am playing
in World Seniors. I received so many compliments and comments from other
players about the virtues of Na5 that it became blatantly clear - for most of
them modern theory stopped developing about 20 years ago.Of course, currently
8...Na5 is probably even more popular than 8...Rb8.} 9. Nc1 Nd7 {[#]} 10. Nb3 {
very solid continuation from a seasoned professional which took him way too
much time (about 50 min). The reason was, as Alexander himself explained it
after the game, that he simply could not believe that this move (Na5) exists
and was actively looking for a direct refutation. During the game i
interpreted his long thought a little different.} ({by the way it is very easy
to go wrong with white as the following game shown.} 10. Be2 c5 11. O-O cxd4

frustrated Aman stopped the clock ...0-1 (14) Hambleton,A (2463)-Shabalov,A

16. axb4 Ra1+ 17. Rb1 Rxb1+ 18. Nxb1 {i came up with some improvements for
black and thought that Alex was also trying to find ways to avoid some nasty
opening surprise. However during our conversation he failed to remember this
game at all! It was only until much later that it dawned on me: Felix Graf and
Alexander Graf are two different players.Welcome to Senior curcuit!} f5 19. Nc3

[#] It may look like a preparation for f6-f5, but in fact black sets up a
cheap trap. In a very serious time trouble the leader of Lasker Chess Club
steps right into it.} 28. Ra1 Nxb4 $3 {the cheap shot , of course, but the
