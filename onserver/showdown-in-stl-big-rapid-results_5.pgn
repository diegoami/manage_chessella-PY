A rare guest in top level chess simply because Black players consider it to be
too dangerous. Hou Yifan, however, has never cared - she has always played it
with confidence.} 7. h4 e5 8. Nf5 Be6 9. Bg2 g6 10. Ne3 Nc6 11. Ncd5 Bxd5 12.
Nxd5 Nxd5 13. exd5 Ne7 14. Be3 Bg7 15. Qd2 Qd7 16. O-O-O Qxg4 $5 { Giong for a
risky pawn grab, but Parimarjan Negi replies with power and precision.} 17. f4

ambitious, it's possible that Hou Yifan should have gone for the draw.} 23. f5
g5 24. Rdg1 Kh8 25. Be4 {It's very clear that despite Black's two extra pawns,
Black is suffering. Her pieces on the kingside are weak and about to be
trapped. She also has no counterplay.} Bf6 26. Bf2 Rg8 27. Kb1 (27. Rg4 Qxg4
