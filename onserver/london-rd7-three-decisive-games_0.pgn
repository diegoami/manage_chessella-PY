1. d4  d5  2. c4  c6 
3. Nf3  Nf6  4. e3  Bg4  5. h3  Bh5
 6. cxd5  cxd5  7. Nc3 {Played after nearly twenty
minutes of thought. It was sure that Magnus had come to the board with
an intention to play an original game.} e6  8. g4  Bg6
 9. Ne5 {This line hasn't been played much. Anand defeated Tregubov
with the black pieces here, but apart from that there haven't really been
any top level games.} Nfd7  10. Nxg6  hxg6  11.
Bg2  Nc6  12. e4 $5 {When you have the bishop pair you
must open up the position.} dxe4  13. Nxe4  Bb4+ 
14. Nc3  Nb6  15. O-O  O-O  (15... Nxd4
16. Be3 Nc6 17. Qb3 {gives White ample free diagonals and activity for
the pawn.}) 16. d5 $1 {Further opening up the position.} exd5  17.
Nxd5  Bc5 $1  (17... Nxd5 18. Qxd5 Qxd5 19. Bxd5 Rfd8 20.
Rd1 {is quite a pleasant position for White who has the bishop pair.})
18. Nc3  Bd4  19. Qf3  Qf6  20. Qxf6
 Bxf6  21. Bf4  Rad8  22. Rad1 
Bxc3 $5 {After 21 minutes Nakamura thinks this is the best decision -
to give up his bishop and leave White with a weak pawn. But in hindisght
it might not have been the best because now the play is completely one
sided with the bishops dominating the knights.} (22... Nc4 23. b3 Bxc3
24. bxc4 Nd4 25. Bg5 Rd7 {could have been possible but even here after}
26. Kh1 $14 {With Be3 coming up Black is not so solid.}) 23. bxc3 
Na4  24. c4  Nc3  25. Rd2 $1 {Magnus is very strong
at finding such resources which make his opponent's task of equalizing
very difficult.} Rxd2  (25... Nd4 26. Re1 $16) 26. Bxd2 
Ne2+  27. Kh2  Rd8  28. Be3  Nc3  29.
a3  Rd3  30. Rc1  Nd1  31. Be4 
Rd7  32. Bc5  Nb2  33. Rc2  Na4 
34. Be3  Nb6  35. c5  Nd5  36. Rd2 
Nf6  37. Rxd7  Nxd7 {And there we have it! The pure double
bishop against double knight endgame. It didn't seem that Hikaru would
lose this position, especially because his knight on c6 was so firmly
placed supported by the pawn on b7. However, one thing was for sure -
White had an edge and he could play on forever. This is a bad position
to be in as Black, especially if you are facing Magnus Carlsen.} 38. Kg3
 Kf8  39. f4 {Magnus was critical of this move after the
game. According to him if he hadn't made this move it would have given
him more flexibility and that square could have been used by his king
or the bishop.} Nf6  40. Bf3  Ke7  41. f5 {This move
was probably necessary because Ke6 is not something that White would like
to allow.} gxf5  42. gxf5  Kd7  43. Kf4  Ne8
 44. Kg5  Ke7  45. Bf4  a6 {One of those
pawn moves which should have been avoided in hindsight. But how does one
decide whether such moves are good or not? Well it all depends on your
intuition at this point and any pawn move seems incorrect in this position
as it creates fresh weaknesses. We will see in the game how the move a7-a6
comes to haunt Black at a crucial moment.} 46. h4  Kf8 
47. Bg3  Nf6  48. Bd6+  Ke8  49. Kf4 
Nd7  50. Bg2  Kd8  51. Kg5  Ke8

Nf6+  55. Kg5  Nh7+  56. Kh4  gxh6 
57. Kh5  Nf6+  58. Kxh6 {The king gets in to the game. You
can see how little by little Magnus is building up his advantage.} Ng4+
 59. Kg7  Nd4 $5  60. Be4  (60. Bxb7 Nxf5+
61. Kh7 Nf6+ 62. Kh8 Nxd6 63. cxd6 Kd7 $11) 60... Nf2  61. Bb1
 (61. Bxb7 Nxf5+ $11) 61... Ng4  62. Bf4  f6 $2
{Now this should have been surely avoided. Hikaru misses one of Magnus'
tricks in the next few moves. But one should avoid moving the pawn to
f6 on general grounds as now that pawn is much more vulnerable than it
was on f7.} 63. Be4  Nf2  64. Bb1 { Magnus was low on time
and needed those last few seconds to calculate the consequences of Bxb7.
Until then he repeats one more time.} Ng4  65. Be4  Nf2 
66. Bxb7 $1  Nd3  (66... Nxf5+ 67. Kxf6 Nd4 68. c6 $18 {And
Black is busted.}) 67. Kxf6 $3  (67. Bd6 Nxf5+ 68. Kxf6 Nxd6 69.
Bc6+ $1 (69. cxd6 Kd7 70. Bxa6 Nc5 {leads to a drawn endgame.}) 69...
Kd8 70. cxd6 Nb2 71. Ke6 {and whether is ending is winning for White is
unclear. Magnus' solution was much much clearer.}) 67... Nxf4 {Nakamura
used almost all of his remaining time to play this move. It suddenly dawned
on him that he was being dragged in to a completely lost position.} 68.
Ke5  Nfe2  69. f6 $6  (69. Bxa6 Nf3+ 70. Ke4 Ng5+
71. Ke3 Nc3 {leads to a very funny material balance position, but Black
should hold this.}) (69. c6 $1 { would have led to an easy win.} Nxf5
(69... Kd8 70. f6 $18) (69... Nf3+ 70. Ke4 Ng5+ 71. Ke3 Kd8 72. Kxe2 $18)
70. Kxf5 Nd4+ 71. Ke5 $18) 69... a5 {Saving the pawn and keeping the game
alive.} 70. a4  Kf7  71. Bd5+  Kf8 $2 {The final
error.} (71... Kg6 $1 {Things would not really have been clear after this.}
72. Be4+ Kf7 73. c6 Nxc6+ 74. Bxc6 Kf8 $11 {As Magnus said during the
post game conference.: he was sure that White should be winning this endgame,
but the more he looked at it, the more he realized that there was no way
to break through.}) 72. Ke4 $1 {Only move to win.} Nc2  73. c6
 Nc3+  74. Ke5  Nxa4 75. Bb3 $1  Nb6 
76. Bxc2  a4  77. c7  Kf7  (77... a3 78. Bb3
Ke8 79. f7+ Ke7 80. Kd4 $18) 78. Bxa4 {What was this if not technique
at the highest possible level? Carlsen's win shows to everyone out there
that opening theory is important, but there is nothing that can replace
solid endgame skills and knowledge. The way he ground out this win will
surely go down as one of the best technical efforts ever.} 1-0
