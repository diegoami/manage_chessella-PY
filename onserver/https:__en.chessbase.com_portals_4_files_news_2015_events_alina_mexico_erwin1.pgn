{I must say that Erwin, aka my husband, adjusted very well with the 7 hours
time difference and that jet lag caused him minimal damages, especially since
the organizers made sure we will arrive earlier, two days before the event
started. (Now mother nature is laughing in our faces, as at 4 am CET, our eyes
are widely open...but time will fix that soon:)  The 6th game was crucial for
the top seed: had Black won, he would have challenged for the 1st place Emilio
Cordova in the last round. Unfortunately, this is not what happened, but
chances were present!  The question for you is: would} 62... h4 {seal Black's
victory?} (62... Rd1+ {was played in the game, which only helped White to
bring its king closer and support the c-pawn.} 63. Ke5 Rc1 64. Kd6 {The Dutch
GM is a very kind and calm person, who loves the game tremendously much. But I
rarely, if ever, saw him so angry because of these two unnecessary rook moves.
Chess is a violent game indeed, a serene sea on the surface and hurricanes
beneath.} h4 65. c6 g5 66. Ra5 Kg6 67. Rc5 Rd1+ 68. Ke5 Rd8 69. c7 Rc8 70. Ke4
g4 71. Kf4 g3 72. Kf3 Kf6 73. Rc4 Ke6 74. Rxh4 Rxc7 75. Kxg3 {Nothing to play
for - draw.}) {When we briefly looked at the endgame in the tournament hall,
everybody thought it was indeed winning for Black, with such a dangerous Usain
Bolt on the h-file. But I had my reserves and I am happy my instintcs were
right: White is holding!} 63. c6 Rc1 64. Ra6 $1 {Defending the pawn and
waiting for Black's response, after which White will decide accordingly. I
wonder what Abreu Delgado would have played, as the tendency in the last
couple of moves was not in his favour and the position started to deteriorate
slowly. From a practical point of view, I believe it was nearly impossible to
find this move, which is so incredibly natural and logical once seen! Maybe he
would have played like this, or maybe not, we'll never know...} g5 (64... h3 {
allows} 65. Ra3) ({while} 64... Kh6 {doesn't bring anything either} 65. Kd5 g6
66. Kd6) 65. Ra5 {No time for regretting the past, as the 7th round was bound
to start in one hour! And the Dutch GM did what a grandmaster does: stood up,
made the dust fly and won the final game, which I will show you in a moment
since I believe it is very interesting for the endgame theory!} 1/2-1/2
