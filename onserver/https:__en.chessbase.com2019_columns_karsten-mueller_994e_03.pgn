to Bähr's rule because Black's passed pawn crossed the diagonal c2-h7. When
the kings stand as they do here the rule is: with blocked outside pawns and a
passed pawn that is on the d-, e-, f-, g- or h-file and has not crossed the
middle of the board the diagonal is drawn from the outside pawn of the
defender to one's own c-file and then the diagonal is drawn towards the
attacker's back rank. If the passed pawn crossed this diagonal - as in this
example - the position is drawn, otherweise it is won (if, e.g., the pawn
would be on f5 and the kings on e3 and e5 the position would be won for Black).
