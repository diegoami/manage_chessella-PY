{Round four was under the spell of the Ukraine-Russia match! Two of the top
guns in the Olympiad since the fall of the Soviet Union and the two countries
in political conflict! That would be enough tension to win most of the
attention of the fourth round at the Baku Chess Olympiad. In a 'black' day in
this match, ex-FIDE world champion, Ruslan Ponomariov, delivered one of the two
victories for the Ukrainian team to let his teammates edge Russia 2.5-1.5} 1.
d4  Nf6  2. c4  e6  3. Nf3  b6  4. g3  Bb7 {(17s) Ponomariov adopts this
classical system in the QID over 4...Ba6} 5. Bg2  Be7  6. O-O  O-O  7. Nc3  (7.
Re1 {is another common move in this opening.}) 7... Ne4  8. Bd2  Bf6  (8... f5
{ is considered the main line. Ponomariov goes for a less theoretical, yet more
passive continuation.}) 9. Rc1 {(606s) Surprised by Pono's choice, Tomashevsky
goes for the mainline after thinking for a while.} Nxd2  10. Qxd2  d6  11. d5 
e5  12. e4 {(112s) Here comes the typical position arising after Bf6. White has
given up on his pair of bishops but he manages to have more space and Black's
bishop pair is not doing much in this position. To sum it up in one sentence:
Black does not have any weaknesses but he is passive and has less space.} Nd7 
13. h4  (13. b4 a5 14. a3 g6 15. h4 Bg7 16. Bh3 Nf6 {could have been an
alternative continuation here. There are not so many games in this line in the
database.}) 13... a5 {(282s) This stops White's play on the queenside but now
White has enough time to shut down any Black activity on the kingside and plan
a long-term campaign thanks to his space advantage.} 14. Bh3  Nc5  15. Kg2  Bc8
 16. Bxc8  Qxc8  17. Qe2 {(124s) A quick evaluation: White has a small edge
thanks to Black's passive bishop on f6. The case of White losing this game is
almost unthinkable.} Be7  18. Nd2  Nd7  (18... f5 19. exf5 Qxf5 20. Nde4 {would
only give away the beautiful e4 square to White's knights.}) (18... g6 19. h5 {
and White is faster to mobalize his pieces on the h-file.}) 19. Rh1 {(599s)
White prepares an assault on the kingside. Black's position is very unpleasant.
He does not have any counterplay and White is gradually grinding his advantage
with no risk.} Nf6  20. Nf1 {(196s) This knight is going to land on e3. This is
too typical to earn an exclamation mark!} h5  21. Ne3  g6  22. Rcg1 $1 {(319s)
Now we know what Tomashevsky's long-term plan is. He is preparing a king-march
to the queenside in order to keep his king safe before the final attack. This
concept was first introduced by the 9th world chess champion Tigran Petrosian.}
Kg7  23. Kf1  Rh8 $1 { (33s) Ponomariov is ready to face g4.} 24. Ke1  Qd7  25.
Kd1  Kg8  26. f3  Bf8 $1 {(103s) QID position has transformed into a KID
position. Now Black's King's Indian bishop finds a nice spot: the bishop goes
to g7 or h6 to cover his mighty king.} 27. g4 { (47s) Tomashevsky starts his
attack.} Rh7  28. Kc2  Be7  29. Rg2  (29. g5 Ne8 30. Kb1 Bf8 31. Rf1 Bg7 32.
Nb5 Rh8 33. f4 { I wonder how Black is going to defend f7.} exf4 34. Rxf4 Be5
35. Rf3 Kg7 36. Rhf1 Rf8 37. Qf2 Kg8 38. Nc2 Ng7 39. Ncd4 Rae8 40. Nc6 Qg4 41.
Qc2 $1 {Black seems to be completely out of any useful move.} Qd7 (41... Qxh4
42. Nxc7) 42. Qd3 Qc8 43. Nxe5 Rxe5 44. Nd4 a4 45. Nc6 Ree8 46. Rf4 Qd7 47. Qf3
$18) 29... Qd8  30. Kb1  Kh8  31. Nf1  (31. g5 {[#] should be considered a
strong alternative.}) 31... Nd7  32. Rgh2  Kg7  33. Rh3 $4 {(46s) I do not
understand... Doesn't this just lose a pawn?!} hxg4  34. fxg4  Rxh4 {(6s)
Ponomariov grabs the pawn!} 35. Rxh4  Bxh4  36. Qh2  Bg5 $1 {(24s) Ponomariov
keeps his head cool, the bishop goes to f4 and covers everything including the
f-file. Black is much better now.} 37. Qh7+  Kf8  38. Nh2  Qf6  39. Rf1  Bf4 
40. Nf3  Ke7 {(0s) Tomashevsky has managed to transform his position from much
better to slightly better and five moves later he is totally lost!} 41. Rh1 
Bg3  42. Nd2  Qf4  43. Qh3  Nf6 {(193s) Mercilessly, Pono grabs the second
pawn. The game is practically over.} 44. Qg2  Qxg4  45. Ne2  Bf4  46. Nxf4 
exf4  47. Qf1  Nh5  48. Qd3  Kf8  49. a3  Re8  50. Ka2  Kg7  51. Nf3  Nf6  52.
Re1  Nd7 {(70s) The final phase: Black trades the knights and he will gradually
push his extra pawns.} 53. Qc3+  Ne5  54. Rf1  Qh3  55. Qc1  Nxf3  56. Qc3+  f6
 57. Rxf3  Qg4  58. Qd3  Rh8 {(15s) Tomashevsky had enough. Ponomariov was well
rewarded for his passive 'waiting' strategy. What can I say about Tomashevsky's
blunder? Well, when the tension is high we can all make mistakes. After all, we
are human!} 0-1
