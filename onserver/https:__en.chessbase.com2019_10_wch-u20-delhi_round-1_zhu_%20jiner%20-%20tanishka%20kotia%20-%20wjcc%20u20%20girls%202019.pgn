{A great responsibility was the local player Tanishka, facing the number 1 of
the tournament, although she came out lower in the opening, she knew how to
recover and even had a clear chance of victory. Duel very enjoyable to observe
which in the end left both players with half a point in the pocket} 1. e4 c5 2.
