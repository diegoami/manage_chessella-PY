{It is known that the PokerStars Isle of Man tournament is a very tough one
for everybody, including for the top seeds. However, in R5 the number one
rated player in the event won with a typical trick in the Scandinavian against
a talented young boy, who still almost repeated his performance from last year:
GM norm back then and an IM one this time. Just that this game went wrong from
the very beginning and if you like this opening for Black, keep an eye for:} 8.
Nb5 $1 Qb6 ({Obviously} 8... Qd8 {allows mate in one} 9. Nd6#) 9. Nd6+ Kd8 10.
Nxf5 {and the rest was trivial for the renown English GM.} 1-0
