{After a wild and complicated game the players have ended in this absolutely
amazing position! Black has 11 pieces left, all of them on white squares. All
WhiteÂ´s pieces are on black squares with one logical exception - his
light-squared bishop!} 56. Nxd5 $1 h5 57. Bh3 Rb7 58. Nf6+ $1 {A real crowd
pleaser!} (58. a8=Q Qxa8 59. Qxc6 {Probably easier but obviously a more boring
alternative.}) 58... Kh8 59. Nxe8 Rxb6 60. axb6 Bxe8 61. Rxe6 Bf7 62. Rxc4 $1 {
