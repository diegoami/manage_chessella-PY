1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 b6 5. Bd3 Bb7 6. Nf3 Ne4 7. O-O {Denker
liked to attack and does not mind to give a pawn in the opening.} Nxc3 8. bxc3
Bxc3 9. Rb1 Ba5 10. Ba3 d6 {White has compensation for the pawn: Black's
bishop on a5 is out of play, Black has not castled yet, and Black still has to
develop his queenside. The engines evaluate the position as roughly equal.} 11.
c5 O-O 12. cxd6 cxd6 13. e4 Re8 14. e5 dxe5 15. Nxe5 {Eying f7 and h7 but
Black's next move seems to parry White's attack.} Qg5 16. g3 {White weakens
the white squares around his king and the pawn on g3 makes it more difficult
for the white rooks to position themselves for an attack against Black's king.
But White has other threats.} g6 $6 {Black secures his position on the
kingside but neglects to develop his queenside. However, White's has more
threats than it seems at first sight.} ({After e.g.} 16... Nc6 {White can
sacrifice with} 17. Nxf7 $5 {and now the engines propose the following wild
line:} Kxf7 18. Rb5 Qh6 19. Rh5 Qf6 20. Rh4 Bb4 21. Bxb4 Nxb4 22. Rf4 Qxf4 23.
gxf4 Nxd3 24. Qxd3 Kg8 25. Re1 Bd5 {with equality.}) 17. Qa4 Qd8 {Black is in
great danger, e.g.} (17... Rc8 18. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 19. Rxc1 Qd8 20. d5 Bxd5 21. Qf4
f5 22. Nxg6 $1 hxg6 23. Qh6 {with a winning attack for White.}) 18. Rfc1 b5 {
A creative counter which White counters creatively.} ({The best move was} 18...
Na6 {and after} 19. Bb5 Qd5 20. Bc6 Bxc6 21. Nxc6 Qd7 22. Qc4 Nb8 23. Nxa5 bxa5
24. Rb5 {the engines give White a slight plus.}) 19. Bxb5 Qd5 20. f3 Bb6 {
That's the counter Black had in mind.} 21. Rc5 {A nice countermove.} ({However,
as the engines note without sense or feeling for beauty, White also had the
prosaic} 21. Bxe8 {though he should see that after} Bxd4+ 22. Kg2 Bxe5 23. Qb3
Qd2+ 24. Kh1 Bd5 {he has the "zwischenzug"} 25. Rd1 {after which White is
winning.}) 21... Bxc5 22. Bxc5 $1 {Suddenly, all the black pieces are in
danger. Black loses material.} Rf8 23. Bc4 Bc6 {Otherwise Black loses the
bishop on b7.} 24. Bxd5 Bxa4 25. Bxa8 {White is simply a piece up. Black
resigned.} 1-0
