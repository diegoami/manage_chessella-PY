expand c3-c4, but objectively it is still not a sin to carry on with this]} (

pressured to 'do something' on the board rather than to wait for White's
assaults and defend them]} (26... Rc8 {[Inserting of this move was very
important for Black's defence]} 27. Ra6 Nc3 28. Bf4 Be5 {[The difference here
