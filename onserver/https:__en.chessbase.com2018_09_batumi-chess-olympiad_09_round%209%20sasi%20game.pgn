1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Bb4 {Sasi added Ragozin to his already
broad opening arsenal very recently in 2018.} 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bxf6 Qxf6 7. Qa4+
Nc6 8. e3 O-O 9. Be2 {A well known setup in Ragozin. White plays for black's
c8 bishop and misplaced knight on c6. Black has many ways to play here and
different players have tried different plans from black side. Usually black is
doing fine here as per the current theory.} Bd7 (9... dxc4 {This move is
Aronian's favorite. He tried it four times as black.} 10. O-O Bd7 11. Bxc4 Bxc3
12. bxc3 Rfd8 {Last time he played this was against Karjakin in 2018.} 13. Qa3

-Aronian,L (2764) Stavanger 2018}) 10. Qb3 dxc4 11. Qxc4 Qe7 (11... Qg6 12. O-O
Bd6 {This is Chinese style. Many top Chinese player are doing this. Mainly Yu
Yangi has played this a lot. Idea is to simply play Na5 next and change queens.
} 13. Rfd1 Na5 14. Qd3 Qxd3 15. Bxd3 {Yu Yangi tried this from black side
number of times with good result. It was also played twice successfully by
Eesha when she drew against Diptayan and Vidit.}) (11... Bd6 12. O-O Qg6 {
Another move order to get the same position discussed above.}) 12. O-O Bd6 {
I am not sure if Sasi mixed up his preparation or willingly opted for this
setup. Somehow, I don't like this idea. It’s a bit too late and little
passive to play for Bd6-e5 now. White will be in time to create some pressure
in the meantime.} (12... Na5 $1 {Wojtaszek played this move thrice which in my
opinion is the most critical in this position.} 13. Qxc7 {otherwise c5 was
coming} Rac8 14. Qe5 Bxc3 15. bxc3 Qa3 16. Nd2 (16. Rac1 Rxc3 17. Rxc3 Qxc3 18.

(52)-1/2 (52) Vachier Lagrave,M (2758)-Wojtaszek,R (2724) Saint-Quentin 2014})
13. Ne4 $14 {I already like white's position.} Rfc8 (13... e5 14. d5 Nb8 {
with the bishop on d7 black now will have to waste few more moves to get the
knight into game. Clearly this is not the way black wants to play.}) (13... a5

Moiseenko,A (2677)-Michalik,P (2558) Minsk 2017}) 14... e5 15. d5 Nd8 {It
already looks like something has gone wrong for black. The knight clearly
doesn't belong to d8.} 16. Nxd6 (16. Qb3 $1 $14 {would have been stronger})

18. Ba6 $142 Rc5 {but then where will the d8 knight go?} 19. Nd2 {As black is
not able to take on d5 yet} Bc8 (19... Rxd5 20. Qe4 Be6 21. Bc4 Qb7 22. Bxd5

here so I assume he was probably considering if to play Nb7 directly or after
taking on c1.} (18... Rxc1+ 19. Rxc1 Nb7 {[%cal Gb7c5]} 20. Rc7 {Just a
temporary placement for the rook} (20. Qa3 Qd8 {not fun to play like this but
white is not able to put immediate pressure.} 21. Ba6 Nc5 22. b4 Nxa6 23. Qxa6

dynamically balanced.}) 19. Rxc8+ Bxc8 (19... Rxc8 $142 20. Ba6 Rc7 21. Bxb7

on 'c' file but engine holds without much trouble.}) 20. Rc1 Nc5 $6 (20... Bd7

before.}) 21. Qa3 $1 {now b4 is unstoppable.} Bf5 (21... a5 22. b4 $16) (21...

25. Qxa7 $1 {I am absolutely certain that Sasi didn't miss this. Under the
given circumstances this is all he could do to make things messy in order to
provoke white to make some mistakes. He even succeeded in doing so by changing
the nature of the position but unfortunately couldn't encash on opponents
mistake when it actually came.} Rf8 26. Bh3 $6 (26. Bd7 $1 {simply would not
have allowed the tactics which occurred in the game.} Nf3+ 27. Kh1 Nh4 28. Bh3

move is possible and black will also gain few more tempos due to Ng5} 28. Qxb6

tempting to shatter white's kingside in order to fish for some perpetual but
this was the precise moment where it was possible to launch a concrete attack.}

had two ways to create counter attack but both needed very precise calculation.

geometry here.} (30... f5 {[%csl Rh3][%cal Ge4g5,Gg7g5] I would think this is
very human. As normal play will surely lose why not to just throw everything
on kingside?} 31. Qc7 (31. b5 g5 {at least creats a mess. For what it is worth.
