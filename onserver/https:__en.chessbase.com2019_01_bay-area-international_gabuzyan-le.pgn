Both players have treated the opening very unconventionally. Chances are
roughly level and there hasn't yet been much "enemy contact".} 8. Be2 h6
9. Nd5 Nf6 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {The initiative should now lie rather with
Black. The knight exchange cost White time and he also has more space.}

pawns, but the unsafe king is a burden for White.} 27. Qc7 Rd7 28. Qc8 Qg2
