{Entering this game, Hikaru Nakamura trailed fellow super GM Fabiano Caruana
by a point. After a horrid 2/4 start - including a loss to Caruana in their
direct encounter - the reigning US Champion has been on a rampage, scoring an
impressive 5/6. Xiong, previously undefeated in his first US Championship,
became Nakamura's latest victim.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. f3 {A good decision by
Nakamura and his second, Kris Littlejohn. Why enter the Grunfeld against a
young, solid player who has scored well in the opening? I believe that these 3.
f3 can really help White achieve an out-of-book position quickly, allowing the
stronger player to take charge in the early stages.} Nc6 (3... d5 {is a more
fashionable line, but perhaps Xiong was afraid to venture into this variation
since Nakamura has had a successful history in it, including a smashing win
over Caruana.} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O

Bg7 7. Be2 O-O 8. f4 Ned7 9. Be3 {As Nakamura stated in his interview with
Maurice Ashley, it's not that Black's position is particularly poor here. The
real issue is that White achieves a harmonious setup with ease, whereas Xiong
will find it quite difficult to gain active counterplay. White's path to
improvement is certainly much simpler than Black's.} e6 ({I'm curious if a
move like} 9... Re8 {is an improvement. The essential question is if capturing
on e6 with the rook is better than taking back with the pawn.} 10. Nh3 e6 11.
dxe6 Rxe6 12. Bf3 {looks quite questionable for Black. The e-pawn is not hard
to defend, and White has obtained complete central control with ease. Black
remains cramped and with no pawn breaks in the foreseeable future.}) 10. dxe6 (
10. Nh3 exd5 11. cxd5 Re8 {leads to problems down the e-file for White.}) 10...

novelty, but I'm sure it was played merely because Xiong didn't know what to
do here. The position is already quite difficult.} (15... a6 {didn't help
Black escape Wesley So:} 16. Kh1 Kh8 17. Bc1 Ng8 18. b3 Nh6 19. Bb2 Nf7 20. g3

Vegas 2014}) 16. Ng5 Bh6 (16... h6 17. Nh3 {only creates another weakness,
this time on g6.}) 17. Nb5 (17. h4 {is the move the engines scream for,
probably just to secure the knight's position and prepare an eventual f4-f5
break.}) 17... Bxg5 (17... e5 {was more ambitious and would have given Xiong
more of a puncher's chance. I still much prefer White after} 18. f5 (18. Nxc7 {
gives Black ample counterplay for the lost pawn:} exf4 19. Bxf4 Ne5 20. Nce6
Bxg5 21. Nxg5 h6 (21... Rbc8 {might be a safer method of seeking equality.})
22. Nh3 g5 23. Bxe5 dxe5 {Black may be down a pawn, but White has a long way
to go before that material edge proves enough for victory. It will be
difficult for White to maneuver his minor pieces to their optimal squares
(namely the knight from h3-f2-d1-e3-f5), since the e4 pawn is forever a target.
Certainly an edge for White, but this is a huge improvement over the game
continuation.}) 18... gxf5 19. exf5 Ng4 20. Bxg4 Bxg5 {becomes very complex.
White may gain one of those queenside pawns, but the open g-file and strong
Black center would have provided Xiong good counter chances.}) 18. fxg5 Ne8 19.
Nxa7 $1 {A free pawn is a free pawn, but it does take precision to gobble one
up when the knight appears to be trapped on a7. Nakamura had this calculated
out, though:} Ne5 {This move just doesn't challenge Nakamura at all. Xiong's
position was hovering somewhere in between very unpleasant and horrible,
especially against someone of Nakamura's caliber, but Ne5 is inexplicable. If
I'm being a bit harsh on the talented youngster, it's because I know he's
capable of better. In order to hang with these super elite players, you must
setup obstacles and hope they trip up somewhere along the way. From here on
out, the win became simple.} (19... c6 20. Qb3 {appears to cause White far
less difficulty:} (20. Qa4 Ne5 (20... Ra8 21. Nxc6 Rxa4 (21... Qg7 22. Qb5 Nc7

28. e5 Rd2 29. Bxc6 Rxf1+ 30. Rxf1 Rxb2 {White is two pawns ahead. The ending
isn't completely trivial, but with a few accurate moves the position collapses.
}) 22. Nxe7 Rf7 {appears to trap the knight, but the nice shot} 23. Bd1 {
ends the game immediately.}) 21. Bd4 (21. h4 {also looks very reasonable, but
I'm reluctant to further expand on the kingside.}) (21. Bxb6 c5 {is not what
White is looking for. Black has sacrificed two pawns for tremendous activity,
as White's forces are distracted and stuck on the queenside.}) 21... c5 22.
Bxe5+ dxe5 23. Qb3 Ba8 24. Nb5 Qxg5 25. Rd1 {is a position with equal material,
but the position is anything but equal. White has a clear edge, thanks to the
superior pawn structure and open d-file.}) 20... Ra8 21. Bxb6 c5 22. a4 Qxg5
23. a5 {allows White to escape, unscatched and up a pawn.}) 20. Be2 Rxf1+ 21.
Rxf1 Ra8 22. Nb5 Rxa2 23. Na3 {That rook regains the lost pawn, but
immediately the knight digs its hooves into a3 and entombs it.} Qg7 24. Bd2 Nc6
(24... Rxb2 {was the tactical shot Xiong hoped Nakamura would miss, but
White's last move covers it.} 25. Qxb2 Nf3+ 26. Rxf3 Qxb2 27. Bc3+ {picks up
the queen, with White ahead a full rook.}) 25. Bc3 Nd4 26. Bd3 {Cute. Black
had a cheapo in mind, and Nakamura not only calls, but raises with a better
cheapo of his own.} (26. Qd3 $4 Nxe2+ 27. Qxe2 Qxc3 {would have been tragic.
Amazingly, White is not completely lost here (though he is much worse), but
this would have been a silly blunder.} 28. Rf8+ Kg7 29. Nc2 Qe5 30. Qf1 Nf6 $1
31. Rxf6 Ra8 {and Black is now much better, but White can fight on. Regardless,
this would have been an amateur blunder in a masterfully played game.}) 26...
Kg8 27. Qf2 (27. Qa4 {was also easy, but when you're winning, how you win is
unimportant.}) 27... c5 28. Bb1 Ra1 29. Nc2 Rxb1 (29... Ra8 30. Nxd4 cxd4 31.
Bxd4 e5 32. Bxb6 {allows the rook to survive, but White has a two pawn lead
and a completely dominating position.}) 30. Rxb1 Bxe4 {This would work if not
for...} 31. Nxd4 Bxb1 32. Nf5 $1 {The only winning move, but an elementary one
to spot.} (32. Nxe6 $2 Qf7 {is equal.}) 32... exf5 33. Bxg7 Kxg7 34. Qe3 {
Xiong tips his king, understanding that his b-pawn falls first, then the
h-pawn, then Nakamura can do whatever he pleases en route to victory. This
game can be summed up as smooth sailing for Nakamura, who wisely picked an
opening that limited Xiong's active resources. Xiong can learn a ton from this
encounter with one of the world's top ten players.} 1-0
