{Nakamura has a clear goal in mind, he needs to defend his title at all costs
despite his slow start. Two rounds ago he was 1.5p behind the leaders and only
a devoted fan would have placed him in the title contention. Now he is only
half a point behind and his chances are resurfacing. Never count out the
defending champion!} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. O-O
