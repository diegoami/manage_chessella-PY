15. Rc2 Rad8 {Black has a fine position here. Anand thought for a long time on
how he could wriggle out of the pressure without making positional concessions.
Not finding any way out, he took the bishop on b6 and played f3. While it
looks ugly, it also means that White doesn't have to many things to worry
about.} 16. Nxb6 (16. Re1 {is what Anand wanted to play.} Re6 17. b5 Bxf2+ $1 {
This move casts a doubt on White's entire play.} (17... Rh6 18. h4 g5 19. bxc6
gxh4 20. Bxe5 $18 {White wins as he gets the bishop to protect all the squares
around his king.}) 18. Kxf2 Qxh2 {And even though White king can run to the
queenside it all looks really bad.} 19. Rg1 Rf6+ 20. Ke3 Qh6+ $1 $19 {Game
over.}) 16... cxb6 17. f3 {Anand wasn't too happy to make this move, but with
this he no longer has to worry about the pressure on the e2 pawn.} Be6 18. Qd2
b5 (18... Nd4 19. Bxd4 exd4 $15 {would have been the best way for Caruana to
play.}) 19. f4 Bg4 $2 {[%cal Ge6g4] This is the start of Anand's combination.
He had seen many times that Bg4 was not possible, but still Fabiano had played
it. Rather than doubting himself, Anand went ahead with what he had calculated.
} 20. Bxc6 $1 bxc6 21. fxe5 {So White is a pawn up. What did Black under his
sleeve? Well Fabiano once again surprised Anand with the move that the latter
had thought was impossible.} f6 $2 {[%cal Gf7f6] This is a clear mistake, but
when you have said A (Bg4), you must say B.} 22. exf6 $1 Rxe2 {[%cal Ge8e2] It
looks like mate, just that it isn't.} 23. f7+ Kf8 {[%cal Gc3g7]} 24. Bxg7+ Kxg7
25. Qc3+ Re5 {[%cal Ge2e5] Fabi went ahead with this move as he had not seen
Anand's next move.} (25... Qe5 {was the best defense for Black.} 26. Rxe2 Qxc3

30. Rfxf8 Rxd3 31. Rg8+ Kf7 32. Ref8+ (32. Rd8 Bd7 $1 {This is the move that
Caruana had missed and the reason why he didn't play this variation.}) 32...
Ke7 33. Ra8 h5 34. Rxa7+ Ke6 $16 {And according to Anand, he was not even sure
if he was winning here. "The technical task is just too huge", said Vishy. If
the bishop gets to d5, Black would not even be worse. Objectively speaking
White is better here, but the win is not so clear.}) 26. Qd4 $3 {[%cal Gc3d4]
A brilliant move. As Anand said, this is easy to miss. It changes nothing as
the rook on e5 is still pinned. The main idea is to vacate the c5 square for
the rook.} (26. h3 {was what Fabiano had calculated} Bd1 {was the American
player's idea. It's at least a mess, Fabiano thought.} (26... Bxh3 27. Rh2
{White is winning here.})) 26... Qg5 27. Rc5 $1 {[%cal Gc2c5]} Rxd4 {Fabiano
allows White to queen. By now he had realized that it was all over.} (27...

win by Anand which will surely make it to his best games collection in the
future.} 1-0
