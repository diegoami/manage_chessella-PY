{This was by far the most interesting game of round five. Caruana really showed
what a braveheart he was by employing the Benoni. Although Aronian was just too
optimistic about his position, it surely looked dangerous for Black. The game
ended in a draw, but there was a lot of excitement.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3
c5 $5 {As the commentator Miroshnichenko said, "Not the Berlin but the Benoni!"
Same two letters at the start but completely different games!} 4. d5 d6 5. Nc3
exd5 6. cxd5 g6 7. e4 Bg7 8. Be2 {Aronian chooses the classical setup of the
good olden days with Be2, Nd2, Qc2 etc. Much more modern and aggressive is Bd3
followed by h3. But once you play something modern, it becomes theoretical,
while with Be2 there quite some scope for creativity.} O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Nd2
Nbd7 11. Qc2 (11. a4 {was how one of the greatest defensive player in the
world, Tigran Petrosian, liked to play. The move itself is a high class
prophylactic move. It stops ideas of b5 and at the same time prepares a highly
sophisticated manoeuvre with Ra3 so that the rook can help in the kingside
defense!}) 11... Ne5 12. b3 $5 {Caruana said in the interview after the game
that he had looked at this move and it seemed dangerous to say the least.} Bg4
13. Bxg4 (13. f3 {was possible but Aronian saw absolutely no need for this.})
13... Nfxg4 14. Bb2 a6 15. h3 Nf6 16. f4 {Optically it seems that White is
simply cruising. He has developed all of his pieces and has a nice central pawn
majority, Nc4 is coming, so is Rae1 and e5 is well and truly on cards.} Ned7
17. Nc4 (17. a4 {Trying to play it slow was also an option.}) 17... Nb6 18.

Fabiano's intention, but he didn't go with it.} 20. g4 (20. e5 dxe5 21. f5 Ng3

equal because Black can strike out with} b5 $1 $132) 20. e5 $1 { [#] A textbook
positional idea which I explained in quite some detail in my DVD "Learn from
the Classics". The point is very nice: if White played direct f5 then the e5
square would be a huge hole. However, by playing e5 dxe5 and then f5, the e5
square is covered by a pawn, the bishop on g7 is passive, all in all it is an
excellent positional pawn sacrifice. It has been played in many classical
games, one of them being Botvinnik-Pomar.} dxe5 21. f5 $1 b5 $1 {Caruana
realises that he needs to be active. Just sitting and doing nothing would lead
to a mate pretty soon.} (21... e4 22. Nxe4 $16) 22. Ne4 Nb6 23. Bc1 (23. f6
{was Aronian's intuition. He wanted to launch a very strong attack on the Black
king. Look at his idea.} Bf8 24. h4 $3 {[#] I wonder how such ideas even come
to these top players. In this position he wants to play h5 then take on g6 and
after hxg6 by Black transfer his queen to h4 followed by Ng5 and deliver mate.
Of course this takes a lot of time but it is interesting nonetheless.} Nxc4 25.
h5 Qxd5 {This looks like the most critical way as Black has won two pawns.}

back on g6 with the f-pawn. The engines immediately show how White can gain a
decisive advantage.} 26. Qf2 $1 Qxd5 27. hxg6 fxg6 28. Rd1 Qf7 (28... Qxe4 29.

30. Re3 $1 $18 {and the mate on the h-file cannot be averted. Wasn't this a
simply amazing bit of analysis by Aronian? Creativity, calculation, intuition,
art and beauty all rolled into one. Only thing lacking during the game for
Aronian was trust - the trust on his intuition!}) 23... Nxc4 24. d6 gxf5 (24...

Black has it under control with} Qa5 $1 {attacking the e1 rook.} (26... Qd7 27.

after} 29. Qf2 $1 $40 {it seems like White should have a strong attack.}) 27.

And all thanks to Caruana who had the bravery to play the Benoni!} 1/2-1/2
