36... Qxb4 {Not a double attack, but a *triple* attack with pawn, bishop and
rook all under fire by the queen. What to do?} 37. Re4 {Not worry!} c5 ({ It is
not hard to see the bishop cannot be captured since} 37... Qxc4 38. b7 { and
the pawn, supported by the queen on f4, cannot be stopped.}) (37... Qxb6 { can
be a little trickier to refute.} 38. Re7 $3 {is the killer blow. f7 is under
attack and Black cannot defend against Rxf7 except with} Bxe7 {after which all
is lost.} 39. Qxf7+ Kh6 40. Qxe7 {Black's king is caught in a fatal web. The
immediate threat is Qf8+ followed by mate so} Qb8 {is more or less forced.
White could already win the knight with Qe3+ but there are much more attractive
targets available.} 41. Bf7 $1 {The threat is Qf6 after which g6 and mate
cannot be stopped, therefore} Qh8 {is the only move that can prevent it.} 42.
Qg5+ Kg7 43. Qe5+ {and ther queen falls since} Kh7 44. Bxg6+ Kg8 45. Qe8+ Kg7
46. Qf7+ Kh6 47. Be4 {leads to mate.}) 38. Qd6 Qxc4 39. b7 Qb3 40. b8=Q Qf3+
