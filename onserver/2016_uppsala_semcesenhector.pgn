1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Qc2 dxc4 5. e4 b5 6. b3 cxb3 7. axb3 {This is
a brilliant concept. White is trusting his centre, some lines and diagonals.
Black is allowed to try out a wide range of defences.} e6 8. Bd2 (8. Bd3 Bb4+
9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Qxd2 {in order to attack the Black squares later on is also
possible. But Bd2 on the other hand keeps all pieces on the board which in
some moves will mean that the Black pieces will get irritated in each others.})
8... a5 (8... Bb7 9. Ba5 {is not the end of the world, but little bit annoying.
}) 9. Bd3 Be7 10. O-O Bb7 11. Rd1 (11. Rc1 {With a restraied strategy has been
played, but Rd1 seems more to the point.}) 11... Qb6 12. h3 {A waiting move.
White wants Black to go to d7 with the knight before playing Nc3 himself.
That's cool, not forcing anything despite being a pawn down.} (12. Nc3 Na6)
12... Nbd7 13. Nc3 g6 $6 (13... h6 {and then 0-0 in an appropriate moment was
mandatory.}) 14. Bh6 $1 {Right in the face.} Rc8 15. Qe2 b4 $6 {It looks like
Black has lost interest in the game, just pushing woods.} ({This bitter pill
should not be delayed further.} 15... Bf8) 16. Na4 Qc7 17. Rac1 Bf8 18. Qe3 {
White thanks the pawn on h3!} Ng8 {Black was hopeless anyway.} 19. Bxf8 Kxf8
20. d5 {A classic.} exd5 21. exd5 c5 22. Bb5 {Daniel is merciless.} Ngf6 23. d6
Qd8 24. Nxc5 Rxc5 25. Rxc5 Bxf3 26. gxf3 Nxc5 27. Qxc5 Kg7 28. Qe5 Rf8 29. d7
Kg8 30. Rd6 Nh5 31. Rc6 Qa8 32. Qc5 Nf4 33. Rc8 {A strategic masterpice by
Semsecen, the Champion from 2014!} 1-0
