{This game was taking place on the board right next to me, so I thoroughly
enjoyed seeing the battle.} 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Ng5
Ngf6 6. Bd3 Qc7 $5 (6... e6 {is the more common response.}) 7. N1f3 h6 8. Ne6
$5 {At first I thought that the white player had messed up the move orders in
his mind and made this losing move. But it turns out that almost nine games
have continued in his fashion and White has decent compensation.} fxe6 9. Bg6+
Kd8 {One of the reasons why I thought that White had blundered was because he
went into a long think at this point. Finally he decided to simply develop his
pieces.} 10. O-O {White's main compensation lies in the fact that Black is
throughly unco-ordinated and it will take a long time for the bishop on f8 to
come into the game.} b6 11. Qe2 c5 12. Ne5 $5 {I liked this decision very much.
You have to take this knight as Nf7+ is a huge threat.} Nxe5 13. dxe5 {This is
a highly interesting structure. The bishop on g6 takes care of the g7 pawn and
the pawn on e5 takes care of the e6 and the e7 pawn. It means that the bishop
on f8 will be trapped forever! Yes, that would be the case if White had a pawn
on h5 but here Black can at the right moment play h5 and get his rook to h6
and hope to activate his pieces.} Nd7 14. Rd1 Bb7 15. Bf4 c4 16. Rd4 {By this
point White player was extremely confident and making his moves with great
pleasure. Why shouldn't he! He is not a piece down, rather a rook up!} Bd5 17.
Rad1 Qc6 18. f3 $2 (18. Bf7 $1 $18 {With the idea of Rxd5 followed by Bxd5
would have ended the game.}) 18... b5 $1 {Now that the knight is coming to b6,
not many tactics are going to work here.} 19. h4 h5 $1 {Forced. Now the rook
will come to h6 to attack the bishop on g6 and after Bxh6 gxh6, the f8 bishop
will finally get to see daylight on g7.} (19... Nb6 {is a move that is
recommended by the computer but I doubt what it would do after} 20. h5 $18 {
Sealing the entire kingside. These are some kind of positions which it seems
like the engines cannot understand as yet.}) 20. Kh2 (20. b3 {Opening the
position immediately was necessary.}) 20... Kc8 21. Qf2 Nb6 22. Bg5 Rh6 $1 23.
Bxh6 gxh6 {Because of the secure centre, the advantage is with Black because
she has two pieces for a rook.} 24. Qg3 Bg7 25. Be8 Bxe5 26. Qxe5 Qxe8 27. Qg7
Kd7 28. Qxh6 Qh8 29. Qe3 Rf8 {All of Black pieces have started to work to
perfection and the game ends in a few moves.} 30. b3 Qg7 31. Qf2 Ke8 32. a4
cxb3 33. cxb3 Bxb3 34. Re1 bxa4 35. Rde4 Bd5 36. Re5 Qh6 37. Qe2 Qf4+ 38. Kg1
Qd4+ 39. Qf2 Qxf2+ 40. Kxf2 Rh8 41. f4 a3 42. f5 Rf8 43. g4 Nc4 44. R5e2 hxg4
45. Kg3 Rxf5 46. Ra1 Kf7 47. Rh2 Kg6 {I liked this topsy turvy battle of
material imbalances where understanding quality of pieces was extremely
important and the positions were not so easy to assess.} 0-1
