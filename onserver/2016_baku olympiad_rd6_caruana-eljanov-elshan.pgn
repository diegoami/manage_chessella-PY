{In one of the crucial matches in round six, or probably the entire tournament,
the US team narrowly edged the strong Ukrainian team 2.5-1.5 to clinch clear
second on the leaderboard. The US team has never been in danger in any of
their matches ( well a bit against the Czech maybe) and their "big three" have
consistently scored. This time Caruana won with very fine technique on board
one against Eljanov.} 1. e4 {(0s)} c5 {(0s)} 2. Nf3 {(0s)} Nc6 {(0s)} 3. Bb5 {
(0s) This is not an unusual choice by Fabiano. He has employed the "Rossolimo"
in the past in a handful of games.} g6 {(0s)} 4. Bxc6 {(24s)} bxc6 {(0s) This
came as a surprise to me. dxc6 is considered the solid continuation here.
Eljanov's immediate reply implies that he had this line thoroughly
investigated or maybe he was just afraid of Caruana's strength in handling
"main line" like this game which took place in the very same country a few
months earlier.} (4... dxc6 5. d3 Bg7 6. h3 Nf6 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Bf4 b6 9. Qd2 Re8

Bg7 {(22s)} 6. Re1 {(19s)} Nh6 {(47s) Well, recent results in this line have
been very promising for Black. Results among Top GMs in 2016 show that Black
is actually doing very well in this line. So, probably we are witnessing a
shift in fashion of how to handle the "Rossolimo" with Black.} 7. c3 {(34s)}

games.} 8. h3 {(42s) less common than} (8. d4) 8... f5 {(17s)} (8... f6 {
used to be the way people handled this position. Black prevents e5 and plans
to retreat his badly placed knight on h6 to f7. Black hopes to create a pawn
mass in the center while his queenside is somewhat weakened and his pieces are
a bit crammed. That is what I knew from from my past experience with this
position. Eljanov, however, has a more radical approach to solve his opening
"issues".}) (8... d5 {Is another way, which Gelfand employed against Inarkiev

somewhat deep thought, Caruana decides to keep things simple.} Bxc4 {(1244s)}
13. dxc4 {(5s) Judgment time: The opening phase is over and now the game is
entering the middle game phase. White has more space and both sides' pawn
structure is a bit funky. Black's main plan will be to put pressure on e5
otherwise White's excessive space could become a decisive factor in this game.}

have given Black a lot of activity which probably would have secured equality
for Black.}) 31. Qxe4 {(37s) Judgement time 2: We are entering the endgame
phase in this game. The last exchange gave White a lot of play as his queen is
very nicely placed in the center and it will soon target black king while
having an eye on his far passed pawn on the a-file. White also controls the
b-file which makes his rook more active than Back's rook. The main advantage
of White is that his heavy pieces are capable of combining both attack and
defence while black pieces are only in defensive situation. Evaluation? White
is better!} Qc7 {(266s)} 32. c5 $1 {(342s) Of course!} dxc5 {(105s)} 33. Qc4+ {

but now mate is unavoidable. A neat demonstration of simple chess by Fabiano
Caruana. In the 1920s the US had a famous grandmaster, Isaac Kashdan, who was
considered by many, including the 4th world champion Alexander Alekhine, as
one of the main contenders for the world champion title. Kashdan's nickname
was 'der Kleine Capablanca' ( German for "The little Capablanca") for his
talent in grinding wins out of even positions. Since Fabiano's performance was
better and beyond, I would like to call him 'Der gro√üe Capablanca' !!!!} 1-0
