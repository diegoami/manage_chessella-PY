O-O 9. h3 Bb7 10. d4 Re8 11. Ng5 Rf8 12. Nf3 Re8 13. Nbd2 exd4 14. cxd4 Nd7 15.
Nf1 Na5 16. Bc2 Bf6 17. N1h2 c5 18. d5 Nc4 19. Rb1 {Still theory. Black will
play on the queenside, White will play on the kingside. Black's attack is
usually quicker but White's attack is more dangerous. All in all chances are
equal.} Nde5 {The first new move.} 20. Nxe5 Bxe5 21. b3 Nb6 22. Ng4 Bd4 23. Be3
Bc3 24. Re2 b4 {To advance with the a-pawn and open the a-file. But how should
White proceed with his attack?} 25. Bf4 $1 {Regrouping his pieces to bring the
rook to the g-file.} a5 26. Re3 Bc8 {Wanting to exchange one attacking piece.}
27. Rg3 Bxg4 28. hxg4 $5 {This seems paradoxical at first. Why does White
bring his rook to g3 if he now blocks its view? But White does not want to
attack on the g- but on the h-file.} a4 29. g5 axb3 30. axb3 g6 31. Be3 c4 32.
Rh3 {White needs more time than Black to create concrete threats. However, he
wants to mate, Black "only" wants to win material.} Ra2 ({Black also needs to
find a way to create concrete threats. 32...Ra2 looks natural but maybe it was
better to play} 32... cxb3 33. Rxb3 Nc4 {After for instance} 34. Bf4 (34. Bd4
Ra1 35. Bb1 Qxg5 36. Rbxc3 bxc3 37. Bxc3 Ra3 $17) 34... Ra1 35. Rb1 Rxb1 36.
Bxb1 Qb6 {Black's position looks promising. White's attack seems to be less
dangerous than Black's b-pawn.}) 33. g3 $1 {Remarkably cold-blooded. Black's
rook entered White's position but White takes his time to create potential
threats on the h-file.} Qc7 34. Kg2 Rea8 35. Rc1 Rb2 ({Again a natural move
but the engines prefer} 35... Ra1 {e.g.} 36. Bb1 cxb3 37. Qxb3 (37. Rxh7 Kxh7
38. Qh1+ Kg8 39. Bd4 Bxd4 40. Rxc7 b2 41. Rc6 Rxb1 42. Qxb1 Ra1 $19) 37... Qc4
38. Qc2 Nd7 {and Black's threats are more real.}) 36. Bd4 f6 37. gxf6 Bxd4 38.
Qxd4 Raa2 {[#] Threatening 39... cxb3. But White now wins with a surprising
combination:} 39. Rxh7 $3 Qxh7 (39... Kxh7 40. Rh1+ Kg8 41. f7+ Kxf7 42. Rh7+
Ke8 43. Qh8#) 40. Qxb6 {After this right-left combination White is an exchange
down, his bishop on c2 is hanging and the pawn on f6 looks vulnerable. However,
Black's king is exposed - too exposed.} Qf7 (40... Rxc2 $2 41. Qd8+ Kf7 42.
Qe7+ Kg8 43. Qe8#) 41. Rh1 Ra8 ({After} 41... Qxf6 {White wins with} 42. Qb8+
Qf8 43. Rh8+ Kxh8 44. Qxf8+ Kh7 45. Qf7+ Kh8 46. e5 $18) 42. Bd1 Qxf6 43. Bg4
Re8 ({After the surprising counter-sacrifice} 43... Qxf2+ 44. Qxf2 Raa2 45.
Qxb2 Rxb2+ 46. Kf3 Rxb3+ 47. Kf4 Kg7 48. e5 dxe5+ 49. Kxe5 {the white bishop
and the d-pawn are too strong. White is winning.}) 44. Qa7 {Threatening 45.
Be6+ Kf8 46.Rh8+ Qxh8 47. Qf7#} Qe5 45. Rh7 Rxf2+ {The only way to avoid being
mated.} 46. Kxf2 Rf8+ 47. Kg2 Qxe4+ 48. Kh2 Rf2+ 49. Qxf2 Kxh7 50. Qf7+ Kh8 51.

Yi.} 1-0
