{This was Bernadskiy's favourite game from the tournament.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6
3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 Na5 {If you can win the important bishop, why not?!} 5. Nge2
Nxc4 6. dxc4 c6 7. O-O Be7 8. b3 O-O 9. a4 a5 10. Ng3 Bb4 11. Qf3 d6 12. Bg5 h6
$6 (12... Bg4 {was an interesting move.} 13. Bxf6 (13. Qe3 h6 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 $15
{gives Black a clear edge.}) (13. Qd3 {is relatively the best allowing the
bishop to retreat when attacked with h6.}) 13... Bxf3 14. Bxd8 Bxc3 {Two
bishops hanging, one white rook on a1. What exactly is going on? Well, Black is
better here.} 15. Be7 Rfe8 16. Bxd6 Bxa1 17. Rxa1 Bg4 18. f3 Be6 $15) 13. Bxf6
Qxf6 14. Qxf6 gxf6 15. Nd1 $1 {The f5 square is juicy and the knights turn
their attention to those squares. The bishops are pretty useless in this
position.} Kh7 (15... Bc5 {stopping Ne3 doesn't work as after} 16. Ne3 Bxe3 17.
fxe3 $16 {Black loses the f6 pawn.}) 16. Ne3 Be6 17. Rad1 Rad8 18. Rd3 Rd7 19.
f4 $1 {Typical play. The weakness on d6 has been created. It's now time to
attack on another front.} exf4 20. Rxf4 Kg6 21. Ngf5 $6 (21. Nef5 {was more
accurate, because it keeps the option of the other knight going to h5.} h5 22.
Nxh5 $1 Bxf5 (22... Kxh5 23. Rh4+ Kg6 24. Rg3#) 23. Rxf5 $18) 21... Bc5 22. Kf1
Re8 (22... Bxe3 {It would have been better to eliminate this knight. Maria had
not seen her opponent's next move.}) 23. Nd5 $1 {A very strong move. It opens
the third rank for the d3 rook and launches a mating attack against the black
king.} cxd5 (23... Bxd5 24. Rg3+ Kh7 25. Rh4 $18) 24. Rg3+ Kh7 25. Nxh6 $1 {
Credit must be given to Bernadskiy for believing in his attack. It's true that
Black has the move and the extra piece, but he is simply helpless against the
white rook moving to the h-file and delivering the mate.} (25. Rg7+ Kh8 $19 {
is just winning for Black.}) 25... Be3 {The only defence.} (25... dxe4 26. Rh4
$18) 26. Rxe3 Kxh6 27. Rg3 $1 {Once again the rook cuts the king off and
threatens Rh4#.} Kh5 28. cxd5 {The bishop is trapped on e6.} Bxd5 29. Rf5+ Kh4
30. Rg7 $1 {Very clinical. The threat is g3 followed by Rh5#} Re5 31. g3+ Kh3
32. Rh7+ {An excellent game by the young Ukrainian.} (32. Rh7+ Kg4 33. Rh4#)
