Daniel King was very excited in the commentary room. When Grischuk came to the
post game conference Daniel praised him by saying, "You played like a man
against the Najdorf!" Grischuk then told the audience an interesting story
which went, "In 1993 when Nigel Short was preparing for his World Championship
Match against Kasparov one of his fan wrote to him saying that he had refuted
the Najdorf and he was ready share the fruits of his hard work with Nigel. The
move that he recommended for White was 6.g4! The player went on to analyze 6...
e6, 6...e5, 6...b5 etc. in great depths and finally in the end he wrote 6...
Bxg4 7.f3 with good compensation!" Everyone had a hearty laugh in the
commentary room hearing this anecdote.} e6 7. f4 h6 8. Bh4 Qb6 9. a3 Be7 (9...

should Black play?} d5 $1 {One of the reasons why Najdorf is favoured by so
many great players is because of the many exceptions to the rules. Common logic
says that Black mustn't open the position because his king is in the center.
However, more than general stuff it is the specifics that are more important.
The queen and the rook on h1 are on the same diagonal as the bishop on b7, and
it makes sense to break here with d5!} 15. e5 (15. exd5 Nxd4 $1 16. Bxd4 Nxd5
