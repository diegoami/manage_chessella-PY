However, none of the players suspected that it would be the c5-pawn the one that twenty moves later would decide the game in White's favor.} N6d7 7. Be2 e6 8. Qb3 b6 ({Maybe} 8... Qc8 {was better.} )9. 0-0 Be7 10. Rd1 0-0 11. Nc3 c6 (11... Nc6 $2 {
would have been followed by} 12. Qa4 {and proven pointless.} )12. Bf4 Nf6 13. Rac1 {[#]} b5 ({After} 13... Nbd7 {Black's position would probably still be
defensible.} )14. a4 a6 15. Qa3 Nd5 ({In case of} 15... Nbd7 16. Ne5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Nd5 18. Nxd5 {it would have immediately evident how dangerous the white pressure on the black position was.} )16.

[#] White is much better at this early stage. He has more space and can develop his pieces harmoniously.} a5 (8... c5 {Maybe this is better, but even here White has an advantage.} )9. Bxf5 exf5 10. Bg5 f6 {Without this move Black would hardly be able to continue.} 11. Bf4 Be6 (11... 0-0 {was not completely outlandish. White no longer has a light-squared bishop, so he cannot easily attack the black structure on the kingside.} )12. Nh3 Nd7 13. 0-0 Nf8 14. Re1 {
[#] White is virtually winning - he is fully developed and can
hit on f6 at any time to open the position, while the black king is hopelessly stuck in the centre.} Qd7 15. Qe2 Bg8 (15... 0-0-0 $4 16. Qa6+ Kb8 17. exf6 {with Dxb6+ later.} )16. Qd3 Ng6 17.
