Qb3 a5 9. Rd1 Re8 10. d3 h6 11. Bg2 {[#] A normal person would play d6 in this
position but not a creative genius like Igor Kovalenko.} Ra6 $1 {A very
interesting rook lift.} 12. h3 {I don't quite understand if there was a need to
weaken the kingside with h3, but Aronian wanted to develop his bishop on e3
without Ng4 bothering him.} Rae6 13. Be3 d6 14. Na4 b6 15. a3 Bc5 16. Bd2 Nh5 {
The bishop on c5, knight on h5, rook on e6, bishop on c8 and queen on d8 all
are ready to get into the attack. It makes sense to get rid of the c5 bishop.}
17. Nxc5 dxc5 18. Bf3 Nf6 (18... Nxg3 19. fxg3 Rg6 20. Kh2 $18 {repels the
attack.}) ({But it is surprising that Igor Kovalenko missed this move.} 18...
Nf4 $1 19. gxf4 Rg6+ 20. Kh2 Qh4 $19) 19. Qc2 Qe7 20. Bg2 e4 21. Re1 $2 {[#]} (
21. dxe4 Nxe4 22. Be1 {was relatively safer.}) 21... e3 $1 22. Bc1 (22. Bxe3
Rxe3 23. fxe3 Qxe3+ 24. Kh2 Nh5 $19 {The problems of playing h3 now become
apparent, with g3 is just too weak to fend for itself.}) 22... Nh5 23. Rf1
exf2+ 24. Rxf2 Nxg3 {Black has compensation for his extra pawn.} 25. e4 Rg6 26.
Qd1 f5 $1 27. exf5 Nxf5 28. Kh2 Qh4 29. Qf3 Bb7 30. Qxb7 Qxf2 {An inspired game
by Igor Kovalenko.} 0-1
