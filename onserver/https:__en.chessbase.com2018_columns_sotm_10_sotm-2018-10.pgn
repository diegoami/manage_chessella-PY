{In this position, White is to move and win. He has a consistent plan: Keep on
attacking the bishops until one can be conquered. However, the attacks must be
done correctly. This study, as part of the classical heritage, was reprinted a
few times and is known under study enthusiasts, but also very instructive, and
likely not known to a wide circle of players. So it is worth reproducing here,
although the practical use will be limited. The first move is dictated by
having to parry the threat of 1.-Bc5+ when Black can coordinate his pieces.
The endgame of rook and bishop versus two bishops is drawn.} 1. Bf2 $1 Be6 $1 {
Black must defend g8, and such small weaknesses in his positions are enough
for White to win under threat of entering the eighth rank on a different line.}

being the other threat.}) ({The a- and b-file is poisoned:} 2... Bb3 3. Ra6+

he has to choose a bad square.} Bb4 (8... Be7 9. Rd7) 9. Rd4 ({Here also} 9.
Rd1 Bc3 10. Rc1 {is winning, as White can attack the bishop again on the
c-file and then switch to the a-file to win Ba2. This however is a loss of
time dual, which does not destroy the study.}) 9... Be7 10. Ra4+ Kb8 11. Rxa2

is, with the exception of 5.Ke7, not extraordinary, but the ending can give a

{The final study is more of a directmate problem that would have had ugly side
variations if published as such. White is to move and win. As a directmate, it
would have to be rendered as mate in six, but the thematic variations are all
only four or five moves long, thus the publication as study. The same idea - a
Novotny, as it is called in problem terms - of obstructing the bishop and rook
line with a sacrifice is shown three times on the three different files d, e,
and f. All given variations are main variations.} 1. Kd8 Bb4 (1... Re3 2. Ke8

{The final checkmate in three moves shows the slight asymmetry in an almost
symmetric position. The key can also be seen logically, but the problem does
not belong to the Logical or Neudeutsche school because of it. 1.Qg5+ fails to
1.-K:c4, but after 1.-b:c3 or 1.-d:c3 this move works. The move 1.Qc1 can't
however be seen as a strict logical foreplan, rather this theme is accidental.
