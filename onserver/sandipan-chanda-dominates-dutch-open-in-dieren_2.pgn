1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3
dxc4 5. e4 Bb4 6. Bg5 (6. Bxc4 {is another sharp line in the Vienna.})
6... c5 7. Bxc4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bxc3+ (8... Qa5 { is also possible but it
gives White an option to come back with Bd2.}) 9. bxc3 Qa5 10. Bb5+ Bd7
11. Bxf6 gxf6 (11... Qxc3+ 12. Kf1 gxf6 13. Rc1 $18 {followed by Rc8 finishes
off the game.}) 12. Bxd7+ Nxd7 13. O-O {This line is very interesting.
White has his king safely tucked in on g1. But is it really safe? The
g-file is open and there are chances of launching an attack. At the same
time, the black king cannot castle long or short but on e7 it is not so
badly placed. All in all it boils down to whether White can make use of
Black's king position. Because statically Black's pawn structure is better.}
a6 14. Rb1 Qc7 15. Qh5 Nc5 {We see one more advantage of Black's setup.
The knight on c5 cannot be dislodged so easily.} (15... Ke7 {looks natural
but White can just go } 16. f4 $1 {and with e5 coming up it will open
up the position in the centre.} ) 16. Rb4 Qe5 {Black would be more than
happy to exchange queens.} 17. Qh6 { Keeping the queens on.} Qg5 18. Qh3
Rg8 19. g3 b5 (19... Nxe4 20. Nxe6 $1 $18) 20. Qxh7 {White snaps up a
pawn, but Black isn't too worried about it. He has his pieces in good
position.} Nd3 (20... Rc8 $1 $132) 21. Nf3 (21. Rbb1 Rg7 22. Qh3 Nf4 23.
Qh8+ Rg8 24. Qh7 Rg7 {and Black has at least a draw here.}) 21... Qg4
22. h3 Qg7 {The queens will come off now, but White is a pawn up and Black
is not so well co-ordinated.} 23. Qxg7 Rxg7 24. Rd4 Nf4 25. Kh2 Ne2 26.
Rd3 Rc8 27. a3 $1 {A very nice move. The idea is to prevent Nxc3 followed
by b5-b4.} a5 (27... Nxc3 {is impossible due to} 28. Rc1 $18) (27... Rxc3
{is possible but not so great as after} 28. Rfd1 {a mate in two is threatened
on d8 and after} Rxd3 29. Rxd3 e5 30. Rd6 {White will be up a pawn and
clearly pushing.}) 28. c4 $1 {Khenkin is on fire. In a position that could
very well peter out into a draw he keeps finding resources that make his
opponent's task as difficult as possible.} Rxc4 (28... bxc4 29. Re3 $18)
29. Rfd1 {Threatening a mate} Rc7 $2 ( 29... Rc8 {was preferable. And
at this point we could say that Black is still in the game.}) 30. R1d2
Nc3 $2 (30... Nc1 31. Rd8+ Ke7 32. Rb8 $16 {was the lesser evil but still
pretty bad for Black.}) 31. Nd4 $1 {A powerful move. Can you see the threat?
Csaba couldn't and that's why he took the e4 pawn.} Nxe4 { [%tqu "How
to finish off the game?","","",Nc6,"",10,Nxb5,"Why go for a pawn when
you can win the game?",0]} 32. Nc6 $1 {A powerful blow. There is absolutely
no way to prevent mate. Look how the rook on g7 prevents the king to escape
from f8-g7. A great game by Igor Khenkin.} (32. Nxb5 {Why go for a pawn
when you can win the game?}) 1-0
