{Dmitry Svetushkin is known for his creative attacking chess and this fragment
is the perfect example.} 23. e6 Qg6+ 24. Kh1 Nd4 ({Can Black play} 24... Qg4 {
? It seems so!} 25. Rg1 Qxh3 26. Rxg7+ Kh8 {And although White does win back
the queen with} 27. Rg3+ {after} Bf6 28. Bxf6+ Rxf6 29. Rxh3 Rfxe6 {the
position is about equal.}) 25. Rg1 Qf6 26. Qg2 Bd6 {Black seems to have managed
to organize some sort of defence but the Moldavian GM has an ace up his
sleeve...} 27. c3 $1 Nxe6 28. Nxd6 cxd6 29. Rxe6 $3 Rxe6 30. c4 {The point! The
monster on b2 has come alive.} Qg6 31. Qb7 Rf7 32. Qa8+ Rf8 33. Qxa7 Rfe8 ({and
Black resigned, not waiting for 34.Rxg6. A better try was} 33... Rf7 34. Qa8+
Rf8 35. Qd5 {and Black will have to give up heavy material. Despite this loss,
the Italian GM kept calm and played good chess, finishing the tournament on a
positive note: third place!}) 1-0
