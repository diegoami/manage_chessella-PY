{Salento and its tournament are known to provide a variety of side-activities,
chess or non chess related, to cover a wide range of tastes and create a
congenial atmosphere to work in. Quite often the evenings were spent together
outdoors (over a beer or two), when chess players would analyze their games,
or indoors by joining the lessons offered by several GM's. Very much to the
public's delicacy, the 5th Salento Open got off to a flying start thanks to an
entertaining lecture by the top rated player in the event, who turned out to
be also the over all winner!} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c3 d5 4. e5 d4 5. Bd3 Nc6
6. O-O Nge7 7. Re1 Ng6 8. c4 Be7 9. Bxg6 hxg6 10. d3 g5 $1 {What impressed the
entire audience in Salento, so not just your auhtor, was that an almost
flawless game, full with creative ideas, was executed by an...11 y.o. boy?!
Seeing Andriy's rating now seems like a 'normal' course of events but back
then, most probably Buturin was not as pleased as we were in Italy. And btw:
so small but already quite offensive!} 11. h3 f6 {The now mature and
experienced Andriy recognized the unnecessary loss of tempo, as f5 could have
been played at once, without allowing White developing the knight to d2. And
yet, it doesn't change the fact that Black is simply better, in spite of the
'insecure' black king who is optically speaking endangered but in fact enjoys
quite a healthy life right in the middle of the board.} 12. Nbd2 f5 13. Nf1 {
Now White's plan is the bold but quite effective Qd2, followed by the pawn's
capture on g5...so how should Black react?} Kf7 $1 {fearless!} (13... O-O {
is also possible but the principled Ukrainian thought why would he allow} 14.
Qd2 f4 {[%cal Gf1h2,Gh2g4] giving all these squares away for nothing? Black is
still doing great as the c8-bishop can be developed in true French or Dutch
style, via d7-g6-h5 but I actually liked even more the game's continuation.})
14. a3 (14. Qd2 {was planned to be met with} Kg6 $1 {Turns out the king is a
dangerous piece in the middlegame as well, not only in the endgame!}) 14... Kg6
{played anyway, as prophylaxis is quite a good piece of advice in chess.} 15.
Bd2 a5 16. b3 {So how to continue...} b6 $1 {All the pieces should join the
party. Once again, age is sometimes just a number... accurate chess is not
reserved only for the elite but...perhaps talent and hard work has a say in it
too.} 17. N3h2 Bb7 18. f4 gxf4 19. Bxf4 {The next move made me smile again:}
Kf7 $1 {The king is used just like any other piece!} 20. Ra2 g5 21. Bc1 Qc7 ({
Perhaps even better would have been} 21... Qg8 {[%cal Gg8g6,Ga8g8] making all
the pieces active.}) 22. Rf2 Rag8 23. Ng4 Kg6 24. Qe2 Nd8 25. Ngh2 Nf7 26. Nd2
Rh7 27. Ndf3 Rgh8 ({In a way, pity} 27... Kg7 {[%cal Gg7h8] was not played,
when the black king would have found the perfect shelter after such a hectic
life:) But the Ukrainian had no time for such trivial thoughts as the attack
was by far more tempting...}) 28. Ref1 Qc6 29. Qe1 g4 30. hxg4 fxg4 31. Nxd4
cxd4 (31... Rxh2 {was more accurate as} 32. Rf6+ Bxf6 33. Rxf6+ Kg7 34. Nxc6 {
is not working} Rh1+ 35. Kf2 Rxe1 36. Kxe1 Bxc6) 32. Rf6+ ({With fresh
computer eyes} 32. Qe2 {is the best defense but probably at the end of the day
Black will bring home the point. True, after some efforts involved.} Rh4 33.
Rxf7 g3 34. Rxe7 gxh2+ 35. Kh1 Qxg2+ 36. Qxg2+ Bxg2+ 37. Kxg2 h1=Q+ 38. Rxh1
Rxh1 39. Bf4 Kf5 40. Rf7+ Kg4 41. Bg3 Rb1 {and the game continues but
obviously Black is much better.}) 32... Bxf6 33. Rxf6+ Kg7 34. Qg3 Rxh2 35.
Qxg4+ Kf8 36. Rf3 Rxg2+ {a little trick to crown a chess jewel!} 0-1
