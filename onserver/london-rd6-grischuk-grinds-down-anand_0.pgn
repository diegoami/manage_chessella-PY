{This was maybe the most anticipated game of the round.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.
Bb5 a6 {Phew, it will not be the Berlin!} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7.
Bb3 O-O 8. d4 $5 d6 9. c3 Bg4 {We have tranposes to the early d4 variation
instead of h3 in the Ruy Lopez.} 10. Be3 exd4 (10... Nxe4 11. Bd5 $1) 11. cxd4
Na5 12. Bc2 Nc4 13. Bc1 {These undeveloping moves are not so bad because after
b3, which comes pretty soon, the bishop will be well placed on b2.} c5 14. b3
Nb6 15. Nbd2 Rc8 16. Bb2 Nfd7 17. Qb1 g6 18. h3 Bxf3 19. Nxf3 cxd4 20. Nxd4 {
The position is round about equal. White's better pawn structure and the bishop
pair is compensated by the fact that Black is ahead in development.} Bf6 21.
Qd1 (21. f4 {was what Anish wanted to do. But he was not sure about} Nc4 $6 22.
bxc4 Qb6 23. c5 $1 Qxc5 24. e5 dxe5 25. fxe5 Bxe5 26. Rd1 $16 {Black seems to
have ample compensation although objectively White is better here.}) 21... Ne5
22. Rc1 Bg5 23. Rb1 Nbd7 24. Rf1 Bf6 25. Rc1 Qb6 26. Bb1 Rxc1 ({At the post
game conference Carlsen was very upset at not having seen the simple check
which liquidates in to a drawish position.} 26... Nf3+ 27. Qxf3 Bxd4 $11) 27.
Bxc1 Nd3 28. Qxd3 Bxd4 29. Bh6 Rc8 30. Qe2 Nf8 31. g3 Ne6 32. Kg2 Bg7 33. Be3
Bd4 34. Bd2 {Anish preserves the bishop pair and tries to fight for a small
edge.} Qd8 35. Rc1 Rxc1 36. Bxc1 Qf6 37. a4 (37. b4 {with the idea of a3-Ba2
could have been much better, albiet Black should have enough resources to hold
the balance.}) 37... bxa4 38. bxa4 Nc5 39. a5 Bc3 40. Ba3 Bxa5 41. Bxc5 dxc5
