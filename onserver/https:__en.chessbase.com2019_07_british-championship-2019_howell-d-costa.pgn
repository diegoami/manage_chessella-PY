Bb7 5. Qe2 {I haven't seen this way of playing before, but I guess it has some
logic, as White is trying to dominate the center.} c5 6. e5 Ng8 7. d4 cxd4 8.
Nxd4 Nc6 9. Nxc6 Bxc6 {[#]} 10. h4 $5 {Far-sighted. Given that Black
eventually wants to play Ne7-f5, then this move makes sense, as by pushing the
pawn to f5 White deprives the knight of any support with a later ...h5. it's
also the prelude to a pawn storm, as we shall see later.} Ne7 11. h5 Nf5 12.
Bf4 Be7 {[#]} 13. Rh3 $1 {This is exactly the kind of deep-thinking that seems
to separate players like David from lesser mortals like myself.} ({In the
commentary room myself and Adam were analysing a much more flat continuation
like} 13. O-O-O Bg5 14. Qg4 {and we overlooked the idea of storming your pawns
forward on the kingside, completely.}) 13... Bg5 14. Bh2 $1 {White is now to
some degree threatening to sweep aside Black with g4, followed by f4 etc, so
already Lorin has practical problems to solve. You can see how difficult it is
playing these guys like David and Mickey, as the game has barely begun, and
already they are setting a serious examination.} O-O 15. h6 {imaginative, but
the machine feels this is unnecessary.} (15. g4 Nh6 16. f4 Bh4+ 17. Kd2 {
and White is very much for preference. Once the king sits on c2, then it is
totally safe.}) 15... Nxh6 16. f4 Bh4+ 17. g3 Be7 18. O-O-O f5 $1 19. exf6 {[#]

Bxc3 $1 21. Rxc3 Qe8 {would have lead to an unclear position- in fact the
engine even slightly favours Black.} (21... Qh4 {which I suggested in the
commentary room, is in fact a mistake because of} 22. g5 $1)) 20. g4 Rf7 21.
Qc2 Qf8 22. Bd3 {[#]} Rxf4 $2 {this is premature.} (22... g6 $1 23. Qe2 {
otherwise Black was threatening to take on g4} Rxf4 {was a much improved
version of the same sacrifice.} 24. Bxf4 Qxf4+ 25. Kb1 Rf8 {and now unlike in
the game, Black in many variations can take on g4, where he doesn't have to
worry about his h7 pawn hanging.}) 23. Bxf4 Qxf4+ 24. Kb1 Qxg4 25. Re3 $2 (25.
Bxh7+ Kh8 26. Qd3 {would have maintained some element of control.}) 25... Kh8

although to a human player this is not such an easy move to make as your
natural reaction is to fear a later capture on g6.}) 26. Be4 $1 Rf8 27. Bxc6

was the most active way to play, but I think Lorin was already in desperate
time trouble.}) 31. Qxa7 h5 32. a3 Bc5 33. Ka2 Bf2 34. Rd1 Kh7 35. Qa8 c5 36.
