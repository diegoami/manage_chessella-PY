1. e4 e5 {I knew something was up when I saw this move. Polina always played
the Pirc. When I saw e5 appear on the board, I figured she must have liked
what she saw in my database games--I just didn't yet know what it might be.} 2.
Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Now I knew! All of my database games in the Giuoco Piano
follow a rather tame line, and Polina must have banked on me continuing to use
that variation.} 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 {This was my counter.
I had played this variation in my youth but had given it up because when black
knows the lines, they tend to favor black. Once I began playing FIDE
tournaments, I switched to 7. Bd2, which is tame but at least gives white the
tiniest of edges. Since I was pretty sure Polina hadn't prepared for the
complexities of Nc3, I went for it.} Nxe4 8. O-O Nxc3 $6 {I suspected she
would play this move, which is less sound than the standard Bc3. Now my
biggest worry was that I wouldn't remember all of the complicated lines that
follow from here, since I hadn't studied them in many years.} (8... Bxc3 $142
9. d5 Bf6 10. Re1 Ne7 11. Rxe4 d6 {with a wild game that if played perfectly
should favor black in the end.}) 9. bxc3 Bxc3 $2 (9... d5 10. cxb4 dxc4 11.
Re1+ Ne7 12. Qa4+ Bd7 13. b5 O-O 14. Qxc4 $11) 10. Qb3 {I was aware that Ba3
is the strongest move, but I stared at the position for a long time and knew I
wouldn't recall the correct moves, so I went with Qb3, which I felt tended to
be easier to remember, especially if black takes the rook.} (10. Ba3 $1 d5 (

Polina spent a lot of time on this move. It's so tempting to take the rook,
but she had to know that I knew it was winning for white. I think she made the
right decision, as I get myself into trouble shortly by forgetting the right
lines.} (10... Bxa1 11. Bxf7+ Kf8 12. Bg5 Ne7 13. Ne5 Bxd4 14. Bg6 d5 15. Qf3+

agonized over this move, since nothing jogged my memory of what should be
played here.} (12. Bh5 d5 (12... g6 13. Nxd4 Nxd4 14. Qb4+ Kf7 15. Qxd4 gxh5

could manage to win this.} c6 20. Qe4+ Kf7 21. h3 Be6 22. Qf4 {This was the
right plan. I think Polina thought I would use the knight check on g5 to trade
the knight for the bishop, but that wasn't the idea here.} Rad8 $2 (22... Rhg8
