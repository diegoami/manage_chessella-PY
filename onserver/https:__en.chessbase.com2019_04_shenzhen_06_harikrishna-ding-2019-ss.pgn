{Harikrishna takes measures against Ding's Marshall.} d6 9. Bd2 $5 {This move
has been played before and Ganguly has done so against Anand and Karjakin at
Tata Steel event in India. White wants to stop Na5. But isn't the bishop
coming in the way of the knight developing on d2? Well, according to white
players, the fact that Black cannot move his knight from c6 immediately and
play c5, means that he has to find some other move to play and it is not so
easy to do something without committing a piece.} Bg4 (9... Bb7 {is another
way to play and White's idea here is} 10. a4) 10. c3 {White did play this move
and now Black can go Na5 and c3, but White can argue that he forced Black to
play Bg4, which he wouldn't have done if he hadn't played Bd2.} Na5 11. Bc2 c5
12. h3 Bh5 {Placing the bishop on h5 is always a risky strategy. On one hand
you are keeping up the pin, but on the other the bishop may become irrelevant
to the action on the queenside and centre once it is pushed back to g6.} (12...

$5 {The knight is going to move from d2, f1 to g3 and the bishop on h5 is not
going to feel very comfortable.} Nc6 14. Nbd2 d5 {Ding Liren understands that
White has a simple plan of playing his knight to f1-g3 and tries to stir up
some play in the centre.} 15. Nf1 dxe4 16. dxe4 Qxd1 17. Bxd1 {It seems as if
Black should be better here. Mainly because he is so well developed and his
rooks will be the first ones to reach the open d-file. However, this is not a
position where activity will trump static factors. Black has to do something
concrete otherwise, White will regroup and from a long term basis have a small
edge because his position has no real weaknesses, while there is a gaping hole
on d5 for Black and also White always has the ability to play a4 to open up
the queenside.} Rfd8 18. Ng3 Bg6 (18... Bxf3 19. Bxf3 {is not much for White
but is something. The bishop pair will definitely give White something to play
for.}) 19. Nh4 $5 {When it come to finding tactical solutions in placid
positions, Hari is right up there with the best.} Nd7 (19... Bxe4 20. Nxe4 Nxe4
{The knight on e4 cannot be taken as the bishop on d1 is hanging, but} 21. Nf5
$1 {I have a feeling that Hari would have gone for this move. The threat now
is Bf3.} (21. Bf3 $1 {is also possible.} Bxh4 22. Bxe4 Rac8 23. Be3 {To even
make a correct assessment of this position, shows great understanding of chess.
Harikrishna felt that his bishop pair gives him excellent compensation and he
is 100% correct.} Na5 24. b3 $44) 21... Nf6 (21... Nd6 22. Nxe7+ Nxe7 23. Rxe5
$14) (21... Bf8 $2 22. Bf3 $18) 22. Bg5 {For one pawn, White has excellent
pressure on the position. One line could go} (22. Bf3 e4 $1) 22... Ra7 23. Bf3
e4 (23... Nd5 24. Bxe7 Ndxe7 25. Nxe7+ Nxe7 26. Rxe5 $14 {When White is
slightly better.}) 24. Bxe4 (24. Nxe7+ Rxe7 25. Bxf6 gxf6 26. Rxe4 Ne5 $13)

$18) 20. Ngf5 (20. Nhf5 {looks more natural, but Hari wanted to keep the
option of taking on g6 open all the time.}) 20... Bf8 21. b3 {Hari prevents
the plan of c4 followed by Nc5 and Nd3. But Ding finds another interesting
idea.} b4 $5 (21... c4 22. bxc4 bxc4 23. Be2 $14 {The c4 pawn is extremely
weak.} Na5 24. Nxg6 hxg6 25. Ne3 $14) 22. Bb2 {Here Ding finds an exciting way
to imbalance the position and activate his pieces.} (22. cxb4 Nxb4 {Black is
pretty active here.} (22... cxb4 {is possible.})) 22... c4 $1 {An excellent
move to free up the c5 square for the knight.} 23. bxc4 Nc5 24. Bc2 {White is
a pawn up and he needs only one more move to consolidate, but that's the move
that Ding Liren is not going to give Hari easily.} Rd2 $1 25. Rac1 Bxf5 26.
Nxf5 Rad8 27. Kf1 $1 (27. Ne3 Nd3 28. Bxd3 R8xd3 {Now imagine that in this
position White had his king on f1, then he could just defend everything with
Re2!}) 27... a5 (27... g6 28. Ne3 Bh6 {This should have been considered.} 29.

fine.} 33. Ke2 (33. Nxc3 $6 Bd2 $1 $17) 33... Bd2 $11) 28. Ne3 {Now the knight
is coming to d5, so Black must do something quickly.} Nd3 29. Bxd3 Rxb2 30. Re2
$1 {A nice move to get rid of Black's active rook.} Rxe2 31. Bxe2 Rd2 {Ding
continues to play actively and naturally, but by now White pieces have
regrouped well and Hari is now ready for activity of his own.} 32. cxb4 Bxb4 (
32... axb4 {was a better move but after} 33. Rc2 {Black anyway has a long
defensive task ahead as he is a pawn down.}) 33. c5 $1 Ba3 (33... Rxa2 34. Bc4
Rb2 35. Bd5 $1 {The knight will be evicted and the pawn on c5 would be
extremely strong.}) 34. Rd1 (34. Rb1 {was also possible as after} Bxc5 35. Rc1
Bxe3 36. Rxc6 Bg5 37. Rc8+ Bd8 38. Bc4 {White is going to torture Black in
this endgame.}) 34... Rxd1+ 35. Bxd1 Bxc5 36. Nc4 {Hari has seen that he will
be able to win another pawn here.} Bd4 $6 {The bishop had to be kept on c5.} (

He has clamped the kingside pawns, the minor pieces are actively posted and
now the king joins in.} Be1 53. Kc2 Bf2 54. Nc1 f5 55. Nd3 Bg3 56. Kb3 fxe4 57.
