{Ukraine has had a great performance so far without Ivanchuk. Andrei
Volokitin's score of 7.5/8 on board 4 (he is actually the team's alternate) has
been their greatest asset for their great showing so far. In this match, he
once more shows how valuable he has been to his team so far.} 1. e4  c5  2. Nf3

game from Taimanov to Scheveningen. The setback here is that White has the
alternative of castling on the queenside.} 6. Be3  Nf6  7. Qd2  Be7  8. f3  O-O

threat. } 16. Qxb4 {(00:47) This is not new to Babula, and he played all this
last year against well-prepared Dutch GM Robin Van Kampen.} (16. b3 {is another
possibility. Volokitin himself was a victim of this move from black's side

Babula deviates first! He probably found something fishy in his game against
Van Kampen and he was not interested in discovering what Volokitin has prepared
for him in that line!} (17... Rfb8 18. Qc4 Ne5 19. Qe2 Bb5 20. Nxb5 axb5 21. c3

but now he has both b and c file open against White's king. White's attack is
still not dangerous and for the moment it is Black who has the initiative.} Ba8

vulnerable.} Qa5  22. Rh3  Ng6  (22... Rxc3 $4 {does not work due to.} 23. Bxc3

game and dark squares. Black's rook have a hard time finding an open file and
the position is extremely unpleasant for Black.} Rb7  32. Rd2  Rd7  33. Bf6+

Volokitin is in no rush. He takes his time to psychologically break Babula by
proving that he is the only one with a plan to improve his pieces.} Kg8  44. f4

(00:37) and mate follows in few moves. Babula started well and due to
Volokitin's risky move got the upper hand. Had he not missed Bxg5 he might even
have obtained a winning position. After falling for the Nd5 tactic, Volokitin
played accurately and Babula remained passive. Once can conclude that Volokitin
won because he better adjusted himself to the changes that happened to the
characteristics of the resulting position after Nd5.} 1-0
