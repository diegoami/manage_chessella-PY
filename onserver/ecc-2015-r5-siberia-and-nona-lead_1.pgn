{Yu Yangyi (black) has an extra pawn, but it is almost useless, as any
reasonable pawn endgame would be a draw. After shuffling around a bit, the
Chinese player uses his final trump to play f6-f5.} 73... f5 74. Qd6+ $2 {This
is the critical mistake. Now White is just lost.} (74. Kf3 $1 {would have
ensured an easy draw but this was the only way to secure the half point.} Qxf4+
75. Kxf4 fxg4 76. Kxg4 $11 {White has the opposition and there is absolutely no
way that the black king can make his way up to the key squares (g5,f5,e5).})
(74. Qxf5+ Qxf5 75. gxf5+ Kxf5 76. Kf3 {would have been a draw if it wouldn't
have been for the dreaded waiting move in the pawn endgames!} f6 $1 $19 {The
key squares for the f6 pawn are e4,f4,g4 and the black king will reach one of
them on his next move.}) 74... Kh7 $1 (74... f6 $2 75. Qd4 fxg4 76. Qxg4 Qxg4+
77. Kxg4 $11) 75. Qd7 (75. Qd4 Qxg4+ 76. Qxg4 fxg4 77. Kxg4 Kg6 $1 $19 {Black
has the opposition and he just wins the game.}) 75... Qxg4+ {This win might
involve some effort but considering the match situation and also how things
changed in just one move, you can safely say that it is an easy win for the
Chinese player.} 76. Kf2 Qf4+ 77. Kg2 Kg6 78. Qc8 Qe4+ 79. Kf2 f4 80. Qg8+ Kf6
