position.} Rd8 16. Qd2 Nh7 (16... Kh7 17. Bf4 Qe7 18. Rad1 $14) 17. Ng3 (17.

White has an excellent attack. However, It turns out that Black can get a
great position by following the ancient advice: A flank attack must be
countered by a pawn break in the centre.} f5 $6 (22... d5 $5 23. cxd5 (23. Qd4+

The game is just over as the queen comes to b2 and penetrates down to g7 or h8.
