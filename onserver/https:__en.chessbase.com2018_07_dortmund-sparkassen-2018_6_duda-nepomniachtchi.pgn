{[#]} {We join game of the round after move 42 where it was the young Polish
phenom who had masterfully outplayed the tournament leader to get the
following wonderful position. White has every trump you could hope for in this
line of the Sicilian; a beautifully supported knight on d5, a clamp on the
queenside, a potential break on the kingside and Black has got close to no
active plan. Nepo quite understandbly took drastic measures} 42. h4 b5 {
probably forced, what else?} 43. axb6 Bxb6 44. Nxb6 $6 (44. g5 $1 {with the
bishop having departed d8, this is now an extremely strong move} Bxd5 45. g6+
$1 Kh8 46. Nxd5 $18 {and Black is unlikely to be able to cover the multiple
weaknesses in his position (a6, d6, f6&h6 potential sacrifices etc)}) 44...
Rxb6 45. Bxc5 dxc5 46. Rxa6 {Winning a pawn like this can hardly be
over-criticised, but it does give Black greater chances to counter compared to
the previous line.} Rcb8 47. Rxb6 Rxb6 48. Ra7 Rb8 49. Na4 $6 {a serious
innacuracy} (49. Qd1 $1 Rd8 50. Nd5 $16 {and White maintains control}) 49...
Rd8 $5 {Nepo spots a nice swindle attempt} 50. Nxc5 Rd4 51. Kf3 $2 (51. g5 $1 {
should still be good enough e.g.} fxg5 52. hxg5 hxg5 53. Qc1 {[%cal Rc1g5] is
completely over}) 51... Qc6 $1 52. Na4 $4 {White completely loses control and
misses a nice shot} Bxc4 $1 {ouch} 53. bxc4 Rxc4 {now White can't
simultaneously defend e4 and a4 and the game simply peters out.} 54. Qb1 Rxa4
55. Rxa4 Qxa4 56. Qd3 Qa1 57. Kg2 Qc1 58. h5 Qf4 1/2-1/2
