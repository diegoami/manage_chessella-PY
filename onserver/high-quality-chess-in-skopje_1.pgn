hxg6 28. Ng3 {We catch this endgame from this point onwards. It's Black to
play. The position looks completely in White's favour because of the pawn
structure. Black has doubled isolated pawns on the kingside, an isolated guy on
e5 and a weak pawn on c5. But White's position is not fireproof. The c2 pawn is
a little weak, and with his next move Adam shows that he doesn't really need to
move his rook in order to activate it.} a5 $1 29. Ne4 Nd4 30. Rf2 $1 {Rublevsky
right decides that keeping control is important.} (30. Nxc5 Rc8 $132 {Gives
Black enough counterplay.} (30... Nxc2 31. Rc1 (31. Rf2 Nd4) 31... Nd4 32. Re1
$14)) 30... a4 $1 {Right spirit. Whether it works or not, activity is the key.}
(30... Rc8 31. Nd6 Rd8 32. Nc4 $14 {leads to a thankless position that would
have to be constantly defended.}) 31. Nxc5 a3 $1 {Fixing the a2 pawn and
getting a real asset in this position. But to attack the a2 pawn is not so
easy, the black knight cannot reach c3 because the knight on e4 will all the
time keep an eye on it.} 32. Nd7 $6 Re8 (32... Nb5 $1 33. Nxe5 Nc3 {As we
mentioned previously, the white knight went away from e4 and the other knight
made its way to c3.} 34. Nxg6 Nxa2 35. Ne7+ Kh7 36. Nc6 Ra6 37. Nd4 Nc3 38. Rf1

Nxa2 38. Ne4 $14 {The general idea of this variation is that the knight should
remain in the centre and not like in the game where it was sidelined on a4.})
34... Nb5 35. Na4 {[%cal Rb5c3] Knight to c3 had to be stopped. But in that bid
the knight on a4 has becoming quite passive.} Rc8 ( 35... e4 36. dxe4 Rd1+ 37.

Ra2] The rook on a2 is trapped.}) 36. Ke1 Nd4 37. Kd1 Rc6 {[%csl Ra4] As GM
Jesse Kraai says, Tesuji against the knight on a4. The rook on c6 dominates
it.} 38. h4 $2 {What could be more natural than to restrict the doubled
g-pawns? But now Adams shows his class.} (38. Kc1 Kh7 39. g4 g5 40. Kd1 Kg6 41.
Kc1 {It is true that all of White's pieces are passively posted but they are
passive because black pieces are well placed. If the black pieces move then
White ones can also wriggle out. So the position should most likely end in a
draw.}) 38... g5 $1 {[#] This is the right way to activate the king.} 39. hxg5
Kh7 {Rublevsky is lost now because while all his pieces are tied down, the
black king is free to roam and collect stuff.} 40. Kc1 Kg6 41. c3 {Of course
something had to be done.} bxc3 42. b4 c2 43. Nc5 Rb6 44. Rf1 Rxb4 45. Nb3

Black has cleaned up so many pawns that he is a pawn up.} 49. Re1 a2 50. Kb3
Kf5 51. Ka3 Rd2 52. Kb3 g6 {A beautiful performance by Mickey Adams who showed
us the most important thing in the endgame is not material, but activity.} 0-1
