{This was Adhiban's favourite game of the tournament. He plays it in coffee
house style!} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 a6 7.
Re1 Ba7 {Look how Adhiban is delaying the move 0-0. He knows that he as long
as he doesn't castle, he has the chances to expand on the kingside with h6-g5
or Ng4 followed by an attack.} 8. a4 Ng4 9. Re2 Qf6 {This position had been
reached in Adhiban's game before where he his opponent van Foreest had played
Na3. This was the first time that Nbd2 was played.} 10. Nbd2 g5 $1 {A move
that may not be 100% correct, but leads to interesting positions! When coffee
house chess triumphs at this level, it is truly exciting!} 11. Qe1 $6 {Too
passive.} (11. d4 $1 {should have been preferred by Bassem. The logic is
simple - flank attack should be countered by play in the centre.} exd4 12. e5
$1 Ngxe5 13. cxd4 Bxd4 (13... Nxd4 14. Nxd4 Bxd4 15. Ne4 $16) 14. Ne4 Qg7 15.
Nexg5 $16) 11... Rg8 12. Nf1 h5 {Adhiban gets it going.} 13. Qd2 {The g5 pawn
is falling, but who cares!} Be6 14. Bd5 (14. Nxg5 Bxc4 15. dxc4 Na5 $1 $19)
14... Bxd5 {A calm and level headed move. Adhiban remembered the advice of his
coach Elizbar Ubilava who told him not to get too creative without reason.} (
14... Ne7 {was one of the variations that Adhiban calculated.} 15. Bxb7 Rb8 16.
Bxa6 Ng6 17. Qxg5 Nf4 18. Bxf4 $1 (18. Qxf6 Nxe2+ 19. Kh1 Nxf2# {is a pretty
mate.}) (18. Qxg8+ Kd7 19. Bxf4 Rxg8 {with a complex position.}) 18... Rxg5 19.
Bxg5 $18 {White just has too much material and is better.}) 15. exd5 Ne7 16. d4
(16. Nxg5 Nxf2 $17) 16... O-O-O {The ambitious play as worked. Black has
completed his development and is clearly better.} 17. h3 (17. Nxg5 Nxd5 $19)
17... Nh6 18. Ng3 (18. Nxg5 Nhf5 $40) 18... Nxd5 19. Nxh5 Qg6 20. Ng3 Nf4 21.
Re4 Nf5 {Adhiban's moves are strong and filled with purpose. Amin has no real
options, but to hope for an error.} 22. Qc2 Nh4 $1 23. dxe5 Nxf3+ 24. gxf3
Nxh3+ 25. Kf1 Nxf2 $1 {The final straw.} 26. Re2 Nd3 27. exd6 Qxd6 28. Ne4 Qd7
29. Rh2 g4 {An excellently played game by Adhiban. One only wonders what would
have happened had Bassem played d4 to Adhiban's g5. Once White didn't play
without fear, it was all one way traffic.} 0-1
