life hangs on the success of this kingside attack.} Qc7 21. Rae1 Bf8 22. Bg5 g6
23. f4 Bg7 24. Qh4 Bb7 25. Kf2 $1 {Black is in some serious trouble now. The
rook is swinging to the h-file reinforcing the attack. The even bigger issue,
however, is that Black simply has no counterplay.} Rf8 $2 { This just
accelerates defeat.} (25... Nf8 26. Bf6 $18) (25... Qc6 26. Be4 Qxe4 27. Rxe4
Bxe4 {looks desperate, but probably was already appropriate.}) 26. Rh1 f5 27.
hxg6 hxg6 28. Qh7+ Kf7 29. Rh6 {Sometimes players have blindspots, and forget
that one move that can cause an attack to crash through. The only reason I can
imagine why Laznicka did not put up the appropriate amount of resistance is
that he forgot Rh6 was playable.} 1-0
