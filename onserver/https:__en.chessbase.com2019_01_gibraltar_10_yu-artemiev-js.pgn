O-O Bg6 7. c3 Nh6 8. a4 a5 (8... Rc8 {was played in the game Adams-Conquest,
British Championship 2010, but didn't work out too well for our much-loved
tournament director.}) 9. Na3 {Exiting the book, but maybe this is a
theory-lite system anyway.} Be7 10. Nc2 O-O 11. Nce1 c5 12. Bxh6 gxh6 13. Bb5
cxd4 14. cxd4 Nb8 $5 {The equivalent of football's Cruyff turn, where the
player on the ball turns back suddenly and tries to go round the defender a
different way?} 15. Qd2 Kg7 16. Nd3 {Around here engines much prefer White,
unless you leave them to search a bit long when they calculate that Black's
positional weakness on the kingside is less serious than it looks.} Na6 17. Nf4
Qb6 18. h4 Rfc8 19. Rfc1 Rxc1+ 20. Rxc1 Nb4 21. g3 Na2 $1 {Overlooked by
engines, this move is simply designed to evict the white rook from the c-file
to allow his own rook to occupy it.} 22. Rd1 Rc8 23. Nh2 Qc7 $1 ({Better than
the tempting} 23... Rc2 $6 {when} 24. Qe3 {sets up the threat of Nxg6, Ng4 and
an invasion on h6.}) 24. Bd3 h5 {A necessary precaution to prevent the h2
knight coming to g4. Black probably realised he was losing a kingside pawn but
was banking on his queenside pressure being sufficient compensation.} 25. g4
Nb4 26. Bxg6 ({If} 26. Bb1 hxg4 27. Nxg4 Bxb1 28. Nh5+ Kh8 29. Rxb1 (29. Qh6 {
fails to} Rg8 30. Nhf6 Qc2) 29... Qc2 {and the position greatly favours Black.}
) 26... hxg6 27. gxh5 {White has his extra pawn but Black now starts his
queenside counter.} Qc2 28. hxg6 Qf5 29. Qe3 ({Maybe White should take his
chances with} 29. gxf7 $5 Bxh4 {which gets messy, with kingside threats for
Black in the air, but shouldn't be worse for White with best play.}) 29... fxg6
30. Qg3 Rf8 31. Ng2 Qc2 32. Ne3 Qe4 {[#]} 33. Neg4 $2 ({After the shadow
boxing of the last few moves, White miscalculates. Instead} 33. Ng2 {is fine.
Perhaps White thought his extra pawn was worth trying to exploit.}) 33... Nc6
$1 {Black switches focus onto the d4-pawn.} 34. Qe3 Rf4 $1 35. Nf6 (35. Qxe4
Rxe4 {is even worse with the d4-pawn lost and the h4-pawn also in danger.
White is obliged to cash in his extra pawn to try and right his ship.}) 35...
Bxf6 36. exf6+ Kxf6 37. Qxe4 Rxe4 38. Nf3 Ne7 $1 {This wonderful knight is on
the move again, this time to menace the d4 and h4 pawns simultaneously from f5.
} 39. Kg2 Nf5 40. Rd3 Nxh4+ {Its job well done, the knight leaves the board
with its master very close to being Â£25,000 richer.} 41. Nxh4 Rxh4 42. Kg3 g5
43. Kg2 ({After} 43. Rf3+ Kg6 44. Re3 Kf5 {White is no better off.}) 43... Re4

White can chase the king back with} 50. Re2+ Kf5 51. Re5+ Kf6 {but it makes no
difference as his pawns drop like ripe apples.}) 50... Kf5 51. Rd3 Rh1 52. Kg2
Rh3 (52... Rh3 53. Rxh3 gxh3+ 54. Kxh3 Ke4 {is an easily won king and pawn
endgame.}) 0-1
