hitting the c4-pawn repeatedly, and White does not have enough attacking

This is the critical move, after which Black should be worried. I see no
reason to revise my assessments or lines from 2018. However, the advantage is

up to move 30, then probably he also anticipated the game up to this point.
His advantage stems from greater king safety (a 2 pawn cover rather than 1)
and a more stable knight.} 36. Ra6 $1 Nc6 37. Nf3 Rc8 38. Re6 Rc7 39. Kh2 Kg7

the game is over! A truly perplexing encounter. In terms of redefining opening
theory, this is probably about as epoch-marking as the Carlsen-Kramnik game in
the QGD, after which almost nobody played with the doubled f-pawns anymore!}
