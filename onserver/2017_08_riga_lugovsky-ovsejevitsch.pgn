{[#]} 41. Qa3 {the position after move 40 is completely winning for black. He
is two pawns up, has the better light piece and the white rook on f5 is in
danger of getting embarrassed by ...Nd4. In a "normal" time control, Lugovsky
could consider of giving up, but consistently being under time pressure, the
black position turns out to be hard to handle - even for such a strong
grandmaster as Ovsejevitsch.} Nd4 42. Rc1 b4 43. Qa2 b3 $2 ({there is nothing
wrong with} 43... Nxf5 {but who would give up such a strong knight against the
poorly placed rook on f5?} 44. gxf5 Rd6 {and white could try to complicate

see a way for white to mudden the waters.}) 44. Qa3 $1 {The queen attacks the
pawn on c5 and suddenly things turn out to be complicated} Kf7 $2 (44... Ne6 {
