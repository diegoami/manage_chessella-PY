1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Nb6 5. exd6 cxd6 6. Be3 ({Since this game
was played the line} 6. Nc3 g6 7. Be3 Bg7 8. Rc1 O-O 9. b3 {has become both
popular and successful, so much so that most Alekhine addicts have switched to
recapturing with the e-pawn on move 5. Yet at the time this game was played
this plan was not known and I had seen a plan of Bill Hartston that I liked.})
6... g6 7. h4 {This is it, Hartston's move. The idea is to exploit the fact
that Black's knights are far away from his kingside by immediately starting an
attack. And if Black stops this with 7...h5 he will leave a weak square on g5
if he follows up with a later ...e5 and ...f5.} Bg7 ({In Hartston - Bryson,
BCF-ch, Edinburgh, 1985 Black prevented the further advance of White's h-pawn
with} 7... h5 {but then} 8. d5 N8d7 9. Bd4 Nf6 10. Bd3 Bg7 11. Nh3 $5 O-O 12.
Ng5 e5 13. dxe6 Bxe6 {would have been better for White had he now played the
simple} 14. O-O {.}) 8. h5 Nc6 9. Nc3 d5 $6 {Success; Black doesn't like the
look of castling into the opening h-file and plays something much worse.} ({
In fact the right move was the cold blooded} 9... O-O {after which} 10. Qd2 $5
e5 11. d5 Nd4 12. O-O-O $5 {was the adventurous continuation of Hartston -
Planinec, Hastings 1974-75. I think that I might have played 10.hxg6 instead.})
10. c5 Nc4 11. Bxc4 dxc4 12. Nge2 ({Carefully avoiding} 12. Nf3 Bg4 $1 {
, which would give Black excellent counterplay. But now he has the serious
problem of how to defend that weak c4 pawn.}) 12... Qa5 13. h6 {The h-file
isn't the relevant factor now, it's more the weak c4 pawn and White's mobile
d- and c-pawns. So it's good to put Black's g7 bishop on a square where it can
be hit by Nc3-e4.} Bf6 14. O-O O-O 15. d5 Nb4 16. Ne4 Bh8 ({After} 16... Bxb2 {
White can play} 17. Rb1 Qxa2 (17... Bh8 18. Bd2 c3 19. Bxc3 Bxc3 20. N2xc3 {
leaves Black facing threats of Qd4 and d6.}) 18. N2c3 Qa3 19. Qd4 f6 20. Qxc4 {
is horrendous for Black who would be unable to rescue his offside pieces AND
save his king.}) 17. Bd4 Nd3 18. Bxh8 Kxh8 19. Qc2 Qb4 (19... Nxc5 20. Qxc4
Nxe4 21. Qxe4 {is very unpleasant for Black as both e7 and his king are weak
and White can must pile his pieces into the middle of the board (Rad1, Rfe1
and Nc3/d4/f4).}) 20. b3 Bf5 (20... Nxc5 21. Nxc5 Qxc5 22. bxc4 {would still
be very attractive for White.}) 21. N2g3 Bxe4 22. Nxe4 Nxc5 23. bxc4 Nxe4 24.
Qxe4 {The exchange of minor pieces has done little to ease the defence, both
e7 and Black's king are still major problems. In addition it is relatively
easy to play White's position which is always useful in a key game.} b6 25.
Rfe1 Rfe8 26. Qe5+ f6 27. Qe6 Qd2 28. Re3 Qd4 29. Rae1 Qf4 30. Rh3 {Possibly
some nerves creeping in.} (30. d6 {was already winning, for example} Qxh6 31.
d7 Red8 32. Qxe7 {leaves Black with no good defence.}) 30... Rac8 (30... Qxc4 {
was the last try, though White then wins with} 31. Qf7 Rg8 32. Qxe7 ({And not} 
32. Rxe7 {because of} Qc1+ 33. Kh2 Qf4+ {with a draw by perpetual check.})) 31.
d6 Rxc4 ({After} 31... Qxd6 32. Qf7 Rg8 33. Rxe7 {there's no perpetual this
time.}) ({And of course} 31... exd6 32. Qxe8+ {leads to mate.}) 32. Qf7 Rg8 33.
dxe7 Re4 34. Rxe4 {When Black recaptures on e4 White plays Qxf6+ followed by
mate.} 1-0
