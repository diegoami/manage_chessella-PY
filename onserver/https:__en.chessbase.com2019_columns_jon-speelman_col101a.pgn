played after 2...e6 but here with Black able to block the long diagonal in one
move rather than in two after ...e7-e6-e5, b3 is less common.} d6 4. Bb2 e5 5.

well but he's a long way from achieving this.} Nf6 6. Qe2) 5... Bg4 {I don't
think I'd be developing the bishop on g4 though of course it's perfectly
playable.} (5... g6 6. Bg2 Bg7 7. O-O Nge7 {looks fairly normal when Black may

to move the d-pawn and allow an exchange on e3 which maims his pawns.}) 18.

what looks like edge to me though my software disagrees. One thing is that the
bishop really isn't great on b2 while the pawn is on e5. If you could get Ne4
and Be3 then that looks better but it's obviously not practicable here.}))

either tries to bail out or panics according to your point of view. The

defence. But you'd be very tempted in a game to have a clear extra pawn as
Fadi did.}) 27... b6 (27... Bb1 $1 {was better to counterattack.} 28. a4 (28.

the bishop must move and after Bxb3 Black will be able to reach one bishop vs
two at the very worst.}) 58. Bxb3 {[#] Here Fadi agreed a draw presumably
after counting out the variation Ke6-f7 followed by Bf8. When I saw the result,
I wondered for an instant if it was drawn myself. But even if you didn't
immediately see the win, there would be no reason to agree a draw here as
White, since the very worst that can happen is a dead drawn queen ending. In
fact White is winning easily. A horrible end to a game in which Fadi played
the opeing rather conservatively but got a decent position and later the
advantage. He stumbled near the end, but so did his opponent, and he very
nearly wrapped it up before losing his way again at the very end.} (58. Bxb3

I wondered whether Black would have any chances with a b-pawn and bishop if
the pawn was further advanced and the king further away but when I lazily
asked a tablebase even Ka3,b3,Bc3 vs Kh7,Qg8 with Black to move is lost after
1. ..b2 2 Qg6 Ka2 3 Qa6+ though by then Qa6+ is apparently the only move so it
is close by then.}) 59... Bg7 60. Ke6 b4 61. Kf7 Bc3 62. Bf6) 1/2-1/2
