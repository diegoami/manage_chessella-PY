preferable, but I felt that even after the reply 24. ... Bxd4 I would not be
worse and that the move offered many chances for Black to go wrong.} (24. Nf3 {
The engine's preferred choice. Black would need to play precisely and White
might keep a small positional edge with best play.} g6 25. Kh1 Rfe8 26. b3 $14

rather quickly. After that White is already very close to winning. In the
post-mortem he also mentioned the option of 24. ... Bxd4 and went through a
few lines. It is not easy to find good moves for Black there: In the most
straightforward variation 24. ... Bxd4 25. Bxf5 Bxf2+ 26. Kxf2, White has two
minor pieces for the rook, strongly centralized pieces and threatens a capture
on h7 and a discovered attack on the Queen. And in variations where Black
delays taking on f2, for example when Black plays the (only) move 25. ... Rxf5,
the Black position seems very risky at first glance: Black is temporarily a
full rook down, the white Knight can also go for e5 and it is hard to see how
Black can avoid being at least a piece down in the long run. Of course neither
of us had seen the very complex computer moves after 24. ... Bxd4 that
ultimately allow Black to keep the material balance.} (24... Bxd4 $7 {This
initiates a forcing sequence of moves, leading to a sharp position.} 25. Bxf5
