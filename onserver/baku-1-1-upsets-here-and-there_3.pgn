25. Rxa5 {Black's position isn't a lot of fun. He has some problems with his
king which are not trivial to solve, but he should still be able to hang on}
Bd5 $2 {Ni Hua must have forgotten about a small detail!} (25... Bf5 $1) (25...
Rb8 $1 26. Ne4 Bf5 27. Nc5+ Kd6 {and I don't see any immediate problems with
Black's position.}) 26. Na4 $1 Rc4 (26... Rb8 27. Nc5+ Kd6 28. Bxd5 {doesn't
work anymore, as Black simply gets mated on e6 if he retakes the bishop!}) (
26... Rxa4 27. Rxa4 Bxf3 28. gxf3 Nd5 {was best case scenario, but still
heavily favoring White.}) (26... Bxf3 27. Nc5+ Kd6 28. Nxb7+ Kd7 29. Nc5+ Kd6

32. Bxd5+ Nxd5 {The win is still far from trivial, but Mareco's technique was
fabulous and he converted his extra exchange in a long endgame.} 1-0
