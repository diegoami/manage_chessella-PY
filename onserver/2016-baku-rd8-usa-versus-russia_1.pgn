{Today saw an epic victory for the undergunned US women's team against Russia,
the incumbent champions. In this topsy-turvy match, Katerina Nemcova first put
the US team in the lead only to see Valentina Gunina equalize by beating Nazi
Paikidze. With Zatonskih and Pogonina ending in a draw, it all came down to the
mighty first board clash on board one, where ex-world champion GM Alexandra
Kosteniuk faced multiple US women's champion GM Irina Krush.} 1. e4  c5  2. Nf3
 e6  3. d4  cxd4  4. Nxd4  a6 {(16s) Krush plays the "Kan-Paulsen" system,
whose disappearance from top-level competition might lead one to think it is
considered "risky'. Nevertheless, in such a crucial match, only those who have
the guts and eagerness to take such risks can hope for victory.} 5. Bd3  Nf6 
6. O-O  Qc7  7. Qe2  d6  8. a4  (8. c4 {is the mainline.}) 8... b6 {(439s)
otherwise a5 would have fixed Black's queenside.} 9. f4 {(249s) Already an
uncommon way of handling this opening.} Nbd7  10. b4 $5 $146 {(503s) An
interesting novelty by Kosteniuk. The bishop will go to b2 while the c5 square
is taken away from Black. A very creative idea by Kosteniuk.} d5 $2 {(1357s)
Krush's reaction is very human but rather overly optimistic. She gives away
more space when her king is still in the center.} (10... e5 11. Nf5 Bb7 {was
probably a better choice and what Kosteniuk had probably prepared for.}) 11. e5
 Ne4 { (18s) White cannot win a pawn on e4 because her pawn on b4 is en prise.
Nevertheless, I assure you that White does not want that pawn at the cost of
her light squared bishop which would give Black a lot of compensation along the
a8-h1 diagonal and c and d files.} 12. Ba3  a5  (12... Bb7 13. c4 {looks close
to lost for Black. Irina Krush is in deep trouble.}) 13. Nb5  Qc6  14. bxa5 
Bc5+  (14... Bxa3 15. N1xa3 O-O 16. c4 Ndc5 {Looks bad but playable for
Black.}) 15. Bxc5  Ndxc5 $6 { (23s) Irina misses a nasty tactic.} 16. Na7 $1
{(607s) Kosteniuk has played superbly so far. The knight on a7 is
'untouchable'} Qc7  (16... Rxa7 $4 17. Bb5 {and the pin costs Black a queen.})
17. axb6  Qxb6  18. Nxc8  Rxc8  19. Bb5+  Nd7+  20. Kh1  Qa7  21. Bd3  Ndc5 
(21... O-O 22. Bxe4 dxe4 23. Qxe4 Nb6 24. Nd2 Rfd8 25. Rfd1 Qa5 {surprisingly
gives Black good chances to fight for a draw.}) 22. Qe3  Rc7 $6 {(51s) This
again loses a tempo.} (22... Ra8 {was necessary and Black should hope to hold a
middlgame a pawn down.}) 23. Na3  Qa5  24. Nb5  Rc8  25. Nd4 $6 {(132s) This
lets go off some of White's advantage.} (25. Bxe4 Nxe4 26. Qa3 {followed by f5
looks very nasty.}) 25... O-O  26. Bb5  Ra8  27. Rf3 $6 { (269s) An
inappropriate square for the rook.} (27. Rfe1 {with the idea of c4 or f5 to
undermine Black's strong centralized knights.}) 27... Qb4  28. Bc6  Ra6 $6 
(28... Rac8 29. f5 Qb8 {was probably better.}) 29. f5  Rc8  30. Bb5  Raa8  31.
c3 $6  (31. Rd1 {is a strong prophylactic move which prevents Black's attempt
to exchange queens.}) 31... Qb2  32. Raf1 $6  (32. Rd1 {This is still better.}
Nxa4 $2 33. fxe6 fxe6 34. Bd7 {with a winning attack.}) 32... Qd2  33. fxe6 
fxe6  34. Nc6 $6  Rc7  35. Qd4 { (58s) Most of White's advantage has fizzled
out.} h6 $1 {(20s) A necessary vent for Black's king when neither side has much
to improve.} 36. Qb4  Qg5 {(51s) Ok, but a bit counter-intuitive.} (36... Rb7
{forces} 37. a5 { and now} Kh7 $1 {with a difficult position for... White!} 38.
Nd4 {for instance runs into} Qa2) 37. g3  Qd2  38. Nd4  Qg5  39. Nc6  Qd2  40.
Nd4  Qg5  41. Bc6  Rac8  42. c4  Qd2  43. Qxd2 $6  (43. Rf8+ {is a beautiful
trick but it is in vain. Nevertheless, it was better than exchanging queens.}
Kh7 (43... Rxf8 $4 44. Rxf8+ Kxf8 45. Qb8+ Ke7 46. Qe8#)) 43... Nxd2  44. cxd5 
Nxf3  45. Rxf3  exd5 {(25s) Krush's stubborn play paid off. She is back in the
game with full control. With all these open files in this position, Black's
rooks would 'rule' the board and White's extra pawns for the exchange are
'weak' compensation. Nevertheless, White should be able to hold with accurate
play.} 46. Bxd5+  Kh7  47. Rf4 $2 {(398s) I do not understand this move. White
needed some active play with e6.} (47. e6 $1 Nxa4 48. Re3 Nb6 49. Bc6 Nc4 50.

Bc4  g5 $1 { (64s) Now we have the proof of why Rf4 was wrong.} 49. e6  gxf4 
50. exd7  Nxd7  51. Bd3+  Kh8  52. Bf5  Rc1+  53. Kg2  Nc5  54. gxf4 {(94s)
White parts with her pawns, but she really does not have any choice.} (54. Ne2
f3+ $1 55. Kxf3 Rf1+ 56. Kg4 Rf2) 54... Nxa4  55. Kg3  Nc5  56. Ne6  Nd7  57.
Nd4  Nf6  58. Nf3  Rc3 {(26s) White's f4 pawn will collapse soon.} 59. h3  Kg7 
60. Bb1  Rc4  61. Ne5  Rb4  62. Bg6  Nd5  63. Bf5  Nxf4 { (56s) Now Black
should be technically winning.} 64. Ng4  Ne2+  65. Kh4  Nd4  66. Be4  Ne6  67.
Bg2  h5 $1 { (14s) An elegant finish for a well-fought battle. Kosteniuk won
the first half of the match but Krush won the second half and unfortunately for
Kosteniuk, Irina Krush only made the 'penultimate' mistake in this game!}
(67... h5 68. Kxh5 Nf4+) 0-1
