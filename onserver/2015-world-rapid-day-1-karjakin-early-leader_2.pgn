1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 g6 3. Nc3 {Grischuk plays the line of his good friend Baadur
Jobava.} d5 4. Qd2 Bg7 5. O-O-O c6 6. f3 Nbd7 7. Bh6 O-O 8. h4 {White has not
really developed his pieces and starts an attack in the style of the Dragon. So
when your opponent starts a flank attack, what must you do?} e5 {Strike in the
center!} 9. Bxg7 Kxg7 10. h5 $6 (10. dxe5 Nxe5 11. e4 {was a better way for
White to play.}) 10... exd4 11. Qxd4 c5 12. Qd2 d4 13. Nb1 $2 {This is
overambitious play by Grischuk. He thinks that his attack will break through on
the kingside but if it doesn't then what is his knight doing on b1?} (13. Ne4
{was much better when black has to be careful as his knight on f6 is the only
defender of his kingside.}) 13... Qe7 14. hxg6 fxg6 15. Qh6+ Kg8 16. e4 Ne5 $1
{Black stops Bc4 and his co-ordination is just perfect.} 17. Na3 Be6 18. Nh3 c4
$6 (18... a6 {Threatening b5 would have kept complete control.} 19. Ng5 b5 $17)
19. Rxd4 c3 {Black's counter attack is swift and very difficult to defend in
rapid format.} 20. Ng5 Bxa2 21. Bb5 (21. Nb5 {was the only way to defend but
here too Black seems to have good attacking chances.}) 21... Rac8 22. Ba4 Rfd8
$1 {Bringing in the reserves.} 23. Rxd8+ Rxd8 24. Nb1 $2 cxb2+ 25. Kxb2 Qb4+
26. Kxa2 {and now mere mortals would have taken on a4 but Vidit spots the
mate.} Nc4 $1 {Mate on b2 cannot be averted as Bb3 is met with Qa5+! A very
nice game by the Indian youngster.} 0-1
