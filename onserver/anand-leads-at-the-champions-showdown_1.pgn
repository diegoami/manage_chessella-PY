1. c4  e5 {20 This is a very popular response against 1.c4. It leads to some
kind of Sicilian with an extra move for white, but black gets good play in the
center.} 2. Nc3  Bb4 $5 {0 Intending to take on c3 at some point.} 3. Nd5 {0
This is the most natural move.} Bc5 {0 This is by far the main move. (372 games
in Mega 2016)} (3... Be7 {is also very popular.(371 games in Mega 2016)}) 4.

Very logical move.} 13. O-O  (13. c4 $5 Qa5 {This seems to be the best reply.

against c4.} 14. Bc1  a6  15. a4  Qd7 {44 A very closed position has arisen.
Black wants to play something like Qb7, Bf5 and Nbd7, or Ra7 and Rb7 followed
by Qf5 and Qg6/ g5 with a comfortable position.} 16. f4 {315 Naka tries to
close the position on the kingside.} exf3 {129 This is, of course, a natural
and strong move.} 17. Nxf3  Ne4  18. Ne5 {87 I think white could have delayed
it.} (18. Qc2 $5 f6 (18... Qb7 19. Nd2 Nxd2 20. Bxd2 Nd7 21. Rxf7 $5 {This

20. Qc2  Nxa4 {162 Black gets two pawns for the exchange, and white has two
more( atleast one more)weak pawn/s But his small problem is that his queenside
pieces are still at their starting positions, but they will come out soon.} 21.

attacks the e5 pawn, and has some intentions of playing Be6 and Nd7.} 22. Bd3

important to eliminate the bishop.} 29. Qxd3  Nc3  30. Rxd4  b4 $17 {131 The
black pawns are very fast.} 31. Qd2  h5 {102 Reducing the effect of Qh6.} 32.

prophylactic move, preventing Qh6.} 34. Rf6  Nd5  35. Qg5  Qg8 {116 There is no
need to take on f6 immediately.} 36. Qh4  (36. Rh4 {May look scary, but black
has nothing to fear after...} Qg7) 36... Nxf6  37. exf6  b3 $19 {14 The game is

sacrificed an exchange early in the opening and got excellent compensation. I
think white could and should have delayed Ne5 move. The sacrifice with Rxf7
looks interesting.} 0-1
