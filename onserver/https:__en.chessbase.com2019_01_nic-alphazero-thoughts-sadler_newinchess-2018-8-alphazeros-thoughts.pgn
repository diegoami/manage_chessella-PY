AlphaZero's main choice, which preferred the standard main line}

with a fairly positive expected score of 65-70_percent_. Still closer to
a draw than a win but definitely chances for White. Let's take a look at
some of the lines that AlphaZero looked at in building up this
assessment.} ) 11.Nd2 dxc4 {AlphaZero's main continuation.} ( 11...d4
{is great fun, but (impressively) AlphaZero's 1-millisecond line is
essentially the main line you find after analysing with other engines:
Black sacrifices a piece, gets it back and ends up a bit worse with a
terrible pawn structure:} 12.Nb3 Qb6 13.Na4 Bb4+ 14.axb4 Qxb4+ 15.Nd2

almost 60_percent_ expected score. We suppose that with deep preparation
of this middlegame as Black, you might be able to get away with this
line if you're happy fighting for a draw.} ) 12.Nxc4 {AlphaZero's
preferred choice, though we were keener on the more aggressive 12. Bxc4,
keeping more pieces on the board.} ( 12.Bxc4 Be7 {, and now:} 13.0-0 (
13.Bd3 {was an almost equivalent move, according to AlphaZero. Again we
like this move a little more than AlphaZero's main line, as it keeps
more pieces on the board:} 13...e5 14.Nc4 Qc7 15.Nb5 Qb8 16.Bg3 Bg4

on) } 14.Nde4 Nd5 15.Qc1 ( 15.Bg3 Nxc3 16.bxc3 Rxd1 ( 16...Ne5

ideas are very similar to the main line} ) 17.exf4 Bd7 {, and now a main
line that feels tactically very fraught, but was more or less the only
line that AlphaZero seriously considered (!) :} 18.b4 Rc8 19.Rd1 Ba4 (

27.Nd6 Rc7 28.e4 f6 29.Bb5 Ke7 30.e5 {, with a 59_percent_ expected
score for White. This line is an example of why analysing with AlphaZero
in the opening is an unusually instructive experience. Out of a mass of
possibilities, it invariably takes a clear, coherent view on one path
and pursues it with enormous focus and vigour. It's like having Karpov
or Kramnik on tap and asking them for a clear opinion about any
position! The resulting line is a wonderful framework around which to
build your own understanding of the position and develop your own ideas.
It's going too far to claim that AlphaZero's view on the position
represents perfection and to accept it without question, but it is
unfailingly interesting and challenging for the opponent.} ) 12...Rxd1+
13.Qxd1 Qd8 14.Qxd8+ Nxd8 15.Be2 {Black has two
approaches in this position: quiet development with 15...Bd7, or the
more forceful 15...Nd5, which aims to achieve immediate liquidation. We
decided to take on AlphaZero from this position using some help from
engines where required.} ( 15.Na4 Bf8 16.Nab6 {is a surprising idea that
was first tried by Euwe in 1954 but seems insufficient for an
advantage:} 16...axb6 17.Nxb6 Ra5 18.Nxc8 Rc5 19.Nb6 g5 20.Bg3 Rc2

moves.} ) 15...Bd7 ( {AlphaZero likes} 15...Nd5 {less, moving to a solid
71_percent_ expected score for White:} 16.Nxd5 exd5 17.Nd6 Bd7 ( {the
favourite move of the engines, completing development before trying to
liquidate Black's isolated d-pawn with ...d5-d4. On} 17...d4 {White

White} ) 18...Bb6 19.0-0 19...Ne6 { (as Black, AlphaZero was
keener on plans with ...a5, to swap off as many pawns as possible) }

to a 75_percent_ expected score} ) 22.Bxc6 bxc6 23.Nc4 dxe3 24.fxe3 Ng5

engines were very happy with it, too.} 17.Rc1 Bf8 18.Bg3 Nd5 {Black
starts to exchange minor pieces.} 19.Na5 {Playing the knight to a5 is a
recurring plan in these positions. It makes Black's light-squared bishop
insecure and ties down a black piece to the defence of the b7-pawn. If
Black plays ...b6, then White gets some extra weak light squares to work
with.} 19...Nxc3 20.Rxc3 Bd5 21.f3 f6 22.e4 Ba2 {DIAGRAM ... and that's
why you need engines to help you! We were extremely nervous about this
move, but it seems crucial to keeping Black's position together.} 23.Kf1

24.Nc6 e5 25.Bf2 Be6 {Here AlphaZero's evaluation starts to drop from
68_percent_ evaluation to 62_percent_.} 26.Bb5 Bf7 27.Nxd8 Rxd8 28.Ke2
Bd6 29.Bc4 h5 30.b4 Bxc4+ 31.Rxc4 Kf8 32.a4 {AlphaZero's evaluation is
at a 66_percent_ expected score, but White's advantage feels manageable
for Black. All-in-all, Black's position is not fun to play - Black is
only playing for two results - but backed by some accurate computer
preparation (for example, a few ideas like 22...Ba2 in our main line)
Black should be able to count on navigating to an endgame in which
White's advantage probably cannot be realized.} *
