{Elajnov was half a point ahead of the field before the start of the eighth
round. He was up against Fabiano Caruana. The latter definitely would be
looking for blood as a win would mean, sole first spot.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3.
c4 e6 4. Nc3 dxc4 {The Vienna variation is not seen very often at the top
level, but it is provocative in nature and quite good when you are trying to
play for a full point.} 5. e3 (5. e4 {is much more active, but with a half
point lead Eljanov decides to keep it solid.}) 5... a6 6. a4 c5 7. Bxc4 { We
have now transposed into the Queen's Gambit Accepted territory.} Nc6 8. O-O Be7
9. Qe2 {White needs to develop his pieces and hence this move seems completely
logical. But because a6 and a4 have been added, Black can now win the pawn on
d4. The point of a6 being added is that the b5 square is covered and moves like
Nb5 or Bb5 will no longer be possible.} cxd4 10. Rd1 (10. exd4 Nxd4 11. Nxd4
Qxd4 {is fine for Black.}) 10... e5 11. exd4 exd4 12. Nxd4 Nxd4 13. Qe5 {This
is all well known theory. White is going to win back his piece, but overall it
seems highly unlikely that he can fight for an edge in this position.} Qd6 14.
Qxd4 Qxd4 15. Rxd4 Bc5 16. Rd1 (16. Rd3 {was tried by Koneru against Ju Wenjun
recently, but it doesn't change the evaluation of the position.}) 16... O-O 17.
h3 Be6 (17... Bf5 {is met with the strong} 18. Bd5 $1 {when it is not so easy
to defend the b7 pawn.}) 18. Bxe6 fxe6 {That's a common idea. The e6 pawn will
not be very weak. Meanwhile it was important to get rid of the important c4
bishop.} 19. Kf1 Nd5 20. f3 Nxc3 21. bxc3 Rac8 22. Rb1 b6 23. Re1 Rc6 24. Re4
Rd8 25. Bf4 Kf7 26. Be5 Rd2 27. Rg4 g6 28. Ke1 Rd5 ( 28... Ra2 29. Rd1 Ke7 30.
Rd2 $11) 29. Rf4+ Ke7 30. Re4 Bd6 31. Bd4 { Theoretically it was an excellent
result for Caruana, but judging from the tournament situation it was just what
Eljanov needed. He is now half point ahead with just one round to go!} 1/2-1/2
