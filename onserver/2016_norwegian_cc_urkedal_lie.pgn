25. Nxc5 {It seems that white has a good position a healthy pawn up.} e4 $1 {
Probably the best practial chance.} 26. Nxa6 {Urkedal plays concrete chess,
but while it certainly looks tempting to grab the exchange and probably is
good, the open b-file spells problems for the white king. Kjetil said that
after this move he felt that things were going his way.} (26. Ndxe4 $1) 26...
bxa6 27. c5 $1 {Vacating a square on c4.} e3 28. fxe3 Qa4 {As Sven
Wisløff-Nilssen, the known chess blogger and commentaror said it: "Out of
absolutely nothing GM Kjetil Lie has conjured up a dangerous attack.". In the
daily bulletin Wisløff-Nilssen refered to Lie as the "Mikhail Tal of
Porsgrunn (Lie´s home town)" and it´s hard to disagree. Even though the
computers seem to enjoy white´s position it is hard to play correctly.} 29.
Qc4 $4 {At first it is hard to believe that this seemingly logical and
innocent looking move actually loses on the spot.} (29. Nc4 {Given after the
game as the winning move, but it´s not clear at all.} Rb8 30. e4 Bxb2+ 31.

chess and pure magic.} 30. d6+ (30. Qxa4 Bxb2# {A beautiful mate.}) 30... Kf8
