1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 Ng8 $6 {Why not? A typical continuation for the first round of
an open in which the favorite immediately avoids a theoretical duel. However,
with best play White should have a theoretical advantage.} 3. d4 {Practically
White made three moves, Black none. However, White's advanced pawn on e5 is a
target that Black wants to attack.} d6 4. Nf3 Bg4 (4... dxe5 5. Nxe5 Nd7 {
appears to be more logical.} 6. Bd3 Ngf6 {Grandelius,N (2547)-Fries Nielsen,J 
(2411) Lund 2011} 7. O-O $1 $14 {A typical position in which White in slightly
better because he has more space and is better developed.}) 5. Be2 (5. h3 Bh5
6. e6 $5 fxe6 7. g4 Bg6 8. Ng5 $36 {Kotronias,V (2611)-Sandipan,C (2585)

Qa5 12. b4 $36) 8... Nd7 9. Nxd7 {(#)} O-O-O $1 {Probably the move White
overlooked. The white knight cannot move because of the mate on d1 which
allows Black to win the piece back and to keep an extra-pawn.} 10. Nc3 Rxd7 11.
Be3 a6 $1 {Very precise! Black protects the a-pawn and forces White's queen on
a worse square.} (11... Qg4 12. O-O e6 13. Rfd1 Rxd1+ 14. Rxd1 Nf6 15. Bxa7 $11
