{The 2013 Candidates tournament in London, had the most exciting denouement of
any tournament I can remember. The brilliant Norwegian Wunderkind Magnus
Carlsen, was eventually to stagger over the line, after a war of attrition and
nerves that will live in the memory for many years. But it was the Russian
Vladimir Kramnik who will perhaps feel most aggrieved - he did not lose a game
until the last round, a game we shall now analyse, and his chess was of a very
high quality indeed.  There are a lot of ifs and buts, but I would not
criticise the format. One player had to qualify, and if there had not existed
the tie-break format, and the tournament had gone to play-offs, perhaps you
would have had a much more cautious approach from the players, resulting in
the veritable bore-fest which was the previous candidates. Clearly this
tournament format is the way forward.} 1. d4 d6 2. e4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {Kramnik
essays the Pirc, a surprising choice you might think in such an important
encounter. But going into the game he must have felt that he needed to win, as
he could hardly have expected Carlsen to lose with White to Svidler, so
perhaps he felt that his normal repertoire was too solid, and that a sharper
game was needed. However I have little doubt that if such a situation were to
arise again, Kramnik would not choose this opening. Readers with a good memory,
may recall that the Pirc has a mixed success rate in last round games at the
world championship level. Famously, Korchnoi was to be thoroughly routed when
he chose this defence against Karpov in the decisive last game of their 1978
Baguio match. It is my belief that a player should stick with the approach
that has brought them to this point in the first place, and not change at the
last moment when on the brink of success. If you are a strategic and
positional player like Kramnik or Korchnoi, you should not play the Pirc, you
should stick to what you know, even if there is a danger that the game will be
too dry to play for a win. But that it is just my thought and I will never
play a match for the world championship!} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Be2 O-O 6. O-O a6 7. h3

decision, but it does create some weaknesses on the queenside, like the
c5-square for example.} ({Black might ideally like to play} 10... Nd7 {so that
he can recapture on e5 with a piece, but the problem is that this runs into}

forward to very good King's Indian style play, with ...Nh5 followed by ...f5

played h3, which just gives Black an additional target on the kingside.} 12.

harmoniously posted, while he can start to pester White with moves like ...Qa2.
}) 22... Bc6 {Around about here Kramnik already started to think about taking
over the initiative. One can only imagine the emotions raging through the
players at this point, with so much at stake. Did Kramnik need to play for a
win, or a draw? He was keeping a close eye on proceedings in the Carlsen
encounter, which perhaps distracted him from his own game.} 23. Ra5 Qb7 24. g3

Speelman enquired in the press conference afterwards, whether Kramnik had
considered the possibility of the sacrifice} 26... Nxe4 $5 $36 {Kramnik
replied that he had, but was unsure about this as it might just be losing.
However this is an excellent suggestion by the imaginative Speelman, as it
would have given Black superb practical chances. One can also see Kasparov
playing this way, but perhaps Kramnik found his usual instincts, to play solid,
positional chess, difficult to desert?} 27. Qxe4 f5 28. Qc4 Rad8 29. Be3 $1 ({
you see it is easy to go wrong here. At first I thought the simple} 29. Rd1 {

is he didn't know which result he should be playing for at this point, as it
wasn't clear yet that Carlsen was going to lose.} 31. Bxe6 (31. c3 Nxc5 32.

is balanced out by his queenside weaknesses and the superb bishop on c4}) 31...

Kramnik, but for me this is a very human reaction - Black is becoming slowly
squeezed, so it's human nature to want to grab some squares for his pieces.}

rematch with Vishy. Now Black just has a bad position, without even a pawn to
compensate for that.} ({One can only imagine that Kramnik refrained for the
seemingly natural continuation} 35... Rxa6 $1 36. Rxa6 Qxh4 37. Rxc6 {as
perhaps he felt that Black is only fighting for a draw here. But at least he
has some squares!} Ng5 38. Bxg5 ({The computer makes the suggestion} 38. Bxf7+

have played this way? I somehow doubt it.} Bf6 40. b6 Rd8 $13 {with the idea
of ...Rd1, where there is still everything to play for}) 38... Qxg5+ 39. Kf1

through, with similar gruesome results to the game.}) 36... Rc7 37. Bxe6 Rxe6
38. b5 $1 {A move that effectively ended Kramnik's brave challenge for another
two years, and ensured that the Norwegian Wunderkind Magnus Carlsen would
challenge Anand for the World title. White's threats are murderous.} Rb7 39. b6

been scant consolation for Vladimir, staring at the ruins of his position.} Qb8
