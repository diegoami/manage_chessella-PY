generation of chessplayers whose French studies were highlighted by the
superfamous game Reshevsky-Vaganian,Skopje 1976.Vaganian's authority on French
is undisputed and the opening unsurprisingly became an integral part of
armenian chess school.I simply could not let the opportunity pass without
asking Rafael some burning questions.White's move 7 is such a question.} b5 8.

True to his style Vaganian is not going to sit down and wait for white to grab
