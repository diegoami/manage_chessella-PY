high amount of time for his moves until now but the last one he played pretty

on e5 Nihal starts a serious of moves that are committal but give him a lot of
space in the position. Usually White doesn't like to clarify with dxe5 because
he is essentially exchanging his d4 pawn for the one on d6. But in this case
Nihal has a concrete idea in his mind.} (21. a5 exd4 (21... Nc4) 22. cxd4 Nc4

503 An excellent move by Nihal. He is now going to plae his bishop on b3 and
put more pressure on the f7 point. White is not just better here, but with
accurate play even close to winning!} Qd6 {1958 Black has to make this
uncomfortable move because he cannot move his knight from d7. It allows Bb6.}
