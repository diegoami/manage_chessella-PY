14. bxc3 Rd1+ 15. Ke2 e6 $44 {looks like excellent compensation.}) 11... Qxe5
$146 {Just a month ago Tomashevsky played this same opening against Postny in
the European Club Cup. But in that tournament he was White. It is possible that
he had prepared this novelty from the black side.} 12. Be2 (12. Rc1 $5) 12...
Qd6 13. Qxb7 Rb8 14. Qa7 (14. Qxa6 Qxa6 15. Bxa6 Rxb2 $11) 14... Rxb2 15. Bd1
$1 {Bacrot finds this interesting idea of trapping the rook on b2 with Bb3. The
rook cannot really retreat as Ba4+ is quite a strong threat.} f6 (15... Rb8 16.
Ba4+ $18) 16. Bb3 Bc2 17. Qd4 Bxb3 18. Qxb2 Bc4 {For an exchange Black has a
pawn and has prevented White from castling. However, one gets the feeling that
White should have an edge here because he can safeguard his king with f3 Kf2.}
19. Rb1 Kf7 20. f3 g6 21. a4 Bg7 22. Qb4 Qe5 (22... Qd7 23. Kf2 Rc8 { might
have been a better way to continue.}) 23. Kf2 Bd3 24. Bc3 Qf5 25. Rbd1 h5 26.
Qd4 {Over the last few moves White has consolidated his position while Black
has been unable to get his pieces into action. The rook on h8 is also quite
passive. White is clearly better.} Bc2 (26... Bc4 27. e4 $1 $16) 27. Qxd5+ Qxd5
28. Rxd5 Bxa4 29. Rc1 $16 {Black faces a thankless defensive task ahead of
him.} Rb8 30. Rc5 Rb6 31. Rc7 Re6 32. h4 Bb5 33. Bd4 Bf8 34. Ra7 Rd6 35. Rcc7
Re6 36. e4 Bd3 37. Rc8 Bg7 38. Rc3 Bb5 39. Rcc7 Bh6 40. g3 Bf8 41. Ra8 Bg7 42.
Rb8 Bf8 43. Rb6 Rxb6 44. Bxb6 {The exchange of rooks is definitely progress for
White, who can now use his king in the attack.} Ke6 45. f4 Bd3 46. Ke3 Bf1 47.
Bc5 Kf7 48. Rc8 Bh3 49. Ra8 Bf1 50. Kd4 Be2 51. Rb8 Bf1 52. Kd5 $6 {This
results in the loss of the e4 pawn and we reach the fortress that we have seen
in the diagram above the game. Bacrot could have tried converting his advantage
in a better way.} (52. Rb6 Be2 53. e5 $5 fxe5+ 54. fxe5 Bg7 55. Rb7 Bf8 56. Bb4
Bf1 57. Rb6 Bg7 58. Bd2 Be2 59. Bg5 Bf1 60. Rb7 Bf8 61. Rb2 ( 61. Kc5 Ke6)

Bg4 64. Rxa5 {Now this position is an entirely different matter. I am convinced
that White will be able to break this blockade. Although the specifics will
have to be worked out I think it will include forcing Black to play e7-e6 and
then exchanging the dark squared bishops. The resulting rook vs bishop will be
no fortress.}) 52... Bg2 53. Rb2 e6+ 54. Kc4 Bxe4 55. Bxf8 Kxf8 56. Kd4 Bf5
{Tomashevsky has seen that he will lose both his e6 and a6 pawns but will still
be able to draw the game.} 57. Rb7 Bg4 58. Ra7 Bf5 59. Rxa6 Ke7 60. Rb6 Kf7 61.

Kf7 (67... Bxe6 $2 68. Kxe6 $18 {is a lost pawn endgame.}) 68. Re7+ Kf8 69. Rc7
Bh3 70. Rc1 Kf7 71. Re1 Bg4 {A very pretty and at the same time impregnable
fortress.} 1/2-1/2
