{This was the most important game of the round - two of the leaders faced each
other. I'm sure Leko was okay with a draw, but the ambitious Vidit played for
a win, and got it after a long struggle.} 1. c4 {Slightly surprising to me, as
Vidit sticks to 1.d4 in the majority of his games. In fact, 1.c4 is even rarer
than 1.e4 as far as Vidit's choices are concerned! This must have been a
little unsettling for Leko.} c5 {The Symmetrical English is not something to
be used when playing for a win as Black, as White has numerous options to
force equality. But as previously stated, Leko must have been happy to share
the point.} 2. g3 {This move order is fast becoming topical, thanks to the
efforts of the opening expert Mihail Marin.} g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 d6
6. O-O Rb8 $5 {A mildly offbeat choice by Peter. Was he was out of prep
already? Or did he want to take Vidit into unknown waters and then outplay
him? This has been tried by numerous IMs, but the fact that the highest rated
player to take Black in this position is rated 2507 must mean there is a
reason the top guys haven't tried it.} (6... Qd7 7. e3 Bxc3 8. bxc3 f5 {
was the choice of a younger Magnus Carlsen in Nakamura,H (2775)-Carlsen,M 
(2835) Moscow 2012 but here White can go for} 9. e4 $1 fxe4 10. Ng5 Qg4 11.
Nxe4 {with a better endgame after} Qxd1 12. Rxd1 Bf5 13. d4 $16) (6... Bg4 7.
h3 (7. a3 $5 {has been White's best scoring move in the position, though I
don't really find it very impressive.} Qd7 8. Rb1 (8. d3 {seems safer.}) 8...
Bh3 (8... h5 $1 9. b4 h4 $15 {and Black starts his attack much faster than
White.}) 9. b4 cxb4 10. axb4 h5 11. Bxh3 Qxh3 12. Nd5 $14 {was Cvek,R (2525)
-Zwardon,V (2413) Czech Republic 2016. Here White is slightly better, and he
managed to win, but the variation in itself seems playable for Black.}) 7...
Bd7 8. d3 Qc8 9. Kh2 h5 10. Bg5 h4 $13 {gives complex play. Again, Black seems
okay to me.}) (6... Bf5 7. h3 Nf6 8. d3 O-O 9. Be3 {was Carlsen,M (2845)
-Vachier Lagrave,M (2773) Karlsruhe/Baden Baden 2019, and here Black should
start his counterplay with} Qc8 $1 10. Kh2 h6 11. a3 g5 $13 {with an unclear
middlegame.}) 7. a3 a6 8. Rb1 (8. b4 $5 {immediately was interesting as well.
The pawn sacrifice is objectively correct, and after} cxb4 (8... Bxc3 $2 9.
dxc3 Nf6 {is met with the strong} 10. bxc5 $1 dxc5 11. Bf4 Qxd1 12. Rfxd1 Ra8
13. Rab1 $16 {with a terrifying bind on the Black position.}) 9. axb4 Nxb4 10.
d4 Nc6 11. Bb2 Bd7 (11... Bg4 12. d5 Bxf3 13. exf3 $1 Ne5 14. Qe2 {with a
wonderful position for White.}) 12. e4 $14 {and White's superb pieces give him
more than enough compensation for the pawn.}) 8... b5 9. cxb5 axb5 10. b4 cxb4
11. axb4 $14 {I remember Bent Larsen commenting on one of his games ( which
had a similar structure) that White's position is easier to play despite the
symmetry. I agree with him, and feel Black has a few issues to solve.} Nf6 {
The start of Black's problems stem from this natural move.} (11... e5 $5 {
is the computer recommendation in this variation. Black grabs space in the
center, and in order to make use of his development White has to play
energetically.} 12. d4 $1 exd4 $1 {Black has to walk a tightrope to survive.} (
12... Nxd4 $6 13. Nxd4 exd4 14. Nd5 Be6 (14... Nf6 15. Qxd4 $16 {is even worse
- White now has a clear target to attack.}) 15. Bb2 Ne7 16. Bxd4 Be5 17. Nf6+
$16 {and Black either loses the bishop pair or his castling rights. White is
better.}) 13. Bg5 Qd7 (13... f6 {is horrible.} 14. Nxd4 $1 $18 {and White wins
material.}) 14. Nd5 h6 15. Bc1 Nge7 16. Nxe7 Qxe7 17. Bb2 O-O 18. Nxd4 Ne5 {
and now} 19. Ra1 $14 {gives White a small advantage due to the permanent
weakness of the d5 pawn. The engines feel this is defensible, but I wouldn't
advise a human to play like this.}) (11... Bf5 $1 {was safer, provoking} 12. e4
Bg4 13. Ne2 e5 14. h3 Bxf3 15. Bxf3 Nge7 $14 {White might be slightly better,
but Black is not without his chances.}) 12. d4 $1 {Now White starts to get all
the fun. It is really surprising how in a symmetrical position one innacuracy
causes a lot of pain.} Bf5 13. Rb3 {I'm surprised a player of Vidit's caliber
didn't look for tactical solutions.} (13. d5 $3 {Is a fine exchange sacrifice.
White's point is revealed after} Bxb1 14. dxc6 Bf5 15. Nd4 $16 {The c-pawn is
super strong and can't easily be won. The b5 pawn will soon fall, granting
White connected passers. The knights are very nimble in this position, while
the rooks lack open files. All in all the position seems very difficult for
Black, perhaps even practically lost. Granted it is easier to analyse such
positions at home and understand the compensation, but the nature of Black's
development must have prompted India's no 3 to look such sacrifices.}) 13... d5
14. Ne5 Qb6 15. Be3 Be6 16. Nd3 O-O 17. Nc5 $16 {White is definitely much
better here. He controls a lot of squares, and despite the symmetry Black is
struggling to place his places due to his poor development. Who knew the value
of one tempo is this high! One more thing to note here is that while White's
knight on c5 is super strong, the black knight on f6 is preventing his
counterplay. This is a very important factor.} Rfd8 18. Ra3 Ra8 19. Rxa8 Rxa8
20. Qb3 {The rook on a8 is hitting nothing - looking beautiful is not enough!
The weakness of the b5 and d5 pawns is significant, while the pawns on b4 and
d4 are more difficult to attack. Here the best option for Black was to wait,
but it is so difficult to do in practice that I find it hard to criticize
Peter's next move.} Qd8 (20... h6 $5 {Black passes the move to White and asks
him to create something.} 21. h4 $1 {White does the same, while also
preventing any g5 breaks.} Rd8 22. Ra1 {Already the first concession has been
made - Black loses the a-file. Only now do the engines begin to understand
that Black must lose a pawn. Now after} Bc8 (22... Ne4 $2 {Tactics in a worse
position usually land you in trouble.} 23. N3xe4 $1 Nxd4 24. Bxd4 Bxd4 25. Ra6
$1 dxe4 26. Nxe6 $1 Bxf2+ 27. Kh2 Qxa6 28. Nxd8 {and White wins a piece.}) (
22... Kh7 {this is not an option} 23. Ra6 $18 {and White soon wins.}) 23. Nxd5
Nxd5 24. Bxd5 e6 25. Bxc6 Qxc6 26. Ra7 $16 {the win is only a matter of time.})
21. Rc1 $1 $18 {Improving the last piece. It will soon be clear why the rook
is best on c1 - once the knights are cleared from the c-file it is ideally
placed.} Rc8 {Vidit becomes a computer for the next few moves!} 22. Nxb5 Qb6
23. Nxe6 fxe6 24. Bh3 Kf7 25. Rc5 Ra8 26. Bf4 Nd8 27. Bc7 Qb7 28. Qf3 Bh6 29.
Be5 Bg7 30. Kg2 h5 {The last few moves have been the most precise! White's
advantage has grown to gigantic propotions. It is time to cash in.} 31. g4 $1 {
Opening the position further.} (31. Nc7 $1 {was another way to finish things.
The idea is to temporarily sacrifice a piece after} Ra2 32. Rb5 Qa7 33. Nxe6 $1
Nxe6 34. Bxe6+ Kxe6 35. Bxf6 $18 {and Black can't take back due to mate on d5.
This sequence wins another pawn, and Leko would have surely resigned here.})
31... hxg4 32. Bxg4 Ra4 33. Qb3 $6 {After playing superb chess for 32 moves,
Vidit starts to give away half chances. GMs are human after all!} (33. Bc7 $1 {
was best, threatening to eliminate the key defender. Now after} Ra8 34. Qf4 Nc6
35. Be5 Rh8 36. Nc7 Nd8 37. b5 $18 {White wins on a canter.}) 33... Ra6 34.
Bxf6 Bxf6 35. e3 Rb6 36. Be2 $6 {Time trouble is probably taking its toll. A
second innacuracy greatly reduces White's advantage.} (36. Qd3 $1 {was correct,
activating the queen and threatening the weak pawns on the kingside. White
should convert after} Kg7 37. Nc7 $1 Rc6 38. Ne8+ Kf7 39. Nxf6 exf6 40. b5 $1
$18) 36... Nc6 37. Qa4 {White's advantage has diminished to managable levels.}
Kg7 $6 {Now it's Leko's turn to return the favour!} (37... Qb8 $5 {Asks White
to win it himself. Play can now go} 38. Qb3 Kg7 39. Qc3 Qb7 40. f4 Qa6 $16 {
and nothing decisive is happening immediately.}) 38. f4 $6 (38. Nc3 $1 {
forces Black to sacrifice a piece with} Nxd4 (38... Nxb4 39. Qe8) 39. exd4 Bxd4
{if he is to survive, but if White is accurate with} 40. Nb5 $1 Ra6 41. Rc7 $1
{Black has nothing better than} Rxa4 42. Rxb7 Rxb4 43. Rxe7+ Kf6 44. Nxd4 Rxd4
45. Ra7 $18 {where the loss is a matter of when rather than if.}) 38... Ra6 39.
Qb3 Rb6 40. Bd3 Na7 $2 {Just after the time control Peter blunders into a
combination.} (40... Qd7 {and White still has a hard road to victory.}) 41. Nc7
$1 Rxb4 42. Nxe6+ $6 {Slightly innacurate.} (42. Qd1 $1 {and Black is busted -}
Rb2+ 43. Bc2 Qb3 44. Kf3 Qa3 45. Nxe6+ Kf7 46. f5 $1 $18 {and White's mating
attack forces Black to give up material.}) 42... Kf7 43. Nd8+ Kg7 44. Qxd5
Qxd5+ 45. Rxd5 $18 {With two pawns the ending is won despite the opposite
coloured bishops.} Rb3 46. Ne6+ Kh6 47. Nc5 Rb2+ 48. Kg3 Nc6 49. Rd7 Nb4 50.
Bc4 Nc2 51. Nd3 {All of Vidit's pieces are on their best squares.} Rb1 52. Kf3

Rf8+ 59. Rf6+ $1 {wite wins a piece and will remain a pawn up. So Leko
resigned. A wonderful technical display by Vidit.} 1-0
