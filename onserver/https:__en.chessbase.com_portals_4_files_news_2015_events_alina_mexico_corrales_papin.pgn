{Kudos for the Cuban female player, who showed great class in her next 15
moves, handing the Russian GM no chances to survive! This cost loads of time
though and when the players had to perform on the 30 seconds increament,
things went astray for White...  But let's have eyes for the beautiful plan
found by Zenia in this position.} 21. Rd3 $1 Kf8 {Black has to do something to
avoid the upcoming missiles. After the game, Vasily admitted he didn't expect
that White's idea could be so poisonous.} 22. Rg3 h6 23. Rff3 $1 {I am
personally very fond of these rook moves.} d5 {After deep thought, the Russian
decided to go for the chaos, hoping that he will get his chances in the mutual
time trouble.} 24. Rxg7 $1 {For a chess player, making such moves on the board
is a true delight:)} Kxg7 25. Rg3+ Kf8 26. Qxf6 Qd6 27. Qg7+ Ke8 28. exd5 {
Preparing the way for the knight to e4; she made one strong move after another!
} Qf8 {What else?!} 29. Qxe5+ Qe7 30. Qd4 Kd7 31. Re3 Qf8 32. Ne4 Kc7 33. Rc3+
Kb8 34. Qb6 {choices choices choices... I smile everytime I remember Donner's
indignation: "I love all positions. Give me a difficult positional game, I'll
play it. Give me a bad position, I'll defend it. Openings, endgames,
complicated positions, and dull, drawn positions, I love them all and will
give my best efforts. But totally winning positions I cannot stand." There is
nothing more annoying than not winning a winning game and even more so, to
eventually lose it. This is the starting point of White's hesitation, when the
little time left caused her defeat.} (34. d6 {would create the winning
mechanism, pinning Black from all the sides.} Bxe4 (34... Qe8 35. Bf3 Ra7 36.
Qb6) 35. Qb6+ Bb7 36. Bf3 Ra7 37. Rc7) 34... Ra7 35. Bf3 {This doesn't spoil
anything, as after Black's answer White has a winning continuation.} (35. d6 {
is again possible} Ka8 36. Rc7) 35... Rxd5 36. h3 {A typical move in time
scramble, just to avoid any kind of mate but it deprived Zenia from a deserved
point.} (36. Nf6 {would have won on the spot, because after} Qe7 37. Nxd5 Qe1+
{White has} 38. Qg1 {and a piece up.}) 36... Qd8 37. Qxh6 Bc8 38. Qf4+ Rc7 39.
f6 Rf5 40. Qg3 Rd5 41. Ng5 Rd6 42. Re3 Rxf6 43. a4 bxa4 {There is little point
in analyzing the remaining moves, since White's strength was dramatically
influenced by the ticking seconds. However, the Cuban has all the reasons to
be proud of her middlegame play!} 0-1
