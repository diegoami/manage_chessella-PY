Nh5 9. Bg3 {[#]} f5 $5 {A bold approach by Black, but after this he needs to
follow up very accurately, as he is also creating some weaknesses on the
kingside.} 10. Be2 O-O 11. Rd1 $5 (11. O-O-O {runs into} b5 $1 {which might
well be good for White- but you have a practical headache at least.}) 11...
Nxg3 12. hxg3 g6 (12... Qc7 $2 13. g4 $1) 13. a3 Be7 $1 {A prophylatic measure
against White's idea of playing b4. As I stated earlier in the tournament
during the commentary, (and if you want to watch replays of this I suggest you
check out the ginger gm twitch channel) Keith will generally play at least 2-3
high-class positional moves over the course of the game.} 14. e4 $1 {A very
testing move to meet. White wants to blow up the position before Black is
fully mobilised.} Rf7 (14... f4 15. gxf4 Rxf4 {probably doesn't solve all the
issues either, as later White may switch the queen to d2, eyeing up
penetration with Qh6.}) 15. exf5 gxf5 $2 {This leaves Black's position rather
static and vulnerable to g4 and Nd5 prods.} (15... Rxf5 16. Bd3 Rf7 {was the
way to go}) 16. Bd3 Rg7 {[#]} 17. Nd5 $1 {Very alert from David.} b6 {Keith
doesn't panic.} (17... exd5 18. cxd5 Na7 19. Bxf5 {and White's attack is too
obvious.}) 18. Kf1 Rb8 19. b4 ({The Tal like} 19. g4 Rxg4 20. Ne3 $1 {[#]
would have given a ferocious attack.} Rg7 21. Nxf5 exf5 22. Bxf5 Bf6 23. Bxh7+
Kf8 24. Rh6 $1) 19... Qf8 20. Ne3 (20. Nf4 $5) 20... Qf6 21. Re1 d6 22. g4 $1 {
It is never too late to play a strong idea! White should have played it
earlier, but this still gives Black severe practical problems to solve over
the board.} fxg4 23. Bxh7+ Kf7 24. Nd2 Nd4 $6 (24... g3 $1 25. Ne4 Qf4 26. Rh3
$1 {was the engines suggestion, although this also looks very complex and hard
to find.}) 25. Qd1 Bb7 26. Be4 g3 27. Qh5+ Kf8 28. f3 {[#]} Rg5 {Both players
were in time trouble around about this point, and the computer evaluation
varies wildly with every move.} ({Black had an opportunity to force the draw
with the almost impossible to find shot} 28... Nb3 $3 29. Nxb3 (29. Qh8+ Kf7

Qxg3 Nf5 36. Qf2 $6 (36. Bxf5 Rxf5 (36... exf5 37. Qf4) 37. Ne4 {was probably
simpler, when White keeps a decisive edge.}) 36... Bd7 $1 37. Rh3 Kf7 38. Bd3
Rh8 39. Ne4 $2 (39. Rxh8 Qxh8 40. Bxf5 exf5 41. Rxe7+ Kxe7 42. Qe3+ {was not
obvious to see in time trouble.}) 39... Rgh5 $1 40. Rxh5 Rxh5 {[#] Possibly
Keith had outplayed David over the last few moves from a lost position, so
it's impressive now how David retains his composure and keeps trying to find
the best moves.  As Keith said after the game, David had to win the game again,
but you can't have any complaints about that, because that's exactly what we
do to lower rated players as well.} 41. g3 $1 Nd4 (41... Rh1+ 42. Kg2 Rxe1 43.
Qxe1 Qb2+ {at first glance looks like it solves Black's problems, until you
take the variation further and see that after} 44. Nef2 Qxa3 45. Qe4 {White
retains a powerful initiative.} Qxb4 $2 46. Nh6+ $1 $18) 42. Kg2 Qh8 (42... Bc6

This feels like extreme fatigue at the end of a long tournament, because
surely the only chance is to keep queens on, but it's already become apparent
that White has reasserted control.} 55. fxe4 Nd4 56. Rb1 Bd8 57. Rb8 Rh8 58.
