{This study (winning the 3rd prize in the "Israel Ring tourney" 1980, a
tourney in which all endgame study columns in Israel chess magazines
participate - to my knowledge from a few years ago only those in Shahmat and
Variantim exist nowadays) is commented by Afek in Variantim: "White [with]
huge material advantage is in danger. A vigorous action is called for." It is
easy to see that White can draw easily, but how can he win facing the threat
of K:a6? So: White to move and win! First White forces the bishop to move,
winning a tempo. But it is not yet clear what is the plan.} 1. Nc3 Bc6 {Black
protects a4, but White has a tactical trick that allows him to sacrifice the
knight and apparently win easily by promotion.} 2. Na4+ Bxa4 {Maybe now the
conundrum is visible. Black can always win the queen if White promotes. Black
just takes the bishop on a6 and then gives a check on c6. However, White has a
trick.} ({If Black takes, White protects everything and wins with bishop and
knight, for example} 2... Kxa6 3. Nc5+ Kb6 4. Ba7+ Kc7 5. Na6+ Kd6 {and after
these only winning moves, White has multiple winning moves. He can either give
a check first or directly stop the pawn:} 6. Bd4 $18) 3. Bb5 $1 Bxb5 {What has
changed? Black still will go to a6 and then give the check on c6 if White
promotes to a queen.} ({It is important to note that} 3... Kxb5 4. Ka7 $3 $18 {
wins, as White will promote with a skewer. Example line:} b2 5. Be5 b1=Q 6.
b8=Q+ $18) 4. Bc7+ Ka6 {As I said, if White promotes to a queen. There is, of
course, nothing that enforces this. I will not get into the semantics here if..
.} 5. b8=N# {...is an underpromotion or not, as the knight just so happens to
attack a6 while the queen wouldn't. Now we can see that this is actually a
logical study (in the problem terminus). The thematic try would be 3.Bc7+ Ka6
4.b8N+, failing to 4.-Kb5. By sacrificing the bishop on b5 Black has to defend
by blocking the square, preventing the king from escaping. The authors, of
course, presented it as an endgame study where this detail would be mentioned
nowa days but not nearly fourty years ago. Interested readers will be able to
read an article on study theory next month. Breaking the usual format, I will
present some studies - mostly from contemporary composers - with thematic
wrong tries in this column.} (5. b8=Q $2 Bc6+ $11 {is merely the Q.E.D. now.})

{The position stems from an earlier study of Aloni (Tijdschrift van den KNSB,
December 1959) that had not the pawn on b5 (or g7, see below). There was a
surprise draw to be avoided to win. Originally it was published with exchanged
colors there, but in this one move longer version also reprinted with these
colors in the L'Italia Scacchistica as a twin study to this one. With Pb5, the
position can be held: White to move and draw.} 1. Bxe7+ Kxe7 2. Rxg7+ (2. Re3
$2 Rxd7 3. Rxe4+ Kf6) 2... Kd8 3. Rg8+ Kxd7 4. Rg7+ Kc8 $1 {Giving perpetual
check on g7 and g8 won't work as the knight can interfere, so White must trade
rooks:} (4... Kd6 5. Rxb7 Bxb7+ 6. Kxb7 $11 ({The original study (without Pb5)
had} 6. Kxa7 {(here a draw also) which featured the draw after} Kc7 $11 {as
thematic try, as without Pb5 the solution was Kc6, winning. Adding the pawn
enabled additional stalemate ideas, as seen in the main variation.})) 5. Rxb7
Bxb7+ 6. Kxa7 Nd7 (6... Kc7 $11) 7. b6 Bd5 {(Black again avoids stalemate that
would happen if the knight moves to any other square than b6)} 8. b7+ Kc7 (8...
Bxb7 $11) 9. b8=Q+ Nxb8 {and Black is forced to stalemate. While the play is
forced, it still has a certain humor with the multiple stalemate ideas.  Sadly
bPg7 had to be added to the initial position to avoid a dual, the correction
by Mario Guido Garcia appeared in Estudios Artisticos de Ajedrez 2015.} 1/2-1/2

to see the objective here being fulfilled: White to move and win.} 1. h5 $1

bishop loses to a fork:} 1... Nxe8 2. h6 Nd6 3. h7 Nf7 4. Nh6+ $1 $18) {Taking

2017 spawned beautiful study, including a winner by Gady Costeff where two
