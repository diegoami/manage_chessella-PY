7. Nbd2 {Caruana had earlier gone for 7.h3 in Malmo 2012 against Giri!
Four years later, both are players have become super strong and we are
sure to see many more battles in the years to come.} (7. h3 Ne7 8. d4

Bh5 {All this was seen in the game Anand-Topalov from the first round
of the Candidates 2016. Anand went 12. a4 in this position. Caruana prefers
to break the pin immediately and plays Qb3.} 12. Qb3 d5 {Recently Caruana
himself played this with Topalov in Sinquefeld Cup 2015 and won a nice
game. Its important to note though he won with black he still chose to
play this line from white. This shows that the top players analyze their
games objectively and make use of any new ideas that they come across,
especially in their own games.} 13. e5 Nd7 14. Qd1 {[%cal Gd1b3,Gb3d1]
What's going on?!! Qd1-b3-d1? Is Caruana our of his mind? Not really!
Things in the centre are settled now and the queen doesn't mind this backward
move, mainly vacating the b3 square for the knight.} f6 $5 { Immediately
challenging the center. As Giri said during the press conference, he thought
that this line was fine for Black, but after the game he thinks that his
seconds somehow had underestimated the dangers in the position.} 15. e6
Nb8 {Undeveloping moves seem to be the order of the day. However, to be
fair, the knight simply didn't have a good square to go to.} 16. Nb3 {Eyeing
for the c5 outpost which would force Black to part with his dark squared
bishop. At the same time the route for the bishop to develop on d6 has
been opened.} Qd6 (16... Nbc6 {was possible but it seems as if Anish wanted
to prevent his opponent from going Bf4.}) 17. g4 Bg6 18. Nh4 Nbc6 19.
Bxc6 (19. Nxg6 Nxg6 {looks fine for Black.}) (19. Ng2 {preparing Bf4 can
be an option, but Black has a strong move in the form of} f5 $1 20. Bf4
Qb4 21. Bxc6 Nxc6 $11 ) 19... Qxc6 (19... bxc6 20. Ng2 {is now a clearly
better position for White as Bf4 is threatened and there is no bishop
to attack on b5 with Qb4.} f5 21. Bf4 Qb4 22. a3 Qa4 23. g5 $16 {Black
is left without any countrplay.}) 20. Bd2 {White is ready to give up the
d4 pawn in order to get good amount of piece activity.} (20. Bf4 {is natural
but it always seems dangerous to put a piece where a pawn fork can happen.
In this case the move g7-g5.} Bc2 21. Qd2 Bxb3 22. axb3 g5 23. Bxg5 fxg5
24. Qxg5+ Kh8 {Giri showed some blistering analysis in this position.
One of the lines that was very entertaining was the following.} 25. Qe5+
Kg8 26. Nf5 Nxf5 27. gxf5 Qd6 28. f6 Qxe5 29. dxe5 $16 { [%csl Ge5,Ge6,Gf6]
Anish gave us an example of four rows of pawns (32 pawns!) vs all the
other pieces. Truly wonderful the kind of thing these top players like
to indulge in!}) 20... Bc2 21. Qe2 Bxb3 22. axb3 Bxd4 {Although Black
has won a pawn, it doesn't really matter. The pawn on e6 is a monster
and the rook on a1 is also activated without any efforts. Giri has to
play carefully here.} 23. Bb4 Bc5 (23... Rfe8 $2 24. Bxe7 Rxe7 25. Nf5

have been even stronger.}) 26... Qb7 27. Rxc5 Rfe8 28. Qb5 {It was possible
to play more aggressively, but Caruana had already spent a lot of his
thinking time and hence decided it was safer to simplify the game.} (28.

Black's position. It will create threats and give him the necessary
counterplay.}
30. Nf5 (30. f4 {looks natural.} Rad8 31. Nf3 d3 32. Nd2 {This was Vladimir
Kramnik's suggestion. White threatens f5 now, so Black must do something
about it.} f5 $1 33. gxf5 (33. Kf2 {looks stronger but after} Rd5 {it
should nevertheless be around equal.}) 33... Rd5 34. Rxd5 Nxd5 35. Rxa7

game where we could have seen even more fireworks had Caruana not been
under time pressure.} 1/2-1/2
