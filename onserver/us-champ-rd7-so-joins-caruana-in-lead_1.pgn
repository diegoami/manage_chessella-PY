{You can never count Nakamura out of the title contention. He wins games, and
that puts a lot of pressure on his rivals, even when they have a huge 1.5 point
lead in the standings. With 4 more rounds to go, Naka is only trailing by one
point, let's see how he finished his strong opponent today. } 1.e4 e5 { an
early surprise by Akobian. He is an expert in the French but hasn't played e5
since his early teens days. } 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Be7
7.O-O Nc6 8.c4 Nb4 9.Be2 O-O 10.Nc3 Bf5 11.a3 Nxc3 12.bxc3 Nc6 13.Re1 Re8 { up
to this point the players are following one of the oldest and most analyzed
variations of the Petroff } 14.Ra2!? {a very rare move, one that has been
analyzed by the duo Nakamura-Sam Shankland during the 2014 Tromso Olympiad }
14...Na5 15.cxd5 Qxd5 16.Rb2 c6 { the correct response by Akobian. Despite the
bad score for white, this line has a tremendous amount of venom and will surely
be seen at top level in future games } ( 16...a6 17.Ne5 Bxa3 18.Bf3 Qd6 19.Rbe2

19.Rbe2 Bxc1 20.Qxc1 Be6 21.Be4 { black is a pawn up but it is very difficult
to coordinate your pieces. The K on a5 is completely out of the game and
white's attack on the kingside will become extremely acute in no time }

leading to a draw, I am convinced that Naka had some peculiar trumps in his
preparation } ) 24.dxe5 Qc5 25.Qc1 Rad8 26.Qg5 { white maintains a strong
initiative and I have a feeling the American's number two had something up his
sleeves } ) 22.Qb1 g6 23.f4! { now the attack becomes irresistible } 23...c5 (
23...f5 24.Bd3 Kg7 ( 24...c5 25.Nc4 ) 25.g4 ) 24.f5 cxd4? { missing white's
main resource } ( 24...Bb3 { was an interesting try but white had an incredible
move to get a good advantage } 25.Bd3! cxd4 ( 25...Rf8 26.Qc1! cxd4 ( 26...Kg7
