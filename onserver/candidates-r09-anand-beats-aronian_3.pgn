favourite move rather than 8...Bb7 that he played against Anand.} b4 9. d3 h6

Nb4 17. Ba3 d5 {17...c5 would be the natural way to play, but Svidler wanted to
go for the other central break with d5. He was fine with the positions after
e5, but missed or underestimated his opponent's next move.} 18. Ne5 $1 { [%cal
