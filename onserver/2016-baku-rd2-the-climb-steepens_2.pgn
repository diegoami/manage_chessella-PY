1. d4 {(0s) Today, we have another fine game from the uncompromising, smart,
and creative Czech Super-GM, David Navara.} Nf6  2. c4  e6  3. Nc3  Bb4  4. e3 
O-O  5. Bd3  d5  6. cxd5  exd5  7. Nge2 {(12s) Not long ago this year, Navara
lost a crucial game in European championship to Inarkiev, in the very same
line.} Re8  8. O-O  Bd6  (8... Bf8 {was Inarkiev's choice, and we will not get
to see Navara's improvement is...at least this time!} 9. Bd2 b6 10. Nf4 Bb7 11.

9. Bd2  a6  10. Rc1  b6 {(347s) Stefansson, follows Inarkiev's idea, with the
difference of having his bishop on d6.} 11. Ng3 $1  c5  12. Bb1 {(779s) Now it
is clear why the bishop is better on f8: in case of Nf5, the bishop on d6 will
not be under attack and Black can parry any attack on the kingside by means of
g6.} Be6  13. dxc5  Bxc5  14. Nce2 {(668s) This is not one of those 'isolated'
d-pawns. Black's pieces are not correctly placed and his a6-b6 pawns moves are
just permanent weaknesses.} Nbd7  15. Bc3  Bd6  16. Nd4  Rc8  17. Qe2  b5  18.
Nxe6  fxe6  19. e4  Bf4 $6 {(363s) There is no need for this provocative move.
Be5 directly could help Black neutralize White's edge.} (19... Be5) 20. Rce1 
Be5  21. Bxe5  Nxe5  22. f4 $1 {(85s) The key! Now White has all of his pieces
mobalized for a kingside attack. The bishop on b1 will turn into a monster very
soon.} Qb6+ $2 {(53s) This just makes things worse.} 23. Kh1  Ng6  24. e5  Nd7 
25. Qh5  Ndf8  26. f5 {(8s) It is all over now} exf5  27. Nxf5  Rcd8  28. Nd6 
Re6  29. Qf3  Nxe5  30. Rxe5 $1 {(15s) An elegant finish!} Qxd6  31. Qf7+  Kh8 
32. Rxd5 $1 {(10s) A crushing victory for Navara. Although, we should admit
that Stefansson did really make only one mistake, nevertheless it was enough
for Navara to wrap up the game convincingly. With this win, Navara sealed the
deal in Czech's favor 3-1 against Iceland!} 1-0
