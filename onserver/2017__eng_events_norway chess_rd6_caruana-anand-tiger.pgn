1. c4 {This is rare occurance for Caruana who usually starts out with 1.e4.} ({
It is worth comparing what happens in the game with the not purely fictional
line:} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 d6 7. Nf3

will arise later in this game, but with Black to move.} (10... e4 $1)) 1... e5
{I have heard GM:s saying that the problem with the English is - in order - 1..
.e5, 1...c5 and 1...e6, and then there is nothing wrong with 1...Nf6 or 1...c6.
Further down on the list 1...b6 and 1...g6 argues about which one is the most
respectable.} 2. Nc3 ({When Mihail Marin wrote his wonderful books on the
English, he chose to recommend} 2. g3 {as the second move here. The only
downside to leaving out Nc3, is that Black can play the immediate} c6 3. d4 (3.
Nf3 e4 {is another fashionable possibility.}) 3... e4 $5 4. Nc3 d5 {and Black
seems to be doing fine. One sample line is}) 2... Bb4 $5 ({Another Bb4-line
arises after} 2... Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 {This line was already at the
center of attention in the classic Wch match between Kasparov and Karpov, in
1987. Their 2:nd and 4:th game (with Kasparov as White) both went} (4... d5 5.

has been scoring very well here and Caruana was able to score a nice win
against Anand in the Moscow Candidates 2016 (a game that has been excellently
commented on in CBM by Mihail Marin). He was possibly hoping to repeat this
line.} exf3 10. Nxf3 d5 11. d4 dxc4 12. Qc2 h6 13. Bf4 Ne4 14. Rad1 Bf5 15. Ne5

well organized to deal with any central set-up that White might choose. The
knight is more flexible on e7 than on f6 and it is a good reason to try Bb4
before Nf6.}) 3... Bc5 (3... Be7 $5 4. d4 (4. g3) 4... d6 5. e4 Nf6 6. Nxe7
Qxe7 7. f3 exd4 8. Qxd4 Nc6 {is another insteresting line, where White has to
decide where the queen is best placed. 9.Qc3 seems to be the consensus, but in
a game against Ginger GM in 2015 I came to the conclusion that e3 looked like
a better square:} 9. Qe3 O-O 10. Ne2 {[%cal Ge2c3] This is why I didn't want
my queen on c3.} a5 11. Nc3 Nb4 12. Qd2 Nd7 13. a3 Nc6 14. Nd5 Qd8 15. Qc3 f5

and obviously has a lot of faith in its soundness.} 6. e3 (6. g3 Nf6 7. Bg2 O-O

understand why this kind of position would suit Anands active style.}) 9... h6

from the dead just to get a chance to play this position from the black side.})
8. Qc2 {A sensible way to avoid the doubled pawn on c3.} Ngf6 9. a3 Bxc3+ 10.
Qxc3 O-O 11. Be2 Re8 12. b4 {This pawn move always make me cringe on the
inside. I'm not saying that it is bad, but when Black starts shuffling his
pieces around on the light squares it might be nice to still have this pawn on
b3. I guess there are a few GM:s who feel with me, but the majority seem to
value space more than any vague notions about light squares.} e4 $1 {This is
one of those moves that you shouldn't hesitate to make. It is clearly the best
Black can hope for with this pawn structure.} 13. Nd2 d5 $1 {This is where I
first logged in to watch the games and I felt something had gone wrong for
Caruana. (...and I also felt that the b4 pawn might have been happier on b3,
so that White could play Ba3 and perhaps Qc3-b4-d6.)} 14. a4 ({The engines
love - if that is the right word - to play} 14. c5 $5 {, but although White
gets a free hand on the queenside, the same is basically true for Black on the
kingside. Also, should White choose to play 0-0-0, it is still possible to
apply the can opener with b6 and a5.} Nf8 15. h3 {[%cal Rc8g4]} Ng6 16. a4 Bd7

Nxf3 exf3 20. Bxf3 cxb5 {and Bc1 is a hundred miles awar from a life.}) 18...
h6 {and with Nf6-h7-g5 coming next, White must start wondering whether it will
be enough to get a rook down to b7? (The answer is: probably not.)}) 14... dxc4
$1 {If White had more pressure on e4, this would not be recommendable, but in
this situation Black is better developed, has a wonderful square for a knight
on d5 and does not have to worry about e4.} 15. Nxc4 Nb6 $1 16. Na5 (16. Ne5
Nfd5 $1) (16. O-O Bg4 $1 17. Bxg4 Nxg4 18. h3 Nf6 19. Bd2 {and the engine
wants me to believe that the position is almost equal. Well... after} Nfd5 20.
Qb3 Nxc4 21. Qxc4 Re6 22. b5 Qd7 23. Qb3 a6 $1 24. bxc6 Rxc6 25. Rfc1 Rac8 {
I would under no circumstances want to play the White side.}) 16... Nbd5 (16...
Nfd5 17. Qd2 Qg5 {looks very promising too.}) 17. Qd2 Qc7 18. h3 Re6 $5 {
A lovely move that has more than one function. ON one hand it is ready to
attack the kingside at any moment, but also it might come in handy if White
continues with b4-b5.} 19. Ba3 (19. Nc4 Ne8 20. b5 cxb5 (20... a6 21. bxa6 b5
$5) 21. axb5 Nd6 22. Nxd6 Rxd6 23. Bb2 Rg6 24. Rc1 Qd6 25. Kf1 Be6 26. Rc5 Qd7)
({White's natural plan is to play b4-b5, but when Black's pieces are so well
organized and active, it tends to backfire:} 19. b5 $6 cxb5 20. axb5 Bd7 $1 21.
Ba3 b6 22. Rc1 Qb8 23. Nc6 Qe8 {and pawns will fall.}) 19... a6 20. Nb3 $6 {
This knight is feeling a bit lost. It was well placed on a5, but there was no
way forward. Now it seeks greener pastures, but it turns out to be no better
than the last one. In the mean time Anand improves his forces coordination
further.} Ne8 $3 {Another great move. From d6 the knight keeps and eye on e4,
c4 and f5, while it makes b4-b5 harder to play for White. It also opens the
road to g6 for the rook. You cannot ask for more of one move.} 21. Nc5 Rg6 22.
g3 ({It's horrible to leave the f-pawn behind in this way, but} 22. Kf1 Nd6 {
was not an option.}) 22... Nd6 23. a5 {This move looks like a sign of
desperation. Not only does White give up all future counterplay on the
queenside, but also the bishop on a3 gets completely entombed. I would
normally give such a move a "?!", but I trust that Caruana had better reasons
that my engine and I can whip up in five minutes.} Bf5 $1 24. Qc2 Re8 25. O-O-O
Qc8 (25... Ra8 $5 {[%cal Gb7b6]}) 26. g4 Bd7 27. Kb1 f5 $5 ({There is some
kind of mute, unformulated guideline, that tells me to attack the g4-pawn with
} 27... h5 {rather than move the f-pawn. Perhaps it is because I prefer to
keep my pawns in one long chain. However, in this position, Anands choice
makes even more sense as it opens the f-file towards f2.} 28. Rh2 hxg4 29. hxg4
Bxg4 30. Rdh1 f5 $17) 28. gxf5 Rf6 29. Rdg1 Bxf5 30. h4 Ref8 31. Rh2 Kh8 {
It seems that Anand is keeping the tempo up as Caruana feels the pressure from
the clock.} ({Here I see no defence against} 31... Qc7 32. Rhg2 Bc8 $1 {
and the f2-pawn falls:} 33. Bc1 (33. Bd1 Nb5 $19) (33. Bf1 Qf7) (33. Rxg7+ Qxg7
34. Rxg7+ Kxg7 {is utterly hopeless for White who has only one active piece.})
33... Rxf2) 32. Qd2 Rg6 33. Rxg6 hxg6 $5 {This makes things a bit harder, but
in time pressure it is almost impossible for White to find the defence.} (33...
Bxg6) 34. h5 $1 g5 35. h6 g6 36. Bb2 $6 {After this move White is irreversibly
lost. The only chance was to try to exchange Be2 for another piece than
Black's bishop:} (36. Bd1 $1 Bg4 37. Bb3 Bf3 $1 38. Qc1 {and White can try
something with Bxd5 and then queen to g3. Still, Black should win with g4 and
then Rf8-f5-h5.}) 36... Bg4 $1 37. Bf1 Kh7 38. Ka1 Bf3 {To quote Italo Svevo,
White's position has become the "tomb of its (sic) good intentions". The rest
is just a demonstration of how helpless White is.} 39. Rh3 g4 40. Rg3 Rf5 41.
Na4 Qf8 42. Nb6 Qxh6 43. Nxd5 cxd5 44. Qc1 Qh1 45. Qc7+ {This loses fast, but
everything else loses almost as fast.} Rf7 46. Qxd6 Qxf1+ 47. Ka2 Be2 {White
has no way to deal with Bc4+, followed by Qd3, so he resigned.} 0-1
