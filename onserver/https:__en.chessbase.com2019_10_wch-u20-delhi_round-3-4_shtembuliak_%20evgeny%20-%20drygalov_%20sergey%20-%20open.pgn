1. c4 e5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. e4 Bxc3 6. dxc3 O-O 7. Qc2 $5 {
Shtembuliak wants to develop his knight on f3 because it is well placed on
this square and can go to f3-d2. This knight can then be manoevured in a nice
way to move to d5 via f1-e3. That's the reason why the e4 pawn has to be
protected. Also possible was to play Qe2.} d6 8. Nf3 h6 9. O-O Be6 10. b3 a6
11. a4 Na5 12. Rb1 Qe8 13. Nh4 {Shtembuliak changes his plans and now aims to
play more aggressively with f4.} (13. Re1 $5 {was more prophylactic because
after} b5 14. cxb5 axb5 15. b4 Nc4 16. a5 {Now the move d5 is not possible.})
13... b5 $5 14. cxb5 axb5 15. b4 Nc4 16. a5 {The position is interesting here.
True the pawn on a5 is strong, but overall Black has a nice position because
his pieces are well placed.} d5 $1 17. exd5 Bxd5 {If the bishops are exchanged,
the black knights will dominate on the light squares. Hence, White played the
next move.} 18. f3 c5 19. Nf5 cxb4 20. cxb4 Rc8 21. Qf2 Be6 22. Ne3 $1 {
Mission accomplished the knight on c4 is going to be removed.} Nd5 23. f4 e4 (

25. Bxe3 Bxf5 26. Bc5 $1 Bg6 27. Rbe1 $1 {Here we can see Shtembuliak's
excellent feel for chess. He could have simply grabbed the rook on f8 but sees
that there are issues related to the move ...e3. So he calmly moved his rook
to e1. The rook on f8 is not running away.} (27. Bxf8 e3 $5) 27... e3 28. Bxe3
$1 (28. Qe2 Rxc5 $14) 28... Nxe3 29. Qxe3 {Yes the material is even in the
position. But the bishop on g2 combined with the a5 pawn give White a clear
advantage.} Qd7 30. a6 Rfe8 31. Qb6 (31. Qf2 Rc2 32. Rxe8+ Qxe8 33. Re1 Qd8 34.
Qe3 Rxg2+ 35. Kxg2 Qa8+ 36. Qf3 Qxa6 {This still has good chances in the
position for White, but you do not want to lose your a-pawn.}) 31... Rxe1 32.
Rxe1 Qd2 33. Qe3 Qxe3+ $6 (33... Qxb4 $1 {would have given Black some
interesting fighting chances.} 34. a7 Qa5 35. Qe8+ (35. h3 $1 {is better for
White. But why not the natural Qe8+}) 35... Kh7 36. a8=Q Rxa8 37. Bxa8 {
It seems like White is winning, after all he is a rook up. But next comes the
move ...f6!} f6 $1 $11 {What a beautiful position. The queen on e8 is
overloaded because it cannot control both the rook on e1 and the bishop on a8.}
