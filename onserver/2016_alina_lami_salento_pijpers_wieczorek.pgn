1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bg5 Qb6 $6 {This is an
inaccurate move order.} ({A better way to reach the position Oskar had in mind
is} 6... e6 7. Qd2 Qb6 8. Bxf6 (8. O-O-O $5 {is an alternative known from the
game Kasparov-Mchedlishvili}) 8... gxf6 9. Nb3 {.}) 7. Nb3 e6 8. Bf4 $1 Ne5 9.
Be3 Qc7 10. f4 Nc6 {In this position, and not counting the usual Qb6-c7 to
kick the knight back to b3, both sides have lost two tempi: Bc1-g5-f4-e3 and
Nc6-e5-c6. But from a normal move order White will never be able to get this
position, because 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Qb6 5. Nb3 Nf6 6. Nc3
e6 7. Be3 Qc7 8. f4 is met not by 8...d6 (leading to this exact position) but
by 8...Bb4!.} ({The knight is forced to go back because} 10... Nc4 $2 {fails to
} 11. Nb5 Qc6 12. Bxc4 Qxc4 13. Qd3 {with a big advantage for white.}) 11. g4 {
The kingside assault starts. I think White is clearly better, but of course in
these Sicilians anything can still happen.} a6 12. g5 Nd7 13. Qf3 b5 14. O-O-O
(14. a3 {was a possible alternative to stop ...b4.}) 14... b4 {Now I have to
make a difficult choice. The simple Ne2 is perfectly fine of course, but I
decided to play the more ambitious Na4. The knight is more useful there, but
it is also almost trapped.} 15. Na4 $5 Bb7 16. Kb1 $6 {A lazy move.} ({
Stronger was} 16. Qf2 $1 {, immediately attacking the b6-square.}) 16... Ne7 {
Making way for the bishop to go to c6 and trap my knight.} 17. Nd4 ({Another
very interesting option that we both saw during the game was} 17. Rd4 $5 {
, e.g.} d5 18. Rxb4 dxe4 19. Qf2 Bd5 {with a very unclear position.}) 17... Qa5
$6 {A very logical way to play, and it is hard to blame Oskar for missing my
idea.} ({Best was probably} 17... Nf5 {.}) ({After the immediate} 17... Nc5 $2
{I had planned a nice trick:} 18. Nxc5 dxc5 19. Bb5+ $1) 18. b3 Nc5 19. Nxc5
dxc5 {Now if I have to retreat to e2 the position should be alright for Black.
But that was definitely not my intention!} 20. Nxe6 $3 {When your opponent
neglects his development you should always be looking for opportunities to
blast open the centre!} fxe6 21. Bc4 Qb6 {Almost forced, because otherwise I
will pick up e6 with two pawns and an ongoing attack for the piece. Now I must
decide between Qg4 and Qh3. It turns out both moves are good.} 22. Qh3 ({
I rejected} 22. Qg4 {because of} Bc8 {, but even here I can get a big
advantage with the really neat} ({if Black continues as in the game the queen
will be better placed on g4 than h3:} 22... Bxe4 23. Bxe6 Bxh1 24. Bd7+ Kf7 25.
Bxc5 Qg6 26. f5 {and White wins immediately because g5 is protected}) 23. f5
exf5 24. Qg3 $1) 22... Bxe4 $5 {A very brave decision. But the alternatives
were clearly bad for Black and Oskar couldn't see a refutation of this pawn
grab, so he went for it. Of course the computer engines will easily find a win
for White, but in the game I did not manage to do so.} ({The idea behind Qh3
was to meet} 22... Bc8 {with} 23. g6 $1 Nxg6 24. Qh5 {, winning.}) 23. Bxe6
Bxh1 24. Bd7+ ({The main alternative was} 24. Bxc5 {, but after} Qxc5 25. Bd7+
Kd8 26. Bc6+ Kc7 27. Qd7+ Kb6 {there is no mate, e.g.} 28. Qb7+ Ka5 29. Qc7+
Qb6 30. Qe5+ Nd5 31. Bxd5 Bd6) 24... Kf7 ({Now the king has to move the other
way, because} 24... Kd8 {loses to} 25. Bc6+ Kc7 26. Qd7+ Kb8 27. f5 {.}) 25.
Bxc5 $6 ({Very strong would have been} 25. Rxh1 $1 {and there is no reasonable
way to stop Bxc5.}) 25... Qg6 26. f5 Qxg5 27. Be6+ Ke8 28. Bd7+ Kf7 29. Be6+ (
29. Rxh1 $5 {is still a better try for an advantage, but it is already far
less clear than four moves ago.}) 29... Ke8 30. Qd3 {Threatening mate. Black
has three ways to prevent it, and only one of them saves the game.} Bc6 $2 ({
The correct way to defend was} 30... Nd5 $1 {. During the game I saw that I
had at least a perpetual after} 31. Bxd5 Bxc5 32. Bxa8 Bxa8 33. Qd7+ Kf8 34.
Qc8+ Kf7 35. Qe6+ Kf8 {and it turns out I have no more than that.}) (30... Bd5
$2 31. Bxd5 Rd8 {leaves White with several ways to win, for example} 32. Qe2 {.
}) 31. Bb6 $1 {Now the position is completely winning for White. But the
insane complications throughout the whole game cost both of us a lot of
thinking time and here we were almost down to increment, which caused many
mistakes in the final part of the game.} Nxf5 32. Bd7+ $6 (32. Qc4 $1 {would
have been immediately decisive.}) 32... Kf7 33. Bxc6 $6 ({Here I realised that
} 33. Qc4+ $1 {no longer leads to mate on e6 because the f5-pawn is gone, but
it shouldn't have been too difficult to see} Kg6 34. Qxc6+ {, just picking up
material and winning.}) 33... Rb8 $6 34. Qd5+ Kf6 35. Ba7 $6 (35. Re1 $1) 35...
Bd6 $6 (35... Qf4 $1) 36. Bxb8 $4 {With just seconds left I panic and decide
to take material.} ({The position was still winning, for example with} 36. Bd4+
Ke7 37. Re1+ Kd8 38. Qf7 Be7 39. Qe6) 36... Bxb8 {And with the bishop pair
gone I no longer have enough pieces for a successful attack.} 37. Re1 g6 38.
Qd7 Qf4 39. Qe6+ Kg7 40. Be8 Rf8 {The time control has been made and I'm just
a piece down, so I resigned. A crazy game!} 0-1
