{This game was not like what I expected it to be. The fact that Leko lost and
Cori won yesterday made me think this would be a drab draw. What instead
happened is a masterclass on the White side of the French!} 1. e4 {Good to see
Leko returning to his favourite opening move. I think this decision has a lot
to do with knowing that Cori plays either the French or the Sicilian, and the
fact that he beat Maghsoodloo with the French Defense probably hinted that the
opening was not a one-off.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {This move along with 3.Nd2 is
considered the most testing line for Black players.} Nf6 {This is one of the
theoretical main lines, but as a French player myself I have never had a good
opinion of giving White a free attack on the kingside with queenside
counterplay being a little harder to procure.} (3... Bb4 {is more in the
spirit of a dynamic French defender, but Cori's choice is mostly due to his
stylistic preference.}) 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Be7 {This move
has scored the best, and has been tried by numerous top grandmasters in recent
times.} (7... a6 {has been the most played move, and remains playable. For
example} 8. Qd2 b5 9. a3 Bb7 10. Bd3 Qc7 $13 {Svidler,P (2728)-Morozevich,A 
(2741) Monte Carlo 2007.}) (7... cxd4 {is another serious option, taking play
into a Sicilian like structure. Play can now go} 8. Nxd4 Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10.
O-O-O a6 11. Qf2 Bxd4 12. Bxd4 b5 13. Be3 Qa5 {with a complex middlegame,
where I prefer White's kingside attacking chances, So,W (2808)-Holt,C (2567)
chess.com INT 2017}) 8. Qd2 O-O 9. dxc5 Nxc5 10. O-O-O a6 11. h4 {Leko chooses
to go down a rarer continuation. This line has scored brilliantly in the
database, probably because White gets in his attack first.} b5 12. Bd3 (12. Qf2
$1 {looks far more critical to me, and is the engine's top choice as well.
White seeks to gain a tempo on the knight to swing over to the kingside, where
his queen is well placed to assist in the attack. Black's best try appears to
be} Na4 $1 {a computer suggestion and not entirely stupid.} (12... Nd7 $5 {
is another 'human' possiblity. However, retreating when faced with an attack
doesn't seem correct to me. White now continues} 13. Bd3 $1 f6 $2 {This
natural move is a mistake, but it is important to know why.} (13... b4 $5 {
is safer, but Black is still in trouble after} 14. Na4 Bb7 (14... f6 15. Ng5 $1

base of Black's pawns on e6, and the vulnerable h7 point at the same time. If
Black takes the knight with} fxg5 15. hxg5 h6 16. gxh6 g5 17. Qg3 $18 {he is
getting smashed on the kingside.}) 13. Nxa4 bxa4 14. c3 a3 15. b3 Bd7 16. Bd3
$14 {with a slightly better position for White - his pieces make a lot more
sense and the attack is soon coming with ideas of g4, h5, f5. For a human it
seems easier to play with White.}) 12... Nxd3+ 13. Qxd3 Nb4 14. Qd2 Bb7 15. Kb1
$146 {A logical novelty from Leko, adding stability to his pawn cover.} Rc8 16.
f5 $1 {Somehow Cori's opening play doesn't seem convincing to me. White uses
the opportunity to break down Black's central structure. It would be too harsh
to call the opening variation wrong, but something seems incorrect with
Black's play - White is getting in breaks too easily.} exf5 17. a3 d4 18. Nxd4
Nd5 19. Nxd5 Bxd5 20. Nxb5 Be4 21. Nc3 Qc7 {This is supposedly the first
mistake from Black, but I feel that this is a result of his offbeat early
middlegame play.} (21... Bc6 {is what the engines want to play, but I managed
to find a strong idea here -} 22. Bg5 $1 Qxd2 {is the best move here - Black
needs to escape to the endgame.} (22... Qc7 23. Bxe7 Qxe7 24. Nd5 Qxe5 (24...

enduring initiative even in the endgame. The cute point here is that pawn
grabbing doesn't work -} Rfd8 28. Qe2 Rxd1+ 29. Rxd1 gxh5 $2 30. e6 $1 $18 {

Rxf5 Rxh4 29. Re2 $16 {and I don't see a precise way for Black to fully
equalise. These sort of endgames are very unpleasant for him - g2 can easily
be defended, while the a6 pawn looks really weak. The white king is closer to
the main battlefield and White's pawns are ready to roll.}) 23. Rxd2 Bxg5 24.

22. Nxe4 fxe4 23. Bd4 Rb8 24. Rh3 {White has consolidated the extra pawn quite
efficiently. Special mention must be made of the bishop on d4, which holds the
queenside together, and the rook on h3, which is ready to swing over when
necessary. More spare is more often than not an advantage.} Rfd8 25. Qe2 Qc6
26. Rc3 $2 {This natural move move surprisingly loses all of White's advantage.

sufficiently defended, so it makes sense to start aggressive operations.

nowhere near threatening.}) 27. Qxe4 Bxa3 28. Rhd3 Rdc8 29. b3 Qc4 30. Rc3 Qe6

queens, and after} 27. Qxb5 Rxb5 {we notice that the e5 pawn can't be saved.}

This is a lot of flash from Leko. The comps initially don't understand his
idea, which makes the sacrifice all the more beautiful!} (37. Re1 {wins simply.
