{The game was very interesting up to this point, as it is quite difficult to
master these type of unbalanced positions, in this case: two rooks + bishop vs
queen and a bunch of rolling pawns... But the question is: how to continue
with Black?} 51... h2 $1 52. Rxf3 exf3 53. Rh5 f2 {I liked this sequence of
pawn moves, when the little soldiers show their strength, metamorphosing into
valuable queens.} 54. Rxh2 f1=Q {Black is better but didn't succeed to break
White's defence.} 55. Rh7 Qg2+ 56. Bd2 Qe4+ 57. Kc3 Ke6 58. Rxb7 c5 59. d5+

Qd1 79. Ra2 Qb3+ {I believe the 30 moves draw rule or Sofia rules or any kind
of against-draw-rule is unnecessary in this event: all the games were hard
fought, on the top boards and beyond that.} 1/2-1/2
