Anish Giri in round three. Topalov came to the board with a new idea which he
now showcases.} 11. Rb1 $5 $146 {[%cal Ga1b1] [#] As Topalov explained after
the game, this move is connected with the idea of getting in b4 to stop c5.
White always wants to make this move in the opening in this line but is never
able to. This is a very brute way to force it.} c5 {Topalov condemned this move
after the game, but in a way it looks perfectly natural because it nips the b4
idea in the bud.} (11... Nbd7 {is another option as after} 12. b4 Bb7 ( 12...

rook on b2 instead of b1 makes such a huge difference. And Karjakin was
extremely alert.} Bd6 $5 {[%cal Ge7f8,Ge7d6] [#]} 16. Nd3 (16. Nxd5 { was still
