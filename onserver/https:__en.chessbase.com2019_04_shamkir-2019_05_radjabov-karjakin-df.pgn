An extremely rare choice compared to 7...a6, and even compared to 7...b5.
However, there seems to have been some elite interest in it, including- a game
between Karjakin and another Azeri top player from the previous year.} 8. Qxc4

hard to see what Black could have done better.}) 8... b5 9. Qc2 Bb7 10. Bg5 {
Playing by analogy to the 7...a6 system: surely it cannot be to Black's
advantage needing to play ...c5 in two moves?} ({Mamedyarov also adopted 7...
c6 himself in Berlin, in a twist to an opening discussion which I confess had
flown very much under the radar for me, especially compared to the
Semi-Tarrasches from that event:} 10. Nc3 Nbd7 11. Rd1 Qb6 12. Ne5 Rfd8 13. Be3

only a few possible ways to stop this.} 11. Ne5 (11. Rc1 $6 {is the kind of
thing Catalan players derive perverse satisfaction from coming up with, but it
doesn't actually prevent ...c5 because of the tactic} c5 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. dxc5

are likely to be traded soon and then things will quieten down.}) 14. axb5 axb5
15. dxc5 Rc8 16. Nb3 $14 {It will take Black some time to recover the c5-pawn,
and when he does White will have his other knight on d3 ready to claim
superior co-ordination.}) 11... Nxe5 12. dxe5 Nd7 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 14. f4 {
It looks like White has achieved something, but in fact ...e5 releases just as
much potential energy as the more usual break ...c5.} f6 $1 {Equalising.} 15.
exf6 Nxf6 16. Nd2 e5 {On a human level, this simply has to be done, and the
sooner the better- but it's also interesting to keep ...c5 on the table by
beginning with ...Rac8!?} 17. e3 ({The engine recommends some 'big-picture
chess' beginning with} 17. Ne4 $5 Nxe4 (17... exf4 $6 18. Rxf4 Nd5 19. Rxf8+

time.} (25... Kh8 $11 {was a lot more natural.}) 26. Qxa4 c5 27. Rb1 $5 {
There are other moves of equal value, but this is reasonably straightforward.}

tactical problems, which is the undefended nature of the Bb7.} (27... Kh8 $6

something like} 28. Ra1 Kh8 29. Rfb1 Qc7 30. Qxa7 Qxa7 31. Rxa7 Ne3 32. Bxa8

a draw, but Black has some work still to do.}) 30... Nxg2 31. Rxa6 Rd2 32. Nc4

passivity of Black's position, the reduced material means that White has no
