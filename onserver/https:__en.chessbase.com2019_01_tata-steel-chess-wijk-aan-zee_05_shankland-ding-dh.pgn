1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. h3
Bb7 9. d3 d6 10. c3 {This plan is rarely seen at the top level nowadays.} ({
White's set-up is usually associated with keeping the bishop on the a2-g8
diagonal. Therefore} 10. a3 {[%cal Gb3a2] is more frequently chosen.}) 10...
Na5 11. Bc2 c5 12. Nbd2 Re8 13. Nf1 h6 14. Ne3 {Another slightly unorthodox
decision from Shankland.} (14. Ng3 {is almost exclusively played by
Grandmasters in this position. Although White is unlikely to push d3-d4 in the
near future, having already moved the d-pawn, the knight simply feels more
flexible on g3. It also allows the c1-bishop to breathe more freely.}) 14...
Bf8 15. b4 $6 {A flawed plan. Shankland was already beginning to spend
considerable time on his moves; this is rarely a good idea against a player
with such vast experience of these middlegames as Ding.} (15. Nh2 {would at
least be consistent with White's previous moves, aiming for a kingside attack
or at least some control over the light-squares. Now:} d5 $1 16. Nhg4 (16. Qf3
{has also been seen in practice.}) 16... dxe4 (16... d4 17. Nf5 {leads to
tense play on the kingside.}) 17. dxe4 (17. Nxf6+ Qxf6 18. dxe4 Rad8 19. Qe2
$11 {was seen in McShane-Hebden, Hull 2018.}) 17... Nxg4 18. Qxg4 Re6 $132 {
and the game goes on.}) 15... cxb4 16. cxb4 Nc6 17. a3 d5 $1 {Ding is the
first to strike in the centre, and now only Black can hope to claim an edge.}
18. Ng4 $2 {Shankland seemingly cannot decide on a plan. This would have made
more sense a few moves ago.} ({It was time to accept that the opening had not
gone according to plan, and to simplify:} 18. Nxd5 Nxd5 19. exd5 Qxd5 20. Bb3
Qd7 21. Bb2 $11 {[%csl Gb2,Gb3] White's isolated d-pawn is balanced out by his
strong bishops on b2 and b3.}) 18... Nxg4 19. hxg4 dxe4 20. dxe4 Qxd1 21. Rxd1
a5 $1 {With simple play, Ding creates a weakness to attack on the queenside.
This is enough to cause headaches for White.} 22. bxa5 $6 {Too compliant.} (22.
Rd7 $5 {would have been an attempt to confuse matters:} Bc8 23. Rc7 $132) 22...
Nxa5 23. Rb1 Bc6 24. Nd2 Red8 25. Kf1 Nb7 26. Rb3 Bd7 (26... Rac8 $1 {would
have been a slightly more accurate move order, avoiding White's option on the
next turn.}) 27. f3 $6 (27. Nf3 {was White's final attempt to untangle. Black
still holds a big advantage, but it is not easy to convert:} Rac8 (27... Bxg4
$2 28. Rxd8 Rxd8 29. Nxe5 $11 {[%cal Gb3b5]}) 28. Ne1 b4 29. Rb1 $1 Bb5+ 30.
Kg1 Rxd1 31. Bxd1 {and White is still clinging on.}) 27... Rac8 28. Bb1 {
White's pieces are a mess. Black now profits from their lack of co-ordination:}
b4 $1 {[%cal Gd7a4]} 29. Rb2 {What else?} (29. axb4 Ba4 $19) 29... Ba4 30. Re1
Rc7 $1 $19 {A classic example of Ding's calmness. He simply improves a piece
while protecting the b7-knight and threatening to double his rooks.} 31. Ba2 (
31. axb4 Rdc8 {[%csl Gc1] traps the c1-bishop.}) 31... bxa3 32. Rb6 Bc5 33. Rb1
Bc2 $1 {Nice geometry. Black threatens both ...Bxb1 and ...Bd3+. A smooth game
from Ding, but he was given a helping hand from his opponent.} 0-1
