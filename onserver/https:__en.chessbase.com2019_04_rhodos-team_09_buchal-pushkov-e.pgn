{At this point of the match against tournament favourite Russia the Russians
were leading 2-1. Stephan Buchal, who was captain of his team, had already
missed two opportunities to get a clear advantage and now had to try to win an
ending that is objectivlely rather equal. Of course, the white knight is more
mobile and can target the pawns on f5 and h5 but Black has a lot of defensive
ressources.} 50... Bxd5 51. Kc5 Bf7 52. Nd3 Ke6 53. Kd4 Kf6 54. Nf4 Kg5 55. Ke5
