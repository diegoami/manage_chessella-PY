{A thrilling encounter between once of the leaders and the runner-up, with
Caruana clearly being the favorite going into this game. Up until this point
the second ranked player in the world won all of this games as white and was
surely looking forward to keep that victorious streak going. Let's see how the
game fared!} 1. e4 e6 {The French makes another appearance in the elite games,

black is supposed to be fine, but the theoretical knowledge required to play it

decision based on the time situation and the familiarity with the position that
his opponent was showing, an interesting try to keep more pieces on the board

fatal} (22. Nd1 Qxc2 (22... Bh6 23. Qb8+ Qc8 24. Qb6 Qc6 25. Qb8+ Qc8 26. Qa7)
