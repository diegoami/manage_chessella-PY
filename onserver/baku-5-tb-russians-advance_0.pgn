1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Qb3 dxc4 6. Qxc4 O-O 7. e4 Be6 8.
Qd3 c5 9. d5 Bg4 10. Ng5 h6 11. h3 Bc8 12. Nf3 e6 13. dxe6 Bxe6 14. Be3 Qe7 15.
Rd1 Nc6 16. Qd6 Qxd6 17. Rxd6 {A typical Grunfeld position. Black has some
problems with his c5 pawn at the moment, but he is definitely better developed
than White.} c4 (17... Na5 18. Bxc5 Rfc8 19. Be3 Rxc3 $1 {With strong
counterplay.}) 18. Rxe6 {An obvious exchange sacrifice. White does get enough
compensation for the lost material, but it is unlikely that it is any more than
that.} fxe6 19. Bxc4 Rfe8 (19... Kf7 $1) 20. Nb5 Na5 21. Bd3 {Black has some
issues since a7 is hanging and there is a fork that is being threatened on c7.}
Rec8 22. Ke2 Nc4 $5 {The start of an unusual series of trades.} (22... a6 23.
Nd6 Rd8 24. e5 Nd7 25. Bxg6 $14) 23. Nxa7 $1 Nxe3 24. Nxc8 Nxg2 25. Ne7+ $1
(25. Rc1 Nf4+ 26. Ke3 Nxh3 $15) 25... Kf7 26. Nxg6 $1 {A nice detail. Because
the knight covers f4, it cannot be ignored.} Kxg6 27. Rg1 Rxa2 (27... Nd7 28.
Rxg2+ Kf7 {was probably better, gunning for the b2 pawn and taking control of
e5.}) 28. Rxg2+ Kf7 29. Ne5+ {White emergest upa a pawn and retains winning
chances.} Kf8 30. Ng6+ Kf7 31. Nf4 Rxb2+ 32. Ke3 Bf8 33. Bc4 Rb6 { Black is
just in time to defend his pawn, but even that endgame is unpleasant.} 34. Nxe6
Rxe6 35. e5 (35. f4 Ke7 36. Bxe6 Kxe6 37. Kd4 Nd7 $1 {seems close to a draw as
well.}) 35... Nd7 36. f4 b5 $1 37. Bxe6+ Kxe6 38. Rd2 b4 $1 39. f5+ Kxf5 40.
Rxd7 Kxe5 {White has an extra exchange, but because of the powerful passed
b-pawn and the reduced number of pawns there is nothing Svidler can do to win.}
41. Kd3 Kf6 42. Rd5 Ke6 43. Rb5 Kf6 44. Ke4 Be7 45. Kf4 Bd6+ 46. Ke4 Be7 47.
Kf4 Bd6+ 48. Kg4 Ke6 49. Kh5 Kd7 {White captures the pawn on h6, but now the
b-pawn is dangerous.} 50. Kxh6 Kc6 51. Rf5 b3 52. Rf1 Kc5 53. h4 b2 54. Rb1 Be5
55. Kg6 Kc4 56. Rxb2 1/2-1/2
