1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. Nc3 {Perhaps a predictable opening, given
some of Adams' games from about a decade ago...} g6 {Almost entirely a modern
construction.} (4... Qc7 5. d3 a6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. a4 a5 8. Be3 e5 9. h3 Bd6 10.
Nd2 Be6 11. b3 Nd7 12. O-O f6 13. Nc4 Bxc4 14. bxc4 g6 15. Qg4 $14 {Adams,M-Ni,
H Liverpool 2007}) (4... Nd4 {was a big move before, but White is basically
just better after} 5. e5 Nxb5 6. Nxb5 Nd5 7. Ng5 a6 8. Qf3 f6 9. Qxd5 fxg5 10.
Nc3 $14) 5. h3 Bg7 6. e5 Ng8 7. Bxc6 dxc6 8. d3 {Not knowing an awful lot
about the Rossolimo, it wasn't clear to me what Black had gained in exchange
for spending two tempi on ...Nf6-g8. However, looking at it a bit, it seems to
me that Black is okay after the text.} Nh6 (8... h5 9. Ne4 $14) (8... b6 9. Qe2
h5 10. Bg5 $14) 9. g4 $5 {An ambitious move, but this isn't a position that
rewards half-baked play.} (9. Qe2 Nf5 $132 {or something will just be fine for
Black as in the Berlin.}) 9... O-O 10. Qe2 (10. Be3 f5 11. exf6 exf6 12. Qd2
Nf7 13. O-O-O Qa5 $11 {Harikrishna,P-Alsina Leal,D Leon 2012}) 10... Qb6 $6 {
Presumably Nick regretted this move.} (10... f5 11. g5 Nf7 12. Bf4 Qa5 $13 {
The position is extremely concrete, and bears a strange resemblance to the
McCutcheon variation in the French. I suspect Black is okay here, but will
leave the definitive assessment to the cloud engines. One of Black's cooler
ideas is ...Nd8-e6-d4.}) (10... f6 $6 {is the more controlled version, but it
suffers from a crucial defect in that Black may not actually want to take on
e5 if given the chance.} 11. Be3 Nf7 $1 (11... fxe5 12. Nd2 $16 (12. Bxc5 Nxg4
$3 $17)) 12. Bxc5 $14) 11. Nd2 Qc7 12. Nb3 $1 (12. f4 f6 {must be okay for
Black, who is now fine to take on e5 with a pawn, even if my machine does have
a bizarre fixation with} 13. Rg1 $5 fxe5 14. f5 $40) 12... f5 {Understandable,
but this makes things worse.} (12... f6 13. Nxc5 Nf7 $14) 13. g5 Nf7 14. f4 $1
b6 15. Be3 Be6 16. Nd2 Bd5 17. Nf3 $14 {White has completed his clamp.} Nd8 18.
h4 Ne6 19. h5 Bxf3 20. Qxf3 Nd4 21. Qf2 Rfd8 22. O-O-O e6 23. Rh4 Qd7 (23... a5
$5 {was a move I wanted, looking at the demonstration board, but it is
actually plausible that Black didn't like} 24. Na4 $5 {which jams his
queenside pawns together in a slightly awkward way.}) 24. Ne2 Nxe2+ 25. Qxe2
Kf7 26. c4 {A double-edged decision, and probably the right one. White sets in
motion a plan to eventually break with b4, and open a second front.} (26. Rdh1
Qd5 27. Kb1 a5 {As in the Stonewall Dutch, Black has an awful bishop and some
disgusting structural issues, but there is nothing that badly wrong with his
position in reality, because White can't break through on the side where he is
that much stronger.}) 26... Qc7 27. Rdh1 Rg8 28. R1h3 Rad8 29. Kc2 Qc8 30. Qf3
a5 31. Rh2 Qd7 32. Rd2 Qc7 33. Qh1 Qc8 (33... a4 {immediately might improve,
getting ...b5 in a little bit faster to try and get moving.}) 34. Rh3 Qd7 35.
Qf3 Qc8 36. Rh1 Rd7 37. Kd1 Rgd8 38. Ke2 a4 39. Rb1 Ra7 40. b4 $1 {In my mind
there is little question that this move brings the position from +/= to +/-.
However, it also very suddenly sharpens matters, leaving both sides chances to
go badly wrong.} axb3 41. Rxb3 Qc7 42. Rdb2 $6 {Now Black can counter-attack a
bit.} (42. Qh1 $1 $16 {The queen belongs on b1, where it attacks b6 and a2.
Nick might still be defending this now if White had played this way.}) 42...
Rda8 (42... Bf8 $5) 43. Rxb6 (43. a4 $1 $16 {is a computer move to keep the
advantage.}) 43... Rxa2 $1 {Now Black is fully in the game, and in many lines
he is sacrificing on e5. White wasn't able to find the silicon-esque 44.Kf1!?
+/= and simply played a move that allowed the draw.} 44. R6b3 $6 Bxe5 $1 45.
fxe5 (45. fxe5 Qxe5 46. Rxa2 Rxa2+ 47. Ke1 $11 {and Black has no better than
perpetual.}) 1/2-1/2
