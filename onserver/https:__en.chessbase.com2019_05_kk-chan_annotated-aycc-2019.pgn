against white's queenside. After round eight, he was the leading Sri Lankan player
in this Under-16 contest ahead of CM Liyanage Ranindu, who is due to play with
White against Sankalp Gupta in round nine. Perhaps, Dabarera was playing to
finish ahead of Ranindu and decided to go for broke here. Black puts early
pressure against White's centre together with the threat against the white
pawn on b2.} ({One of the earlier games in this line saw the exchange of pawns
on d5, and this move was played quite regularly by Spielmann, known to many as
"The Last Romantic" for his dashing attacks and sacrifices.} 5... exd5 6. cxd5

This is a standard way of play by White - he aims to "attack" the slightly
premature expansion of Black's pawns on the queenside and fix them on dark

a piece and puts pressure on the black b5-pawn.} bxc4 7. e4 $1 {White, already
down a pawn, sacrifices another one, emphasising correctly the need to
strengthen his centre and to open up the path for the f1-bishop to develop
itself. Other alternatives, such as Rb1 or Qd2, which are aimed to protect the
b2-pawn will result in the destruction of White's centre.} Qxb2 8. Bd2 Qb6 (

commanding lead in piece development.} Ba6 10. Rb1 Qd8 11. Rxb8 $1 {White gave
up his rook for two minor pieces and in the process "took out" one of only
two Black's active pieces. This calmed the game down and helped Moksh Amit
take control of the game. There wasn't much left for Black to do from here
onwards.} Rxb8 12. Bxa6 Qb6 13. Bc4 {White's minor pieces assumed full control
of all key squares along the b-file, rendering Black's major piece control
there useless.} g6 {Black tried to untangle his kingside.} 14. e5 $1 {Without
giving Black any breathing space, White pushed ahead to attack the centre.}

weaknesses!} exd5 16. Nxd5 Qb1 17. Nf6+ Ke7 18. O-O Qxd1 19. Rxd1 h6 {Forced.
Otherwise, White will play Bg5, threatening a discovered check on the black
e7-king as well as to capture the black pawn on d7.} 20. Bc3 Rb7 21. Nd5+ Ke8 22.
