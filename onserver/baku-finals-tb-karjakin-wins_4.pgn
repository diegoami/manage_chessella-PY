15. Rxe8+ Qxe8 16. Nd2 Qe1+ 17. Nf1 Bg6 {A known theoretical position.
Karjakin, a known theoretical monster, commits a blunder when he still has
several normal choices (h3, Bxd5 and g3 have all been played by grandmasters).
He instead blunders immediately.} 18. Bc2 $2 b4 $2 (18... Nxc3 $1 19. bxc3 {
what else? Ne2+ was coming.} Qxc3 {and the double attack on c2 and a1 gives
Black a winning position.} 20. Bg5 (20. Be3 Qxa1 21. Qxc6 Rd8 $19) 20... h6 $1

Qxb4 24. Bxb3 {Karjakin is up two pawns, though Black still has some
compensation on this one. White's pieces are very passive.} Qb6 25. Re1 Bc5 26.

Rd1 Qxb2 {Svidler manages to grab one pawn back, and suddenly his position is
not so bad.} 28. Bxc6 Bh5 {Svidler's trick isn't so good} (28... Rxd3 $1 29.
Rxd3 Bxd3 $11 {was a better way of going at it.}) 29. Rb1 $4 {The following
moves are very hard to explain, so I'm not going to try except by throwing out
words like blitz, pressure, exhaustion, etc.} (29. g4 $1 Bxg4 30. Qxg4 Qxf2+
31. Kh1 Rxd3 32. Rb1 {and Black has nothing except a piece deficit.}) 29...

two pawns that will fall very soon.}) 30. Qxh5 Bxf2+ $6 (30... Qb6 31. Bd5
Bxf2+ 32. Kh1 Qf6 {was cleaner.}) 31. Kxf2 Qb6+ 32. Ne3 Qxc6 33. Nd5 {White has
no compensation for his missing material. His king is exposed and Black can
create real threats.} Qd6 $2 (33... Qc5+ 34. Kf1 Qa3 $19) 34. g3 h6 35. Qe2 Rb8

pushing hard with Black to simply dropping his rook.} 1-0
