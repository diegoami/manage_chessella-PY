{Now we come to the most important game. The result would create the winner of
the tournament.} 1. d4 e6 {I noticed Potula was unlucky, because he got Black
twice in a row.} 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 b6 4. Bd3 Bb7 5. Nbd2 d6 6. b3 Nbd7 7. Bb2
Be7 8. c4 c5 9. Qc2 O-O 10. O-O Rc8 11. Rae1 d5 12. Qb1 {Obviously White
removes the queen from the Rc8 fire!} h6 13. Ne5 cxd4 14. exd4 dxc4 15. bxc4
Nxe5 16. Rxe5 Bd6 17. Re2 {At this point White has 3 minutes and 32 seconds,
and Black has 4 minutes and 10 seconds.} Bxh2+ $4 $18 {Black took 6 seconds to
decide on this sacrifice, also known as Greek gift. There is an entire book of
games and exercises on such sacrifice, and often it is extremely difficult to
see if it is correct in long time control games. In Blitz I guess nearly
impossible, but at this point White began to think, and likely found the move
which would refute it.} 18. Kxh2 {White took about 35 seconds to decide to
take.} Ng4+ 19. Kg3 Qg5 $6 20. f4 $1 {Here White took another 20 seconds to
verify the correctness of this move, and from this point on, he is winning.}
Qf6 {Black took over 1 minute for this move, showing he didn't see Pf2-f4
refuting the sacrifice.} 21. Kxg4 {Quite amazing to have the king so exposed,
and Black cannot win!} h5+ 22. Kh3 (22. Kxh5 Qh6+ 23. Kg4 Qh2 {Obviously to
take wasn't really good, also if White is still winning.}) 22... Rfd8 23. Be4 {
White has 1 minute and 30 seconds left, and Black 2 minutes and 28 seconds.}
Ba6 24. Qd3 Qe7 25. Rc1 Qd7 26. Kh2 f5 27. Bf3 g6 {this move creates a complex
of weak dark squares which White will use to give checkmate.} 28. Qe3 {here we
can see the beginning of transfering the pieces on the dark squares to enter
the enemy castle and kill the king!} Re8 29. Ree1 {Notice how White, before
launching the attack, cover his weaknesses.} Qe7 30. g3 (30. d5 $1 e5 31. fxe5
Rcd8 32. Qd4 {White is winning.}) 30... Qf6 (30... h4 31. d5 hxg3+ 32. Kxg3 e5
33. Bxe5 {White is winning.}) 31. Ba1 {Once more White, before attacking,
prefers protect all hanging pieces, and avoid giving Black a chance to
counter- attack.} Qd8 32. d5 exd5 33. Bxd5+ {The engine finds a checkmate in 8
moves.} ({Komodo 11 64-bit:} 33. Qd4 Re5 34. Rxe5 Qf6 35. Re8+ Rxe8 36. Qxf6 d4

move White has 35 seconds left, and Black has 1 minute.} Rcd8 ({Komodo 11

Bxf7 Rg8 40. Qg5+ Kh7 41. Re7 Rd2+ 42. Kg1 Rg2+ 43. Kf1 {White has 18 seconds
left, Black 15.} Rh2 44. Bxg6# {This move is checkmate, but Black didn't see
it, White neither. Black continued with Rg7, to which White played Rxg7, Black
played Kh8 and finally White gave checkmate for the second time with Qd8.} 1-0
