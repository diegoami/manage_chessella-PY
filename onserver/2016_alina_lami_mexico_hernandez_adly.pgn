{Shoutout to Ahmed, who took an incredible decision based on intuition, after
a long traveling torture and no rest whatsoever. I wouldn't have dared for
sure, given the circumstances, but the Egyptian likes to stir in some crazy
moves:} 13... Nxe4 $1 {Objectively speaking, there was a better alternative,} (
{the calmer} 13... Bxf3 14. gxf3 g5 $5 15. Be3 (15. Bxg5 {is not advisable due
to} Rg8) 15... Nd7 16. Nd2 Ne5 17. b3 Nd3 {with very nice control over the
black squares. Positionally, Black is enjoying a healthy life and the
advantage, where the king can happily walk around via d7 and c6, if he pleases
so. However, the game continuation made my eyes pop in astonishment for its
dynamic beauty.}) 14. Rxe4 Rd1+ 15. Kh2 Bxf3 16. gxf3 Bf6 17. Be5 {very
natural but not the most efficient way to put an end to Black's compensation.}
({After the game and with a smile on his face, Ahmed told me he calculated
that after} 17. Re2 {he will go} Ke7 18. Rc2 Rhd8 19. Bc1 $143 ({A spoiling
intermezzo: he missed} 19. Kg2 {with the idea Bc1! on the next move,
difference which will become clear later on.}) 19... Rxc1 20. Rxc1 Bxb2 21. Nc3
Rd4 22. Ne2 Rd2 $44 {(And now the f2-pawn is undefended, hence the purpose of
the earlier intermediate Kg2 move.) Needless to repeat but there is no harm in
doing so: my respect for such visualization and for the animated way to play.})

initiative is never easy but perhaps} 20. Rg1 {would have been better} Rxg1 21.

tied-up?! No wonder there is this saying of "dying in glory" rather than
agonizing for ages with no counterplay in sight.}) 20... e5 ({Even stronger was

{With all these double rounds, the accent falls on preserving the energy and
making as little errors as possible. Easier said than done...after an opening
and middlegame that didn't lack surprises for both sides, White went too far
and ended up in a lost position.} 97... Kc3 98. Rc1+ {Black suffered the whole
game but decided to return the favor and went for the wrong} Kd2 ({Winning on
the spot was} 98... Bc2 {as mentioned by the Egyptian GM right after the game.
But during the round...some weird synapses were made and he decided to win in
a 'prettier' way.}) {Black's last move was wrong but not because of:} 99. Rf1 {
