exd5 9. Bg2 O-O 10. O-O Re8 {What is wrong with Sergey, or should we ask: how
exactly does he believe so much in his system! He has played this for the
fourth time in the tournament. Nakamura tries to follow the path taken by
Veselin Topalov.} 11. Rb1 {[%cal Ga1b1]} Nbd7 {Karjakin improves on his game
against Topalov, where he went c5.} 12. b4 Bc4 13. Bf4 {This is the logical
move with the threat of Nd2.} Ne4 {Stopping Nd2.} 14. Nxe4 dxe4 15. Nd2 Bxa2
16. Bxe4 Bxb1 17. Qxb1 Nf6 $1 {Giving back the exchange. Saving the rook and
giving up the h7 pawn is just too dangerous.} 18. Bxa8 Qxa8 {The position is
relatively even at this point. The question is what exactly was Nakamura's home
preparation all about if the best he could manage was this position.} 19. e4
Rd8 $5 {This natural move was not studied by Nakamura in his home preparation.}

23. Bxe5 Rxd2 $17) (20. Be5 Ng4 $15) 20... Ng4 21. h3 $5 (21. Rc1 {is another
option at this point.} Nxe3 {Ok, Black is not really forced to take on e3, but
definitely the move Rc1 looks useful. Nakamura wanted to open the f-file
immediately for his rook.} 22. fxe3 $14) 21... Nxe3 22. fxe3 a5 $1 { I like
this move â€“ it immediately clarifies the situation on the queenside.} 23. bxa5

at all an easy move to make, but it does equalize the game.} 40. h5 Qe4+ 41.
Kh2 Qg4 $11) 39... h6 40. Qd7 Qe4+ 41. Kh2 Kh7 42. e7 Ra8 $1 {An important idea
creating mating nets on the back rank and securing the draw.} 43. Rg2 b3 44.
