1. Nf3 d5 2. e3 {Nowadays this system in hugely popular. Kramnik mainly tried
e3 setups in almost every possible move order. Magnus went one step further
and even started his first move with 1.e3 thrice :)} Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Be7 {
A lot depends on a player's opening repertoire what setup he will choose here
as anytime what can just transpose with d4. The main idea for white however is
rather not to play d4 and keep the a1-h8 diagonal open for a possible kingside
attack.} 5. b3 O-O 6. Bb2 c5 (6... b6 {Got popular recently. The idea is that
black doesn't commit c5 early in order not to get a hanging or isolated pawn
which typically happens after cd5-ed5-d4 with the pawn on c5.}) 7. cxd5 Nxd5 (
7... exd5 8. d4 {Is another setup where black mostly ends up with either an
isolated pawn or hanging pawns. Here the h4 ideas are stopped which happened
in the game but on the other hand white keeps little upper hand in such
structure. This is why b6 instead of c5 have been tried number of times as
well.}) 8. h4 {A new move based on a well-known idea. White tried mainly Qc2
followed by h4 in number of games.} (8. Qc2 Nc6 9. h4 {Was first seen in
Moscow Candidates 2016 between Karjakin - Anand. Then next time it occurred
after a few months when Magnus played this against me in world rapid 2016 at
Doha. This was one of the game in which he started with 1.e3!?} b6 (9... h6 {
Was not a good reaction and I immediately got into serious trouble} 10. g4 $1
Nxc3 11. dxc3 e5 12. g5 h5 13. Bc4 {was better for white in: 1/2-1/2 (40)
Carlsen,M (2840)-Ganguly,S (2668) Doha 2016}) 10. a3 {This is an obligation
with the queen on c2 hence some player tried Qb1 instead of Qc2.} (10. Bb5 Ncb4
) 10... f5 $132 {1-0 (43) Karjakin,S (2760)-Anand,V (2762) Moscow 2016}) (8.
Qb1 {Was tried by Mamedyarov in a blitz game} b6 9. Nxd5 exd5 10. d4 $6 {
1-0 (43) Mamedyarov,S (2801)-So,W (2780) Saint Louis 2018} cxd4 {[%cal Ge7b4]})
8... b6 9. Qb1 {So that was the point! Similar to Magnus idea but with the
queen on b1 in order to avoid any Ncb4 tricks.} h6 {After 38 min of thought
Bacrot reacted exactly the way I reacted against Magnus which in my opinion is
not the best way to stop white's initiative here. First of all, Ng5 is not a
threat as long as black keeps his bishop on c8 thus ready to meet Ng5 with f5.
Unless black plays h6 there is no g4-g5 attack so there is no need to rush yet.
Hence black can continue developing on queenside.} (9... Bb7 $6 {would lead to
disaster} 10. Ng5 g6 11. Nxh7 {Probably some other moves are possible too but
this is most thematic and direct} Kxh7 12. h5 f5 13. hxg6+ Kxg6 14. Nxd5 Bxd5
15. Qd1 $1 Bh4 16. Bc4 Nc6 17. Bxd5 exd5 18. g3 $18 {One of the many ways
black can get crushed in this line.}) (9... Nc6 $1 {This is similar to
Karjakin - Anand from Moscow Candidates 2016 with one exception that white
queen is on b1 instead of c2 which means white doesn’t have to waste time
with a3 for now.} 10. g4 $5 {[%cal Gf3g5] without h6 this looks a bit empty at
first sight but things are not that trivial here.} (10. Ng5 $6 {with the
bishop on c8 this makes little sense} f5 $15) (10. Rh3 f5) (10. Bb5 {This can
be one point behind keeping the queen on b1 but black has enough resources to
stop white's attack.} Nxc3 {Now this works with the queen on b1! A move that
would not have been possible with queen on c2 due to Bc6 but now the b1 queen
hangs.} (10... Bb7 $6 {By now we know why black should not pay this move :)}
11. Ng5 $1 g6 12. Nxh7 $1 {of course!} Kxh7 (12... Nxc3 13. Bxc3 Kxh7 14. h5 {
would lead to similar lines given below.}) 13. Nxd5 $1 (13. h5 $2 Nf6) 13...
exd5 (13... f5 {This is the top choice of computer which shows how pathetic
black's position is.} 14. Nf4) 14. h5 f5 15. hxg6+ Kxg6 16. Qd1 $18) (10... Na5
{These moves are always psychologically difficult to make. To put the knight
on edge when white has some potential of attacking on other wing.} 11. Bd3 (11.
Nxd5 exd5 12. Ng5 f5 13. Qd1 Bxg5 14. hxg5 Qxg5 {apparently black is fine here.
}) 11... f5 12. Nxd5 exd5 13. h5 Bf6 $132) 11. Bxc3 Nb4 12. Rh3 Bf6 {and black
is doing fine.}) 10... f5 (10... Bb7 11. Ng5 {is always risky.}) (10... Nxc3
11. Bxc3 f5 {also doable}) 11. gxf5 Rxf5 12. Rg1 $5 {[%csl Rg7]} Bf6 (12...
Rxf3 13. Nxd5 Bf8 14. Qd1 $3 Rf7 (14... Qxd5 15. Bg2) 15. Nf4 $36) 13. Qe4 {
in general, these lines would require a lot more analyses to draw any kind of
conclusion. Anyhow it’s pretty much certain that Nc6 was a far better move
than h6.}) 10. g4 {Just like what Magnus did against me.} Bb7 11. Rh3 $1 Nd7 (
11... Nxc3 12. Bxc3 Nd7 13. g5 h5 14. g6 Bf6 15. Ng5 $1 Bxg5 16. hxg5 Qxg5 17.
Rg3 {gives white good attack for a sacrificed pawn.}) 12. g5 h5 13. Bd3 (13. g6
{Engine prefers this move over Bd3} f5 14. Qd1 N7f6 15. Ng5 Qd6 {However I
don't see why white should aim for this position than what he got in the game.}
) 13... Nb4 $6 {This is almost suicidal. Knight is getting too far away from
the game and white's knight on c3 could easily be more powerful than black's
knight on b4.} (13... Nxc3 {was called for} 14. Bxc3 Qc7 15. Bh7+ Kh8 16. Be4 {
White probably still keeps some edge but nowhere close to what he got in the
game.}) 14. Bh7+ $1 Kh8 15. Be4 Nd5 {This already shows Nb4 was a poor
decision.} (15... Bxe4 16. Nxe4 {[%csl Rb4,Ge4] The difference between two
knights are visible now.}) 16. Ne2 $1 {[%csl Rh5][%cal Ge2g3]} f5 $2 {This was
truly unthinkable. Now it’s totally lost.} (16... Bd6 17. Ng3 Bxg3 18. Rxg3 {
Depressing position but not dead lost yet.}) 17. gxf6 N7xf6 18. Ng5 {[%cal
Ge4d5,Ge2f4] Now pretty much anything and everything will eventually lead to
mate.} Nxe4 19. Qxe4 Bxg5 20. hxg5 Nf4 (20... Qxg5 21. Rg3 {[%csl Rg7]}) 21.
Qxb7 {[%csl Rg7]} Nd3+ 22. Kf1 Nxb2 (22... Rxf2+ 23. Kg1 Qxg5+ 24. Rg3 $18) (
22... Qxg5 23. Rxh5+ Qxh5 24. Qxg7#) 23. Rxh5+ Kg8 24. g6 {[%cal Gh5h8,Gb7h1]
Both Rh8 and Qh1 are deadly threat for which there are no defense. A fantastic
miniature by Nepo in an extremely important match.} 1-0
