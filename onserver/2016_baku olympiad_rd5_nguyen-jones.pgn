1. d4 {(0s) In a round riched with cool games, this game was a true gem of its
kind since we hardly ever see these Tal-like attacking games in modern days.
GM Gawain Jones paid his tribute to Tal and the English squad with this
beautiful victory.} Nf6 {(0s)} 2. c4 {(0s)} g6 {(0s)} 3. Nc3 {(0s)} Bg7 {

trouble, both d6 and a7 are hanging. Something went very wrong for Gawain
Jones or.....} f4 $1 {(547s) Jones understands what the position calls for!
There is no time to wait and defend all the weaknesses.} 15. Nxd6 $2 {(644s)

Gawain Jones' idea.} (15. Bxa7 Bd7 16. Nxd6 Qe7 17. Bc5 Nxc5 18. bxc5 b6 19.

Ng3+ {(91s)} 18. Kd3 {(91s)} Rxe8 {(21s) Ok, here is the deal: Black has two
minor pieces for the sacrificed queen and his knight on g3 has an eye on the
rook on h1, the pawn on f2 is unpleasant for White to say the least and at
some point White will need to decide where to put his king.} 19. Kc2 $6 {

pawn of f2 is a real threat!} 22. Kb2 {(735s)} Be2 {(256s)} 23. Qb1 {(239s)}

Black's pieces are active and Black's initiative will soon become overwhelming.

{(74s) Although I must admit I have some doubts about the objective value of
this queen sacrifice, Gawain Jones must be praised for his bold and active
play. It reminds me of Kasparov's unsound pawn sacrifice against Karpov in
their 16th crucial game of 1985 match. That game had a similar story: Karpov
played passively and was gradually outplayed by Kasparov in what proved to be
one of the most important games in the history of chess.} (32... Re2 33. Qxb7
