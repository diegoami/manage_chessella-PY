{Usually I annotate games in order to explain what is going on in the position
in a specific game. I am going to take some time off from that role and
annotate this game merely for fun and enjoyment. I will be annotating this game
as an amateur who understands chess not so deeply. So let's get the ball
rolling.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 {The
Classical Variation of the King's Indian! Well, I have seen this happening in
countless games and I know that Black goes for an attack on the kingside and
White plays on the queenside. Usually leads to a very interesting game.} e5 7.
O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. Ne1 {This move makes complete sense to me. The knight is
going to move to d3 in order to bolster the centre and prepare c5, and when
Black is going to attack with f5, White can easily meet it with f3.} Nd7 10. f3
{I would have played Nd3, but this might just transpose.} f5 11. g4 $5 {
What?!! The first real shocker for me! Wsn't white supposed to play on the
queenside? What is this move g4 all about? I do not understand it at all.} Kh8
12. h4 $5 {Now this is going too far! Wasn't there a saying that side shouldn't
move pawns on the side of the board where he is weaker. Also not to move pawns
in front of your king! White seems to be abusing many principles and rules at
the same time. Also what is the point of this move. It's not that you are going
to launch an attack on the black king, with your king stuck on g1.} Nf6 13. Nd3
c6 $1 {I like Black's play. He has played logical moves and now tries to blast
the centre.} 14. a4 $5 {Enchev is not tired of moving his pawns! He has already
move seven of them, and six moved two squares ahead on the first move! Somehow
Black to should find a way to punish all of these moves.} b6 15. Nf2 (15. b4 $5
{I was expecting the Bulgarian to go for this!}) 15... a6 16. Qb3 Rb8 17. Be3
f4 {Black closes the centre and pushes the bishop off the best diagonal.} 18.
Bd2 {Let's take stock things here. White's pawn moves which seemed really crazy
at first, don't look so crazy anymore! He has more space and Black is at a loss
for a plan. The pawns on g4 and h4, instead of being weak are actually limiting
Black's pieces. Was it some sort of a great plan by White?} Nd7 (18... b5 $1 {I
think this move should have been tried by Black.} 19. axb5 axb5 20. cxb5 cxd5
21. exd5 Bb7 $13 {And to some extent Black has succeeded in opening up the
position.}) 19. Kg2 Nc5 20. Qc2 a5 21. Rh1 h5 22. g5 {The pawns on h4 and g5
take away space from the black pieces. The only way in which they could be a
weakness is if Black can sacrifice a piece soon on g5, but that is not
happening.} Qd7 23. Rab1 Ba6 24. b4 axb4 25. Rxb4 {With the kingside closed,
all the action shifts to the queenside, where White opened up the position with
b4 and now has a weakness on b6 to attack.} Rfc8 26. Rhb1 Qa7 27. Be1 Re8 28.
Qb2 Rb7 (28... Nd7 29. Nfd1 $16 {The bishop comes to f2 and it is going to
force c5, when Black would be very passive.}) 29. Rxb6 Reb8 30. a5 {White has
won a pawn and is well and truly on his way to wining the game.} cxd5 31. cxd5
Nc8 32. Rxb7 Rxb7 33. Qc2 Bf8 34. Bxa6 Qxa6 35. Rxb7 Qxb7 36. Nd3 Qa6 37. Nxc5
dxc5 38. Qa4 {Excellent play by Ivajlo. There is not one mistake that you can
find in the moves he has made in this game.} Nd6 (38... Qd3 39. Qe8 $18) 39.
Bf2 Nc4 40. Qe8 Kg7 41. Nb5 (41. Qc6 Qxa5 42. Qf6+ Kg8 43. Qxg6+ $18) 41...
Qxa5 42. Qd7+ Kh8 43. Qf7 (43. Qc8 $18) 43... Qxb5 (43... Bg7 {would have
survived longer. White has to find} 44. Nc7 Qa7 45. d6 Nxd6 46. Qe7 Nc4 47.
Qe8+ Kh7 48. Nd5 $18 {And with Ne7, White is winning.}) 44. Qxf8+ Kh7 45. Qh6+

{I was sitting on the board next to this game. The amateur within me learnt a
lot of things. The main one being, it is not so bad to push pawns in front of
your king and space advantage does count for a lot in the game of chess! The
analysis were more from fun point of view and not so objective, but I would say
that Ivajlo really played a fine game!} 1-0
