{An emphatic victory for Anand. Let's have a look at the game to see what
really went right for him and wrong for Svidler.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6
4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. a4 ({The following game between
Anand and Svidler with the inclusion of h3 and h6 is very similar to what we
saw today. And Svidler played much better back then.} 8. h3 Bb7 9. d3 Re8 10.

V (2779)-Svidler,P (2728) Morelia/Linares 2007}) 8... Bb7 {[%cal Gc8b7]
Although this is the main move in the position, Anand thought for a good ten
minutes. Why? Because Svidler has got the position 13 times in his games and
all the times he has chosen b4.} (8... b4 {is Svidler's move.}) 9. d3 Re8 10.
Nbd2 Bf8 11. c3 Na5 12. Bc2 c5 {This is all very standard Ruy Lopez stuff. Now
White must remain consistent and break in the centre with d4.} 13. d4 exd4 {
This came as a bit of a surprise to Anand. But Peter was mainly trying to play
very concrete chess.} 14. cxd4 d5 $6 {Although this is very thematic. It is
extremely dangerous. The main reason being that the two bishops on c1 and c2
are opened up against the black king.} (14... cxd4 {looks like the best way for
Black to proceed.} 15. e5 Nd5 16. axb5 axb5 17. Nxd4 Nb4 18. Bb1 $13 { is an
interesting game.}) 15. e5 Ne4 {This was a critical position where Anand took a
lot of time. There are a lot of captures. As Anand correctly pointed out, the
main question to him was whether to take on b5 or not. On one hand keeping the
a-file closed keeps the rook on the back rank safeguarding it. On the other
hand the rook doesn't take part in the game. It is a very difficult decision to
make and almost impossible to see what possibilites may arise after say eight
to ten moves. But this is where intuition comes into picture and Anand felt
that bringing the a1 rook into the game was more important and that explains
his next move.} 16. axb5 (16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Rxe4 {Now this exchange sacrifice
is not as effective as in the game.} (17. Bxe4 Bxe4 18. Rxe4 Qd5 $1 {Important
to blockade the d-pawn before attacking it.} 19. Re3 (19. Qe2 Nb3 $17) 19...

axb5 was better than not taking.}) 18... Nxa1 19. Qh5 Qxg5 $1 20. Bxg5 g6

here.}) 16... axb5 (16... Nxd2 $2 17. Bxd2 axb5 18. Bxh7+ $1 { wins! It's a
standard Greek Gift!} Kxh7 19. Ng5+ Kg8 (19... Kg6 20. Qg4 $18) 20. Qh5 $18)

Bxb4 22. Rxd4 Qb8 23. Qd3 $18) 17. Nxe4 dxe4 18. Rxe4 $1 { This move might be
natural for a player like Anand, but for us who are taught about the relative
value of the pieces since a young age, it is not easy to consider a such a
move. Once you see it, though, and you realize that the bishop on e4 will be a
complete monster, breathing fire in both directions, you make this move!} (18.
Bxe4 Bxe4 19. Rxe4 Qd5 $11 {gives Black excellent chances to hold.}) 18... Nb3

tournament hall to check out what exactly was going on. I expected Anand to be
looking happy while Svidler would be on the board with his head in his hands.
But the scene I saw was completely opposite. Peter had just captured the rook
on a8 and was moving around confidently. Anand on the other hand was nervous,
fidgety, biting his nails and looked as if he was the one on the back foot. But
it was clear that Vishy was calculating the details of his final attack,
anxious to make sure that his opponent had no defensive resources. And in the
above position he picked up his knight and made the best move 20.Ng5!} 20. Ng5
$1 {Svidler came back and saw this move. I thought that the Russian would think
for a while before he would make his move but he blitzed it out. He was showing
that he had it under control.} (20. Rh4 Bxf3 21. Bxh7+ Kh8 22. Rh3 Bxd1 23.

an attack on both the h7 and f7 pawns.} h6 { This move was also made quickly.}
(21... Qxg5 {was a way to avoid an immediate defeat, but doesn't really serve
any purpose as after} 22. Qxg5 Bxe4 23. Qxc1 $1 Bxc2 24. Qxc2 $18 {the position
is technically winning. It won't be so difficult for a player of Anand's
calibre to turn this into a win.}) (21... Bxe4 22. Bxe4 h6 23. Qxf7+ Kh8 24.
Qg6 $18) 22. Qxf7+ Kh8 {At this point Peter once again stood up from the board
and started walking around. Anand was making his final calculations, the other
players were all coming to the board and making faces of disbelief. Nakamura
stood right next to Svidler's seat for almost a minute. He just didn't want to
leave. He checked the scoresheet, then the board and couldn't believe that
Anand was just winning. He went back to his board, Anand lifted his hand and
once again made the only winning move in the position.} 23. Rg4 $1 {The rook
defends the knight and now the threat is Qg6. Black doesn't really have a way
to stop the attack.} (23. Rf4 Ne2+ $19) 23... Qa5 {And once again Anand has the
only move to win.} (23... Ne2+ 24. Kf1 $1 {wins!} (24. Kh1 $4 {however loses in
an amazing fashion.} Qa5 $3 {Suddenly the back rank weakness turns out to be
the critical factor in the game.} 25. h4 Qe1+ 26. Kh2 Qg1+ 27. Kh3 Qh1#)) 24.
h4 $1 {Svidler resigned as he saw no point in continuing. His bluff of playing
quickly had not worked. Many of you might be wondering why this is the only
move. Wouldn't h3 also win? The point is subtle. The h3 square has to be kept
for the knight to control g1.} (24. h3 Qe1+ 25. Kh2 Ne2 26. Nf3 Bxf3 27. gxf3
Nxd4 $17) (24. h4 Qe1+ 25. Kh2 Ne2 26. Nh3 $18 {Like a gentleman he analyzed
the game with Anand, kept a very calm face in the press conference and showed
great sportsman spirit.}) 1-0
