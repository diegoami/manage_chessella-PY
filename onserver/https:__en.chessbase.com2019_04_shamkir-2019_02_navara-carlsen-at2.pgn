sticks to his Sveshnikov, which we can say has been one of his main openings
since he played it in the London match with great success.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6
5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5 {It's interesting that Navara enters this line. Usually
the kind of positions that arise after this move are full of fight, which is
fun.} (7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 {Is usually more solid, depending on which line White
chooses further.}) 7... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8 {This is the most normal move. Black
will usually later bring the knight back into the game from d7. But first we
will see some logical developing moves from both sides:} (8... Ne7 {What
Magnus played the last time he had this position, where he won a nice game
against dutch GM Jorden Van Foreest in his previous tournament.}) 9. a4 (9. c4
{This and a4 as Navara played are the popular moves. The point is that after
the knight gets kicked with a6, it can go back to c3 or a3 without being in
front of the pawn. Also it stops Black from going b5.} Be7 10. Be2 O-O 11. O-O)
(9. Bd3 a6 10. Nc3 {and now it would be logical to have the pawn on c4.}) 9...
Be7 (9... a6 10. Na3) 10. Be2 O-O 11. O-O Nd7 {As I said this position is
generally full of fight. Black will play f5 and play on the kingside, while
white is better on the queenside and will try to push there. Magnus had this
position twice in the match against Caruana, but Navara chooses a different
move.} (11... a6 {Black can play this, but it is not necessary, as he can
always play a6 to kick the knight later. It makes more sense to develop the
knight first.} 12. Na3) 12. Kh1 (12. a5 {Now as a5-a6 is a threat, Black
always plays} a6 13. Nc3 f5 {and we get a double-edged game as usual in these
positions.}) (12. b4 a6 13. Na3 a5 14. bxa5 Rxa5 15. Nc4 Ra8 16. Be3 f5 17. a5
f4 {with an interesting fight which ended in a draw ½-½ (54) Caruana,F (2832)
-Carlsen,M (2835) London 2018}) (12. Bd2 {The point of this move is that White
wants to play a5, and after a6 be ready to play Na3 and the a5-pawn would not
be hanging. This way White will be able to bring his knight to c4.} f5 13. a5
a6 14. Na3 e4 15. Nc4 Ne5 16. Nb6 Rb8 17. f4 exf3 18. Bxf3 g5 {White was
better in ½-½ (38) Caruana,F (2832)-Carlsen,M (2835) London 2018, but
probably Magnus had some improvements in store. So Navara chooses a move which
Magnus had not faced before:}) 12... a6 (12... f5 {would probably lead to the
same after White will play f4 here.}) 13. Na3 (13. Nc3 {Does not make much
sense, as after} f5 {the knight on c3 is not great, and doesn't have many
squares.}) 13... a5 $146 {Surprise! Usually Black is not playing on the
queenside, and is always going f7-f5 directly. Obviously Magnus must have had
prepared this move, which is a novelty. The point is that Black wants to fix
the queenside pawns, and follow this up with b6, so it will be harder
for White to roll with the pawns there. And after doing that to play on the
kingside with f5.} 14. f4 {A logical move, as White usually does this anyway
after Black plays f5 in order to stop f4. White is ready to open up the
position.} (14. Nc4 Nb6 $1 {was probably the point. White can't go Na5 now,
and Black is not unhappy to exchange the knights.}) 14... f5 {This position
seems critical to me. Both sides have completed their opening moves and we have reached a
position with manouevring and many possibilities for each. That Navara
spent only two minutes on the next move took me by surprise.} (14... b6 {
this move can wait, and gives White additional options.} 15. fxe5 Nxe5 16. Nb5)
15. Nc4 $6 {The knight is generally doing OK on c4, but I liked it better on
d4. It doesn't do as much on this square.} (15. Nb5 {Seems more logical to me,
and now White is ready to meet} b6 {with} 16. fxe5 Nxe5 17. Nd4 {and the
knight gets an ideal square on d4, eyeing e6 and c6.}) 15... b6 {This is just
a move that improves the position a bit. White was not threatening anything,
so why not? Black is now able to develop the bishop on that side if he wants
to.} (15... exf4 16. Bxf4 Nc5 {was also possible, and seems double-edged.} 17.
Ra3 b6 {would transpose to the game.}) 16. Ra3 $5 {Interesting move that
brings the piece that wasn't doing anything on a1 into the game.} exf4 {
Magnus takes action in order to manage to play Nc5 so he can improve his
knight.} 17. Bxf4 Nc5 $13 18. Re3 $2 {Just a blunder by Navara. What he missed
was:} (18. Rh3 {was discussed in the press conference. This position seems
just unclear with chances for both.} Nxa4 19. Re3 {now Re3 works much better as
} (19. Bd3 Rf7) 19... g5 20. Rg3 $1 {as the Black knight left the c5-square,
there is no Ne4 here.} (20. Rxe7 gxf4 21. Re6) 20... Kh8 21. Bxd6 Bxd6 22. Nxd6
Qxd6 23. Qd4+ Qf6 24. Qxa4 $13) (18. Rg3 {Would be another interesting move,
and again the position is unclear and full of fight.}) 18... g5 19. Rxe7 gxf4

Bxe6 22. Rxf4 Bxc4 {The knight on c4 was definetly annoying, and it is logical
to get rid of it, as it is easier in practice to play for Black now.} 23. Bxc4+
Kh8 24. g4 $2 {Seems like a strange decision to me to weaken the king.
Probably Navara thought his only chance was to go active and didn't believe in
just waiting, which can be understandable. But this seems to just make it
easier for Black:} (24. g3 $17 {is more logical, and Black is much better of
course, but this seems more challenging.}) (24. Qd4+ {what Magnus thought was
critical, and is a better move:} Qf6 25. Qxb6 Qe5 (25... Rab8 26. Qxa5 Rxb2 27.

exchange queens followed by the strong Re4. And in general if Black manages to
exchange rooks as well it makes it much harder for White to defend.} 27. Bf1 Qxd4

clear. White has a pawn and is active. Seems like great drawing chances.})

strucutre.} bxc5 32. Kg4 Re1 $17) 31... Qxf2+ 32. Rxf2 Re4 {This position is

just playing this endgame extremely well and not giving his opponent any
chance. It is hard to say what Navara exactly did wrong after they exchanged the
queens.} 45. c4 Kg6 46. c5 a3 {Navara missed this completely. The point is
that Black gets the c3 square for his rook in order to stop the c-pawn.} (46...
