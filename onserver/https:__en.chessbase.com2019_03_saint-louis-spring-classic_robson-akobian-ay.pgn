1. e4 e6 {Varuzhan Akobian lives and dies by his beloved French Defense.} 2. d4

10. Bd2 Qc7 11. c3 b5 12. f5 $5 exf5 13. Nf4 {[#] Nothing new with this
concept, but it's an effective setup. At the cost of a pawn White facilitates
his development for future battle.} Nb6 14. Bd3 g6 15. O-O c4 16. Bc2 Be7 17.
b3 Be6 18. Qe1 Qd7 19. Qg3 Rc8 20. h4 a5 {[#]} 21. Bd1 ({I thought in such
position White is supposed to go} 21. Ng5 Bxg5 22. Qxg5 Qe7 23. Qg3 {as the
departure of Black's dark-squared bishop makes b5-b4 an iffy proposition.}) 21... b4 22. Be2 h6
$1 {Now Black appears to be OK.} 23. Rfd1 bxc3 24. Bxc3 Bb4 25. Bxb4 axb4 26.
bxc4 dxc4 27. d5 $5 Nxd5 28. Bxc4 Qa7+ 29. Kh1 Nxf4 30. Qxf4 g5 31. Qc1 {[#]}
Ke7 $2 {A huge melee here, but clearly Var went terribly wrong with his choice of
king's position.} ({Instead,} 31... O-O 32. Bxe6 fxe6 33. Qc4 Rfe8 34. hxg5
Nxe5 {is quite acceptable for Black. Look up the games of another relative
old-timer, Kaido Kulaots, from his victorious Aeroflot Open campaign. Kaido
castled into White's attack repeatedly, and won four games with Black!}) 32.
Bxe6 fxe6 33. Qc4 Rhd8 $2 {Another error dooms Black.} (33... Na5 34. Qxb4+ Kf7
35. Qa4 Rc7 {is barely, but holdable.}) 34. Rxd8 Kxd8 35. Rd1+ Kc7 36. Rd6 Kb7
{Arriving from the frying pan right into a raging fire.} 37. Nd4 Qa4 38. Nxe6
Nxe5 39. Qd5+ 1-0
