{An unusual move but the idea is well-known. Normally Bg5 is not regarded as
such a dangerous move with the knight not able to go to d5 via c3. Black
usually goes h6 and g5 since the well-known motif of Nxg5 does not work but at
least it forces Black to weaken his kingside structure which may play an
important factor later on.} h6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Ba7 11. Nbd2 Kg7 12. Re1 Nh7 {
Moving the knight away from the center can be seen as risky but Black seems to
have enough pieces on the d4 square. The young 17 year Dutch hope does not
need much of an invitation though!} 13. d4 g4 14. Nh4 exd4 15. cxd4 Bxd4 {
Both sides seemed happy at this point. Peter Leko has won his pawn but Van
Foreest has a vulnerable king to aim at.} 16. Nf1 Bf6 17. Nf5+ Bxf5 18. exf5 h5
19. Bf4 Bg5 20. Ng3 Kh6 {A critical position has been reached. The black king
is feeling the heat!} {[%tqu "En","There are two very good moves here. One is
spectacular but you have to see the follow up. The second looks strange but it
leaves White with a clear advantage as well. Can you see one or both?","","",
"f4c1","",10,"g3h5","",0]} 21. Bc1 $1 {The threat is a combination of f6 (line
and square clearance) and h4 since gxh4 allows Qxh5!} (21. Nxh5 $1 Kxh5 {
[%tqu "En","OK, if you don't see this move then playing 21.Nxh5! was the wrong
choice! White to play and win!","","","a1a3","",10]} 22. Ra3 $3 {Truly a
brilliant move, and the move that justifies the knight sacrifice.} Bxf4 23.
Rh3+ Kg5 24. Rxh7 Ne5 25. h4+ Kf6 26. Qd4 {The bishop is trapped in mid board!
But black still has a resource.} Qe8 {[%cal Ge5f3]} 27. Kh1 $1) 21... Bxc1 22.
Rxc1 Ne5 23. Ba2 Nf6 24. Qd2+ Kh7 25. Qg5 Rg8 26. Qh4 {Black is still hanging
on but only just. In a practical game with the clock ticking, with your king
exposed to keep finding the best moves is almost impossible! Still the
decision Leko takes seems strange since he not only gives up an important pawn
for nothing but his position as well.} Nfd7 $2 {The losing move} 27. Qxh5+ Kg7
28. f6+ (28. Ne4 $1 {Seems even stronger!}) 28... Qxf6 29. Rxc7 Kf8 {Peter
Leko has saved his king but Jorden Van Foreest has a huge positional advantage,
he does not need the king hunt.} 30. Rxb7 $16 Qg6 31. Qf5 Qxf5 32. Nxf5 Rg6 33.
