new move and it is likely that Grandelius analysed its tactical consequences
at home.} ({A previous top-level game continued with} 13... Ne7 14. Nde4 dxe4

Black gives two pieces for a rook and a pawn and stops White's attack.} 15.

good play.}) 15... Nxf5 16. Qxf5 Qxf5 17. Bxf5 Rae8 {The engines also give
this position as equal. White's e-pawn is weak and White's minor pieces find
it surprisingly difficult to find targets to attack.} 18. Kf2 g6 19. Bd3 Re6

content with a draw and did not show any intention to avoid the repetition of
moves. But Hammer wants to continue the game and play for a win. In fact,
White is definitely not worse and might even be slightly better here.} 30. Be2

game.}) 39... R6e7 40. b4 {[#]} Rxe5 $1 {After this exchange sacrifice Black
is a piece down but he will get three pawns for it - and suddenly it is White
who has to be careful.} 41. dxe5 Rxe5 42. Rg1 Bd8 43. Kf3 Bxg5 44. e4 $2 {[#]
White finally wants to get rid of the weakness which has plagued for the last
moves. However, now the black bishop finds new targets on the queenside.} ({

balanced.}) 44... Bc1 45. a4 Ba3 46. exd5 ({After} 46. b5 dxe4+ 47. Bxe4 cxb5
