{I remember I was passing by, thinking that White will most probably bring his
errantknight back to a more centralised position, so Nc3 would have been my
bet. And then} 24. g4 {came! If I were to say why did the Peruvian win, my
description would be simple: dynamic-powerful-play and smart pawn moves, which
characterized his games in Mexico City.} Ne4 25. gxf5 gxf5 26. Qd3 {And now
the question is: how to lose the pawn? Under pressure, Black went for the less
fortunate continuation, handing White a massive attack.} Nxd2 ({The more
preferable version was} 26... Kh8 27. Bxe4 fxe4 28. Qxe4 {where Black is a
pawn down as well, but now he is able to point at the knight on a2 and at the
lack of coordination between White's pieces.} f5 29. Qf3 Qb6 {with a
double-edged game.}) 27. Rdxd2 Nb4 28. Nxb4 Bxb4 29. Qxf5 $1 {Who cares about
material when the black king turned as white as a sheet?!} Bxd2 30. Qg5+ Kh8
31. Qf6+ Kg8 32. Rxd2 {This is not the most accurate way to continue but it
clearly shows the strong will to win of the Peruvian player. This attitude
backfires at times yet overall it brings a lot to those who dare. In this
particular game, it cost a half a point, as Black successfully defended with
an exchange up!} ({The alternative was} 32. Rc5 {where perhaps Emilio thought
the drawing margins after} Qxc5 33. dxc5 {are not so easy to estimate. However,
the two pieces are a good team and it seems that the two ways to prevent
mating ideas are not quite working for Black. For example:} Rce8 (33... Rcd8 {
allows} 34. Be4) 34. Bg4 {there is another available white square, on f5:)} Rd8
{Yes...computer moves, not natural but logical once we see them on the screen.}
35. Bf5 Rd5 36. Qg5+ Kh8 37. Kf1 (37. Qh5 {is not the best way to proceed, in
view of} Rg8+ 38. Kf1 Rg7) 37... Rg8 38. Qf6+ Rg7 39. h4 Rxf5 40. Qxf5 Bb4 41.
Qd7 {This line is obviously not forced but it shows that Black has to find a
magic wand and nerves of steel to defend a tough position.}) 32... Qb6 33. Be4
Qd8 34. Qf5 Qh4 35. d5 $1 {Carving the way for the last piece to join the
attack.} Rce8 36. Rd4 cxd5 37. Bd3 Qh6 38. Rxd5 Qg6+ 39. Qg5 f5 40. Qxg6+ hxg6
41. Rxa5 {The endgame was interesting as well but I believe a draw was the
most likely result, which in the end appeared on the board.} 1/2-1/2
