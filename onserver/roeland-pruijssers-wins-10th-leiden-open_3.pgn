1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nf3 d6 4. c3 Nf6 {The Pirc Defence is one of the main
openings of Hugo, an opening with which he won the last round and secured his
GM norm. In this game Pavlovic plays a slightly off-beat system which seems to
be pretty harmless against the Pirc setup.} 5. Bd3 O-O 6. O-O c5 7. h3 Nc6 8.
Nbd2 (8. d5 {might have been an interesting way to play.}) 8... Qc7 9. Re1 cxd4
10. cxd4 Nh5 11. Nb3 {White's centre looks impressive and Black needs to play
with quite some energy in order to destroy it. It would be fine to say that
White is slightly better here.} a5 12. Be3 a4 13. Nbd2 Nb4 14. Bc4 (14. Bf1 $5
Nc2 15. Rc1 Nxe3 16. Rxc7 Nxd1 17. Rxd1 $14 {With the rook on c7, this should
be better for White.}) 14... d5 $1 {Black breaks the center at the very first
opportunity he gets.} 15. a3 (15. exd5 Nf6 {Black will win back the d5 pawn
with a satisfactory position.}) 15... dxc4 16. axb4 {White has maintained his
strong centre but now Black has the bishop pair.} b5 17. e5 Bb7 $15 18. Nb1 f6
$1 {Powerful play by Ten Hertog. When you have the bishops, you must open the
position at all costs, and this is what he does.} 19. Nc3 fxe5 20. Nxe5 (20.
dxe5 Bxf3 $19) 20... Rad8 $6 {It was important to play the queen to d6 in order
to defend the e6 square.} (20... Qd6 $1 21. Nxb5 (21. Qg4 Nf6 $1 $15) 21... Qd5

25. Bg5 Qb6 26. Rad1 Ng7 27. Bxf6 exf6 28. Ng4 Bxg4 29. Qxg4 Qd6 {Black is
slightly better thanks to his superior pawn structure on the queenside.} 30.
Ne4 Qxb4 $1 31. Nc5 Rfe8 32. Rxe8+ Rxe8 33. Qf3 Qxb2 34. Ne4 Qb3 $1 {Nicely
calculated. After Nxf6, Kf7, there is no good discovered check.} 35. Nxf6+ Kf7

Black is just winning.}) 36... Qxd1+ 37. Kh2 Ne6 {A nice struggle where Hugo
understood the dynamics very well.} 0-1
