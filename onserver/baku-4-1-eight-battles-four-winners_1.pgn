1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Bg5 {Leave it up to Mamedyarov to do something weird in a
crucial game. Black could just play Bg7, but Caruana picks up the gauntlet.}
Ne4 4. Bf4 c5 (4... e5 $5 5. dxe5 Bc5 6. e3 Bb4+ 7. Ke2 {is probably not enough
for the pawn, but funny looking.}) 5. Qc2 Qa5+ 6. Nd2 f5 7. f3 Nf6 8. d5 d6
{It's unlikely the players knew, but before d6 they were following an old game
by Barsov.} 9. e4 {The expansion on the center makes sense, but it does give
Black access to many dark squares.} Na6 10. Ne2 fxe4 11. fxe4 Bg7 12. Nc3 O-O
13. Be2 Nh5 $5 {Black takes advantage of the f4 bishop's position to improve
his position with this knight maneuver.} 14. Bg5 Qd8 $6 {Perhaps believing too
much in his kingside chances Caruana decides to let Mamedyarov spoil his
kingside structure. This is not such a good idea, as White has good access to
the kingside.} (14... Nf4 15. O-O Nxe2+ 16. Nxe2 Bg4 17. Nc3 Nb4 { keeps the
position very interesting.}) 15. Bxh5 gxh5 16. Nf3 h6 17. Be3 Bg4 18. O-O e6
{Trying to open up the position, but Mamedyarov is in no mood to oblige. } 19.
Qd2 Kh7 20. Rad1 $1 {the pressure on d6 is annoying. Black doesn't want to play
e5, but what can he do?} e5 21. Rf2 Nc7 22. Rdf1 Rb8 {Whatever Caruana is doing
on the queenside, it is very obviously too slow.} 23. h3 Bd7 24. Ne2 h4 25. Kh2
b6 {this move is completely baffling to me. What was the point of Rb8, then?}
(25... b5 {at least makes some sense.}) 26. g3 {The kingside is blasted open
and Black's king is feeling the pressure.} hxg3+ 27. Nxg3 Rg8 28. Nh5 {Black
simply has created nothing.} Ne8 29. Nxg7 Nxg7 30. Bxh6 Nh5 31. Ng5+ {Black's
down material and his getting mated. White has ten thousand million ways to
win, and Mamedyarov just chose one of them. The rest doesn't need analysis.}
