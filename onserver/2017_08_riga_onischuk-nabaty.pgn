1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. c3 {a quiet sideline
which says: I have more space out of the opening and I'm not eager to refute
your Caro. It has to be said that this line is the pet line of Onischuk. A
perfect choice for the afternoon game of a double round, as Nabaty had very
little time to prepare against it. Looking at the time consumption of black,
one has to suspect that Nabaty didn't consider this little move in his prep.} (

would open up the h-file for his rook. The Ng3 would turn out to be a source
of worry for White} 9. h4 (9. Nxg6 hxg6 {[%csl Rg3,Gh8]} 10. Qf3 Qc7 11. Ne4

"small solution" for black - he avoids complications but in return, he has to
give up his strong black squared bishop} 10. Bxf4 h6 11. h5 Bh7 12. Bc4 Nbd7

Onischuk has accomplished to push his h-pawn up the board. This will guarantee
some positional threats, for example a knight on g5 or the vulnerabiltity of
the f6-square. Not a nice position for Nabaty who decides to stabilise the
king side castling short. A risky decision, as the king will come under attack
sonn after} O-O (14... O-O-O 15. Bg5 Be7 16. O-O $14 {[%csl Rf7,Rh7] and
Onischuk has the easier game, as in most of the endgames, the constant threat
of winning the h7 will make the black player suffer.}) 15. O-O Qa5 16. c4 Bxg3
{To give up the dark squared bishop is a decision one doesn't make
lightheartedly - but Nabaty felt that he needed to win control over the f5
square. Otherwise his queen would be doomed to passivity} 17. Qxg3 Qf5 18. Re1
