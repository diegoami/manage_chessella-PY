many games in this system, and I think it's a great way to play more flexibly
against the Ruy Lopez, without entering forced lines with the standard 6.Re1}

liked, trying to play c3-Bc2 quickly, without allowing Na5-c5 (which Black
still may play, but he needs to take some care)} (8. a3 {but this is the
current fashion, with numerous games, and a very important recent one} O-O 9.

show how rich the position is} Nb8 10. Ne2 Nbd7 11. c3 Bb7 12. Ng3 c5 13. Re1

this current game} Re8 11. Nbd2 Bf8 12. Re1 b4 13. a5 g6 14. Bb3 Be6 15. Ba4

the a8-rook - this was played in the 4th round} (11... Qc7 $6 12. axb5 { and

the difference}) 17... Be6 18. Qxc5 Qxc5 19. bxc5 Kd7 $1 20. Na3 Kc6 21. Rab1

try from the 2016 world title challenger, which has been repeated five times

that was played against me, and I reacted so poorly that in a few moves I had a
locked bishop in b1!} 12. a4 $5 (12. d4 $1 {transposes to a Zaitsev line, with
the correct tempos, because even though White played d3 and d4, he also brought

my opponent's plan}) 15... Na5 $1 {suddenly I have problems to avoid b3, and

space on the queen-side - not only the weakness on a6 is now fixed, but most
importantly, there is no Na5 anymore (after Rb8 let's say).} Rb8 14. Nc4 g6 $6

more than enough having already two pawns for the pieec}) 27... c5 $2 {Black's
position was already vulnerable with the pawn on c6, now it totally collapses -
cxd4 is not even a threat, because the c8 bishop is hanging} (27... Nf6 { The
position is difficult anyway, but this was the last chance for Black to try
some regrouping, it turns out that the knight on d5 is not ideally placed} 28.
