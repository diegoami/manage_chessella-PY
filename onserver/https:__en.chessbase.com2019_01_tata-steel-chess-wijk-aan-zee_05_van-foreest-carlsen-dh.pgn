1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Carlsen sticks to his repertoire from the recent World
Championship match.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5 {
The first surprise of the game. Van Foreest is a very principled player who
often favours direct openings, especially with White. However it seems
excessively brave to take on Carlsen in this line. While Van Foreest might
have spent several hours preparing this position, it is likely that Carlsen
and his team (assisted by powerful engines) had spent many weeks analysing the
following labyrinthine varitions for the World Championship. In hindsight it
would have been wiser to choose something which would have been less fresh in
Carlsen's memory.} (7. Bg5 {is the main line of the Sveshnikov Sicilian. Play
could then continue:} a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5 (9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 {leads to many
long complex variations with chances for both sides.}) 9... Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6
11. c4 ({or} 11. c3) 11... b4 12. Nc2 {with a strategic battle ahead.}) 7...
Nxd5 8. exd5 Ne7 {This was played twice by Carlsen in his recent match against
Caruana.} (8... Nb8 {also featured in two games from the World Championship
match.}) 9. c4 Ng6 10. Qa4 Bd7 11. Qb4 Qb8 {Carlsen shows his ambitious
intentions.} (11... Bf5 {featured in Game 12 of the World Championship, but it
allows a repetition of moves:} 12. Qa4 Bd7 13. Qb4 Bf5 14. Qa4 (14. h4 {
was Caruana's choice in the aforementioned game and was also played by Kramnik
at the 2018 Olympiad.})) 12. h4 h5 {With the inclusion of the h-pawn moves it
appears that neither king will find a safe haven on this side of the board.}
13. Be3 a6 14. Nc3 f5 $5 {Not quite a novelty, but Carlsen displays his
opening expertise by unleashing a rare idea.} (14... a5 {was Carlsen's choice
in one of the decisive tie-break games against Caruana:} 15. Qb3 a4 16. Qd1 Be7
17. g3 Qc8 18. Be2 Bg4 19. Rc1 Bxe2 20. Qxe2 Qf5 {and despite Carlsen's
victory, White holds the upper hand.} 21. c5 (21. O-O $14 {would have left
White with a long-term edge due to his structural superiority on the queenside.
}) 21... O-O $1 22. c6 bxc6 23. dxc6 Rfc8 24. Qc4 Bd8 25. Nd5 e4 $2 26. c7 Bxc7
$1 27. Nxc7 Ne5 28. Nd5 $2 Kh7 $1 {0-1, Caruana-Carlsen, London 2018.}) 15.
O-O-O $146 {A natural choice, if somewhat risky.} (15. g3 {looks like a safe
option}) ({while} 15. Be2 {is also playable.}) (15. Na4 $5 {was mentioned by
Van Foreest after the game, and indeed this move would have led to interesting
positions which would have suited his style:} f4 $1 16. Bd3 Nxh4 $1 {
(apparently this was suggested by Carlsen in the post mortem. Further proof of
the depth of his preparation)} 17. Rxh4 fxe3 18. Bg6+ Kd8 {with a very
double-edged position. As usual, the engine eventually assesses this as 0.00
but neither king is safe and fireworks are likely to ensue.}) 15... Be7 16. g3
O-O $5 {An interesting pawn sacrifice, most likely still part of Carlsen's
preparation.} (16... e4 {would have been my first thought. Black intends to
land the knight on e5 as quickly as possible.}) ({Meanwhile the immediate} 
16... b5 $5 {is also worthy of consideration.}) 17. Be2 {Now the h5-pawn is
indefensible.} e4 18. Bd4 $6 {A step in the wrong direction.} ({Snatching the
pawn with} 18. Bxh5 {was of course critical:} Ne5 19. Be2 b5 20. cxb5 axb5 $44
{[%cal Gf8c8,Ge7d8,Gd8a5] it is clear that Black has compensation here. There
is a simple plan of ...Rf8-c8 and ...Be7-d8-a5 while the white king is a
target. However, the b5-pawn will soon fall and if an attack fails then White
should convert his extra pawn.} 21. Bg5 $1 {looks like White's most accurate
move to nullify the black initiative.}) ({If White was too afraid to capture
on h5, then} 18. f4 {was another option:} exf3 19. Bxf3 Ne5 20. Be2 b5 21. cxb5
axb5 22. Bd4 $132 {and, compared to the game, Black's e5-knight lacks
stability.}) 18... Bf6 19. Bxf6 Rxf6 20. Qb6 $2 {Van Foreest's plan is
understandable; he wishes to prevent Black from opening the queenside.
Unfortunately queens are known to be poor blockaders, and this short-term
measure soon fails.} (20. Bxh5 {was now essential. Play could continue:} Ne5
21. Be2 b5 22. cxb5 Bxb5 $1 {(forcing the exchange of White's strong knight)}
23. Nxb5 axb5 24. a3 (24. Kb1 $6 Qa7 $15 {[%cal Ga7a2,Ga7f2]}) 24... Rf8 25.
Bxb5 Qc7+ 26. Kb1 Rfb8 $44 {with yet another position that is difficult to
evaluate. Objectively chances are still equal, although in practical terms it
feels easier to play Black.}) 20... Ne5 21. Kb1 Be8 $1 $15 {[%cal Ge8g6,Ge5d7]
Black re-routes the bishop and intends to kick the white queen away from b6.}
22. Rd2 Nd7 23. Qd4 Qc7 24. Nd1 {The start of a poor manoeuvre, but it is not
easy to offer any constructive alternatives. White's position is strategically
dubious - it lacks purpose, while Black can slowly prepare the b7-b5 or f5-f4
pawn breaks.} Ne5 {Black's knight is incredibly powerful here. It simply
cannot be challenged.} 25. Ne3 f4 $1 {Simple and strong.} 26. gxf4 Rxf4 27. Rg1
(27. Ng2 {does not help:} Rf8 28. Qe3 Qf7 {[%csl Gf2]} 29. Rf1 (29. Qxe4 Qxf2
$19) 29... Rc8 $17 {and Black holds an obvious advantage.}) 27... Bg6 28. Ka1 (
{It is a sad situation when the engine suggests jettisoning material with
moves such as} 28. Rxg6 {although Black's conversion task is not so easy:} Nxg6
29. Ng2 Rf5 $17 30. Qxe4 Qf7 31. Bd3 {and the game continues.}) 28... Raf8 29.
c5 {Desperation, but otherwise f2 falls without compensation.} Rxf2 {Black
simply gobbles the pawn.} (29... dxc5 {is also sufficient:} 30. Qc3 Qd6 $17)
30. Qc3 (30. c6 $5 {would have been my final attempt at creating confusion.})
30... Qxc5 31. Qxc5 dxc5 32. d6 Kh7 33. d7 Nf3 {Winning material. A brutal
victory from Carlsen, who pounced upon his opponent's indecisiveness to score
his first win of the tournament.} 0-1
