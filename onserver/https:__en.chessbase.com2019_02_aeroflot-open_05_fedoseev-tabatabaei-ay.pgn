with this move.} ({My first experience with this position was not in my own
game. I remember reading the notes to Game 7 of the 1966 World Championship
match between Spassky and Petrosian and being thoroughly swept away by
Petrosian's play. It's worth replaying again:} 6... Be7 7. Bd3 b6 8. O-O Bb7 9.
