1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. f3 Nc6 6. c4 {Steamrolling the
Sicilian? I don't think so...} Qb6 $1 {A timely move which expoits the
drawbacks of White's early concessions.} 7. Nc2 (7. Nxc6 bxc6) 7... e6 (7... g6
{Is another way to go. Then the position might resemble the Accelerated Dragon
a bit, where the knight sometimes goes to c2, but in those variations White's
f-pawn is on f2 and the Bishop goes to e2.}) 8. Nc3 Be7 {Objectively speaking
it is hard to determine which move White should play here. But in case you do
not wish to solve the ins and outs after ...Qxb2, then Rb1 is your move!} 9.
Bd3 {Jonathan choses a third way. He protects the knight on c2 in order to
prepare Be3.} (9. Be3 Qxb2 10. Qd2 Nb4 11. Rc1 Nd7 12. Nb5) 9... O-O 10. Be3
Qc7 {[#]What has happened? Black has wasted one move with the queen. White in
turn now has a knight which is not ideally placed on c2. The pawn on f3 is
also something white is not too happy about.} (10... Qxb2 11. Qd2) 11. O-O Ne5
{Another logical move, putting pressure on c4.} 12. Nb5 {A radical solution.} (
12. b3 {looks like a normal move, but in that case the c3-knight is hanging
and White has to watch out for ...d6-d5.}) 12... Qb8 13. Be2 a6 14. Nc3 Qc7 {
White is back to square one.} 15. Na4 {[#] At this point Tiger was happy. He
has got a position with dynamic qualities at no cost!} ({Or else} 15. Qd4 {
which is recommended by Sergey Kasparov is not to everyone's liking.}) 15...
Ned7 ({The thematic} 15... b5 {seems to work right away. As always a move like
that against a competent opponent requires long calculations and exact
judgements.} 16. cxb5 axb5 17. Nb6 (17. Bxb5 d5 18. exd5 Nxd5 19. Qe2 Bd7 $1

Nxe3 21. Rxc7 Rxc7 $5 22. Qd2 Nxf1 23. Kxf1 b4 $15) 16. Rc1 b6 {It is time for
White to chose how to expand with his Queen side pawns. The ideal plan is to
play b2-b4 and a2-a4-a5, or b2-b4 followed by c4-c5. None of these plans seems
to work right now. So hi has to bide his time. Kasparov used his Queen on f2
in a similar position against Kramnik. This seems sensible right now:} 17. Qd2
(17. Qe1 Bb7 18. Qf2 Nc5 19. Nc3 {followed by above mentioned plans.}) 17...
Re8 {A standard move. When Black is playing ...d5 the e-file used to open up,
and then the e3-bishop hangs, in the best of Black's worlds.} 18. Rfd1 Bb7 19.
Bf1 Rac8 20. Nd4 (20. b4 $1 {To b4 or not to b4, that is the question.} Ba8 (
20... Qb8 21. Nxb6 Nxb6 22. Bxb6 Bxe4 23. Bf2 Bb7 24. Nd4 {is slightly better
fro White.}) 21. Qf2 Rb8 22. Na1 $1 {followed by Nb3 gives White a solid plus.}

fxe4 Ng4 25. Qb6 Rc6 {wins for Black.}) 20... Qb8 21. b4 Bf8 {[#]Tiger
describes his position like a feather. The power will be released!} 22. Nc3 {
Tiger did not like this.} h5 {In order to prepare fiendish complications.} 23.
a3 {This was also slitghly odd according to Tiger.} Ba8 {The feather gets more
and more "cramped".} 24. Nb3 Ne5 25. Na4 b5 $5 {Tiger was not 100% sure here,
but decided to go for it anyway!} 26. cxb5 Rxc1 27. Rxc1 ({Tiger thought} 27.
Qxc1 $14 {was slightly more correct, because after Bxb5 the rook has to go to
d8 where it keeps an eye on the d-file.}) 27... axb5 28. Nb6 d5 {A dream has
came true...} 29. Bxb5 Rd8 30. exd5 Bxd5 31. Qc3 {[#] How to continue?} (31.

a human...} 32. gxf3 (32. Bd4 Bd5 $17) 32... Nxf3+ 33. Kg2 Qxh2+ 34. Kxf3 {
[#] And now?} e5 35. Bf2 Ng4 36. Qc2 $4 ({It was easy to get confused.

choose the best square for the knight.} 0-1
