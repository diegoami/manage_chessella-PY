{London was cold, snowy, sleety, rainy and windy. Although I fought hard in my
games I couldn't seem to create much heat. What to do? People seem to think
that strong players can and should win whenever they want. My guess is the
people who think that have never played the best chess players in the world in
a lengthy tournament. Everyone fights to the death and more often than not, a
win or loss can hang on one single move. Anyway, I had some great battles that
did not end decisively and now I was at the last game. My last chance and I'm
playing black against the great Anand. Hope dies hard and of course I had a
flickering hope that I might crack a win this time but hey ... I'm sure Vishy
did too.} 1. e4 (1. c4 {was a strong possibility too. From time to time Vishy
plays this, with good results.}) 1... e5 {I considered other options in move 1,
like Caro or French but since I'd prepared 1...e5 mostly for this tournament,
I decided to stick with it.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {I was happy to see this move.
I'd prepared mostly for 3.Bb5, but before this tournament I'd prepared a DVD
for ChessBase in the Italian Game. In looking at the material for the work and
familiarizing myself with the typical ideas, plans, and setups, I also noticed
that it's not easy for White to claim a clear cut advantage when Black knows
what to do.} Bc5 4. O-O {The slow classical setup. For the time being, White
just wants to castle and develop his pieces.} ({Earlier this year Peter
Svidler tried the older variation against me, but in that game I equalized
well:} 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. e5 d5 7. Bb5 Ne4 8. cxd4 Bb6 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Be3
Bg4 11. h3 Bh5 12. Qc2 Bg6 13. Qb3 Ne7 14. O-O c6 15. Bd3 Nf5 16. Rae1 Nxd4 17.
Bxd4 Bxd4 18. Nxe4 dxe4 19. Bxe4 Bxe4 20. Rxe4 Bb6 21. e6 Qe7 22. exf7+ Qxf7
23. Re6 Kh8 $11 {1/2-1/2 (29) Svidler,P (2749)-So,W (2810) Saint Louis 2017})
4... Nf6 5. d3 O-O {Here Black already has a flexible choice, with ...a6,...a5,
...d6, or ...h6 all playable alternatives. I like 5...0-0, as I keep the
option of going d7-d5 in one move and I am not necessarily afraid of the pin
Bg5.} 6. a4 ({Just the previous day, I'd been very impressed by Vishy's game:} 
6. c3 d5 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. a4 (8. Re1 Bg4) 8... a6 {Both 8...a5 and 8...Nb6
looks good too.} 9. Re1 Bg4 10. h3 Bh5 11. Nbd2 f6 12. Ne4 Ba7 13. b4 Kh8 14.
Bd2 Nce7 15. b5 axb5 16. axb5 c6 $11 {with no problems. Black's play here
looks so convincing that in fact if Vishy went for this I wouldn't have minded
playing the exact same line starting with 8...a6 against him!} 17. Ng3 Be8 18.
Bxd5 cxd5 19. c4 Bc5 20. Rxa8 Qxa8 21. d4 exd4 22. Nxd4 Bxd4 23. Rxe7 Bc5 24.
Rc7 Bb6 25. Re7 Bc5 26. Rc7 Bb6 27. Re7 {1/2-1/2 (27) Vachier Lagrave,M (2789)
-Anand,V (2782) London 2017}) ({With both our kings castled short} 6. Bg5 {
does not look dangerous, after} h6 7. Bh4 {Black can just go} g5 8. Bg3 d6 9.
c3 {And here there are many possibilities, but I like} a6 {to reserve a safe
square for my bishop.}) (6. h3 {is possible too. Black can play} d5 7. exd5
Nxd5 {but it's not the best timing, as d3 is solidly protected. So I would
prefer 6...d6.} 8. Nbd2 $14) (6. Re1 Ng4 7. Re2 {gives Black the extra option
of} Nd4 $5 ({Or perhaps even better is} 7... Kh8 8. h3 f5 $1 {1-0 (57) So,W 
(2770)-Giri,A (2785) Bilbao 2016}) 8. Nxd4 Bxd4 9. h3 Nf6 {with
simplifications.}) (6. Nbd2 {is okay too, but it blocks the bishop from
developing. Black can play} d6 7. c3 a5 8. Re1 Be6) (6. Nc3 {is not scary,
Black plays} h6 {to prevent Bg5 then} 7. Nd5 d6 $11) 6... h6 {A slight
move-order subtlety.} (6... a5 {is natural, but I assume he would go} 7. Bg5 {
which gives White extra possibilities, as now the b5 square is weak. Levon
played 3 games in 2017 with} h6 8. Bh4 Be7 {but I'm not particularly convinced
and I haven't analysed it deeply enough either.}) ({If} 6... d6 7. c3 {
threatens to trap my bishop, so} a5 8. Bg5 {and again the b5 square is weak,
but the position does not look clear at all to me.} h6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 {
I have no idea what is going on here. The difference with the pawn on a5 is
that after} Ba7 11. Na3 {White always has the option to gain time by jumping
on b5, while if I leave my bishop on c5 then its vulnerable to d3-d4.}) (6...
a6 {is another very serious possibility, but for this game I wanted to put my
pawn on a5.}) 7. c3 (7. a5 {is worthy of interest. White threatens a5-a6 so} a6
8. c3 d6 {gives a slightly different pawn structure.}) 7... a5 {I like this ...
a5 setup. Black fights for every bit of space in the queenside and controls
the dark squares very well.} 8. Nbd2 (8. d4 {gives Black many possble options:}
exd4 (8... Bb6 9. dxe5 Nxe4) 9. cxd4 Bb6 10. e5 d5 ({Or} 10... Ne8 11. Nc3 d6 {
seems to hold out well.})) 8... d6 9. h3 Be6 {Trading pieces is welcome for
Black. Other options I considered were:} (9... Re8 {with the idea of Be6 while
avoiding the doubled-pawns.} 10. Re1 Be6 11. Bb5 {is the downside, as our
knight is pinned. Black can play 11...Nd7 or 11...Bd7 with some theory
involved.}) ({Or} 9... Ne7) 10. Re1 (10. Bxe6 fxe6 {looks a little worrying to
me because of the doubled-pawns. But Black controls enough space and should be
able to fight sucessfuly.} 11. Re1 d5 ({Or} 11... Qe8 12. Nf1 Nh5)) 10... Bxc4
11. Nxc4 Re8 12. Be3 {With g5 under my control he does not have really
anything better than to exchange dark-squared bishops.} Bxe3 13. Nxe3 Qd7 ({
The freeing break} 13... d5 {does not work yet} 14. Qb3 $1 dxe4 (14... d4 15.
cxd4 exd4 16. Nf5 $14) 15. dxe4 Nxe4 16. Qxb7 Re6 (16... Qd7 17. Rad1 Nd6 18.
Nc4 $16) 17. Rad1) ({But I considered} 13... Ne7 {which is fine.}) 14. Qb3 Ne7
{I was starting to get worried over my c4-b5 light squares though closer
analysis shows White is not fast enough to exploit it. Then I decided to
transfer my knight to a better square.} ({Funnily enough} 14... Nd8 {is a
serious alternative here, given by the computer. I did not seriously consider
it during the game, but I can't find any way for White to do anything. Once my
knight gets to e6 then to f4, or c5 I consolidate.} 15. Nc4 (15. Nd5 Nxd5 16.
exd5 f5) 15... Ne6 16. d4 exd4 17. cxd4 Nf4 18. e5 N6d5 $11) 15. Nc4 Ng6 16.
Rad1 {I thought this was too slow, but the position is so sterile anyway.} ({
I told Vishy after the game that I thought} 16. Re3 {might be a bit better for
White, as he is faster on the e-file.} b6 17. Rae1 Nh5 $1 18. Kh2 (18. d4 Nhf4)
18... Nhf4 {but the computer disagrees with me anyway and it turns out that he
has problems with my knight on f4.}) (16. d4 exd4 17. Nxd4 b6 $11) (16. Qb5 {
does not lead anywhere as ...b6 is sufficient, or} c6 17. Qb3 Qc7) 16... b6 17.
Qc2 {Again this looks slow. I thought his queen was just fine where it was but
it might be needed to protect the kingside from Nf4 sometimes.} (17. d4 exd4
18. Rxd4 Re6 {gives White problems along the e-file.}) (17. Qb5 Nf4 $11) 17...
d5 {I could play other moves, such as Qc6 or Nh5 but generally if d6-d5 works
I should just go for it.} 18. exd5 ({Slightly more precise is} 18. d4 {using
the fact that my queen is vulnerable. After} exd4 19. Rxd4 Qc6 20. exd5 Rxe1+
21. Nxe1 Nxd5 22. Qe4 Nde7 $11 {it is completely equal.}) 18... Qxd5 19. b3 {
I was a little surprised with this as now its clear that I have no problems
whatsoever.} ({I expected} 19. Ne3 Qc6 (19... Qb7 20. Nc4 {draw.}) 20. d4 $11)
19... Rad8 {Centralizing the rooks.} 20. d4 exd4 21. Rxd4 Rxe1+ 22. Nxe1 Qa8
23. Rxd8+ Qxd8 {By now I realize that Vishy is probably happy to force the
draw.} 24. Qd3 $6 {This is not the best way though as the queen can be kicked
by my knights with Nf4, Nd5 etc.} (24. Nd3 Nd5 {might be a bit uncomfortable
for White.}) (24. Qd2 Qxd2 25. Nxd2 Nf4) ({I thought} 24. b4 {is the simplest,
to trade pawns and weaken my queenside.}) 24... Qe7 $1 {It is wise for Black
to keep queens for now.} ({I calculated this long line:} 24... Qxd3 25. Nxd3
Nd5 26. b4 Ngf4 (26... Nxc3 27. bxa5 bxa5 28. Nc5) 27. bxa5 bxa5 28. Nc5 Ne6
29. Ne4 (29. Nxe6 fxe6 30. Nxa5 Nxc3 {leaves me a pawn up.}) 29... f5 30. Ng3
g6 31. Ne2 Nef4 32. Nxf4 Nxf4 {But then it turns out I am not even winning a
pawn:} 33. Ne5 $1 Ne2+ (33... Kg7 34. c4) 34. Kf1 Nxc3 35. Nxg6 Nxa4 36. Ne7+
Kf7 37. Nc6 $11) 25. Nc2 Nf4 26. Qd2 N6d5 27. Kf1 (27. Kh2 Qe2 28. g3 Qxd2 29.
Nxd2 Ne6 30. c4 Nb4 31. Nxb4 axb4 $15) 27... Nxc3 28. N4e3 $2 {The losing
mistake. He still had a lot of time here. Obviously on a good day he would
have surely spotted 28.Nxb6, but in London, Vishy and Michael Adams were a bit
out of form.} (28. Nxb6 $1 {might be enough for a draw.} cxb6 (28... Qg5 29.
Ne1) 29. Qxc3 Qe2+ 30. Kg1 Qd1+ 31. Kh2 Ne2 32. Qc8+ {The point of the knight
sacrifice.} Kh7 33. Qf5+ $11) 28... Ne4 29. Qd4 c5 30. Qd1 Qf6 {Being quite
low on time, I chose a logical looking move.} ({Black wins right away after} 
30... Qh4 $1 31. Ng4 Nxh3 $1 (31... f5 32. Qd7 Qh5 {wins too, albeit a more
complicated one.}) 32. gxh3 (32. g3 Qg5) 32... Qxh3+ 33. Kg1 Nc3 34. Qd8+ Kh7 {
and White's king has no defense. I spotted 31...Nxh3! but I just couldn't
believe that it wins on the spot! Maybe I need to have more belief in myself.}
35. Nh2 Ne2+ 36. Kh1 Qf5 $19) 31. Ng4 ({Resistance could've been much tougher
with} 31. Qd7 {threatening Qe8 check.} Kh7 32. f3 Ng3+ 33. Kf2 Qh4 34. Qg4 $17)
(31. f3 Ng3+ 32. Kf2 Qh4 {is a bit different as White has no Qg4.}) 31... Qc3
32. Nce3 h5 33. Nh2 Qb2 {Here Vishy had to resign, as he will inevitably lose
a second pawn. An unexpected win for me! It's quite difficult to win with the
Black pieces against players of this caliber. You need to be in really good
form, or your opponent in really bad form. As I missed chances against
Nepomniatchi and Aronian earlier in the tournament, this win was received with
a big sigh of relief!} 0-1
