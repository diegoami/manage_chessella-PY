{I am not going to comment on this final game, as it was a ping-pong match,
with too many missed chances for both sides. However, the ensuing endgame, for
which I have a pale satisfaction as I deliberately went for it, is really
interesting! Black is a piece down yet with a very active king and an extra
pawn on the queenside! Objectively speaking, I believe it should be a draw but
playing this position on seconds is far from ideal, especially for White.}
44... Ke5 {The plan is simple: marching down to capture the b2 and a3 pawns.}
45. Bc2 ({Apparently, White has to keep the bishop on the a8-h1 diagonal, where
the minor piece is more active and entitled to set up some threats.} 45. Ba8

most likely the outcome.}) 45... Kd4 46. Kg2 Ke3 47. h4 Kd2 $4 {I almost fell
from my chair... with my clear plan in mind I quickly went to d2, trying to
save and add some seconds on my clock.} ({The problem is that I missed} 47...
Ke2 $1 {winning a piece! Oops!} 48. Nf3 Bc6) 48. Kf2 Kc1 49. h5 Bf5 { In fact I
was quite pleased with this "technical" move, thinking the poor knight would be
too weak to stop all my pawns!} ({Apparently} 49... gxh5 { was the right way,
which I dismissed on the grounds that more pieces, more chances for a draw for
White. Turned out I was wrong.} 50. Bxh7 Kxb2 51. Nc2 Bg4 52. Ke1 c3 53. Bg6
Be6 54. Ke2 Bb3 {with a winning endgame.}) 50. hxg6 $2 { returning the favor;
but the reasons are far from obvious...} (50. Bxf5 { Would have made a draw and
yet, calculating all of it is nearly impossible. The point is that keeping the
h-pawns on the board hands White the chance to hold the pawn endgame, once the
knight has been sacrificed on the other side!} gxf5 51. Ke3 Kxb2 52. Kd2 Kxa3

might prove helpful. And it did!} (50... hxg6 $2 {is wrong because of the same
reasons: a drawn pawn endgame for White} 51. Bxf5 gxf5 52. Ke2 Kxb2 53. Kd2
