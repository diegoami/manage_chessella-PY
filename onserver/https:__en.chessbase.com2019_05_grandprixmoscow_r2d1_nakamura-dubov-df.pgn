1. c4 Nf6 {Obviously it is a matter of taste, but normally if people want to
play a Symmetrical English structure they would do it immediately: ...c5, so
as to keep the option of ...Ne7 open in the case of a kingside fianchetto.
However, Dubov really does not mind Tarrasch-related move orders, because
that's what he wants to play.} 2. Nc3 c5 3. g3 e6 4. Nf3 d5 (4... b6 {is
actually a more common move, so terrible is the reputation of the Tarrasch
these days. Now, we are quite likely to get a Hedgehog structure, though
nothing is for sure yet. On the White side Dubov went} 5. Bg2 Bb7 6. O-O Be7 7.

advantage.} Nbd7 10. cxd5 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 exd5 12. Ng4 Nf6 13. Ne3 Qd7 $11 {

8. O-O O-O 9. Bg5 {is the old main line- 9.dxc5 is also possible- but now
everyone has moved over to meeting it with Ntirlis'} c4 {which I believe gives
equality.}) 8. Nxd4 Bc5 $5 {This move is uncommon, because it offers either
the bishop-pair or a pawn.} (8... Be7 9. O-O O-O 10. Bf4 Bg4 {is the main line,
and noteworthy is the following bit of -presumably-preparation from a top
French player:} 11. h3 Bh5 12. Nf5 d4 13. Nb5 Bc5 14. Rc1 Bb6 15. Nfd6 $5 {
Double-edged, but it seems not to work so well. Maybe the same idea works with
g4 inserted?} Qd7 16. Nxb7 Nb4 17. Qa4 Nbd5 18. Nc5 Bxc5 19. Rxc5 Nxf4 20. gxf4

preparation, he would have instead opted for the simplifying} 10. Nxd5 Be6 $1 (

especially convincing.}) 11. Nc3 $5 (11. Nxb6 Qxd1+ 12. Kxd1 axb6 13. Bxc6+ (
13. Nd2 O-O 14. Bxc6 bxc6 15. b3 $11 {Black has reasonable compensation, but
should take care to recoup the pawn as fast as possible, because the
compensation won't last forever.}) 13... bxc6 14. Kc2 Bf5+ 15. Kd1 $11 {
Likely draw by repetition.}) (11. e4 $5 {This is most principled, but the
light squares are weakened a bit.} Bg4 12. Qc2 (12. Qd2 Nxd5 13. Qxd5 Qf6 14.

has a lot of untangling to do.}) 11... Qe7 12. Bf4 Rd8 13. Qc1 Nb4 $1 (13...

better here.}) 14. O-O O-O {Black is clinging on for compensation here.}) (10.

considered especially promising.}) 13. Nxb6 axb6 14. e3 {The most principled,
and definitely still within Dubov's preparation. At some point- now, or in the
next 5 moves- he was at 1:35, i.e. a gain of 5 minutes!} (14. Bxc6 bxc6 15.
Qxd4 Qxd4 16. Nxd4 c5 $1 {The position is extremely tricky, but it seems that
White has no concrete way to make any of the back-rank/knight-fork tricks work,
for instance after} 17. Nb5 Rxe2 18. Rfe1 Rxa2 $1 19. Bxf6 gxf6 20. Nc3 Rxe1+

care.}) 14... d3 $5 ({One does not prepare such lines just to play} 14... dxe3

with ideas like ...Ng4 or ...Re5-h5.}) 15. Bxf6 gxf6 (15... Qxf6 16. Qxd3 Qxb2
17. Rfb1 Qf6 18. Nd4 {is also playable, but I would tend to believe the engine
verdict that White is slightly better. In practice what this means is that
Black will be lucky to trade off the queenside pawns in the ending that is
almost certainly coming.} Nxd4 19. Qxd4 Qxd4 20. exd4 Rd8 $14 {At a minimum,
White needs to play a3 before going for the ending with an extra a-pawn, but
it may be possible to arrange this, since Black needs many moves (like ...Rd6,
...Ra7, ...Kf8, ...Bd7, ...b5) to obtain a solid structure.}) 16. a3 {This is
the move which Yuffa & Miroshnichenko expected would be played. White is not
able to play (not knowing the position) anything maximalist- for mate, or for
the win of the d3-pawn- so instead he just brings the rook to c3.} (16. Qh5 Re5
17. Qh4 $13 {If White has an advantage against this system it is likely to be
with moves like these, but personally it seems to me like ...b5 and ...Ra4!?
is an adequate counter.}) 16... Be6 $1 {Still preparation.} ({It was possible
to play similar ideas after} 16... Bf5 17. Rc1 Rc8 {but maybe it is relevant
that Nd4 would be a 'real' tempo on the f5-bishop in that case.}) 17. Rc1 Rc8
18. Rc3 (18. Bxc6 $5 {Again this is a somewhat critical continuation.} Rxc6 (
18... bxc6 $2 19. Rc3 c5 20. Rxd3 Qe7 21. Nc1 $16) 19. Nd4 Bh3 $5 {is a useful
tactical resource to know about. I was considering the mate attempts like} (
19... Rxc1 20. Qxc1 Qd5 21. Rd1 $14) 20. Qh5 $2 {but every single one of them
fails for some funny reason. Here, that reason is} (20. Qxd3 Qd5 21. f3 Bxf1

because he alone has the right to equalise the material when he feels like it.}

totally lost.}) 18... Ne5 19. Nd4 Rxc3 20. bxc3 {Here, it seems preparation
ended and Dubov had to decide which square to place his queen on. The
alternatives like ...Bd5 don't work so well.} Qc7 $5 (20... Bg4 21. f3 Bh5 22.
g4 Bg6 23. e4 $14 {You would be hard-pressed to find a Russian player who
willingly took on a bishop as classically bad as the one on g6. Indeed, this
will usually lead to bad endings where Black has to sacrifice it for 2 or (if
lucky) 3 pawns.}) (20... Qe7 21. Qd2 Ra8 $132 {seems valid too, with similar
play to the game.}) (20... Bd5 21. e4 (21. Re1 $1 $14 {is the odd computer
suggestion for an edge}) 21... Bc4 22. Qh5 b5 $13 {This is an interesting way
in which Black could have played directly for a win if he'd had further
analysis after move 20.}) 21. Qd2 Bd7 (21... Qc4 22. Bxb7 Bd5 23. Bxd5 Qxd5 24.
Qd1 Qe4 $13 {This is a perfectly decent pawn sacrifice, but if the tricks fail
Black will really suffer.}) 22. Re1 {White lacks an improving move, since he'd
like to play both Rb1 and Bxb7 in one move each in the event of pawn trades,
but h4 is too weakening and nothing else can move.} (22. Be4 Qc5 $11) (22. Rc1

really wants to win.}) 22... Rc8 23. Rc1 Qc5 24. f4 Nc4 25. Qxd3 Qxa3 26. Rb1

computer indicates that} 27. Nb5 $1 Nxd3 28. Nxa3 Rxc3 29. Nb5 Bxb5 30. Rxb5 {
is fine for White. Still, maybe there was a way for Black to get in a few more
moves of chess here if he can activate the king while giving up only one of
the b-pawns.}) 27. Ne2 $2 ({The position is such that White should be
proactively repeating moves before Black gets something like ....b5 in.} 27.
Rb3 Qc5 $5 28. h3 {Now to try and win the c3-pawn Black has to play his bishop
out first with} Ba4 $5 {but here} 29. Rb4 b5 30. Ne2 $1 $11 {is an option.})
27... Bf5 $6 {A forgiving move, but to be honest Black's preparation had
succeeded anyway.} (27... Bg4 $1 {Black has great winning chances after this
move, because of the co-ordination of queen and knight. Probably White should
give up a pawn and grovel.} 28. h3 (28. Rxb6 $6 Bxe2 29. Qxe2 (29. Qxd6 $2 Qc1+
30. Kf2 Qc2 $1 $19 {For me, this move is a non-obvious detail at a distance of
3 moves.}) 29... Rxc3 $17 {Black's co-ordination is superb and he wins at
least a pawn by force.}) 28... Bxe2 29. Qxe2 Rxc3 30. Qb2 $1 b5 31. Qxa3 Rxa3
32. e4 $1 {Black can ask a few more tricky questions here, and the
time-pressure could also play a factor, though the position should really be a
draw, e.g.} Rxg3 33. Kf2 Ra3 34. e5 Ra2+ 35. Kg1 fxe5 36. fxe5 Nc4 37. Rxb5 Ra5
38. Rxb7 Nxe5 $15 {and Black can play this for a while}) 28. e4 {With a
sensible draw offer- probably Black would play ...Qc5+ and ...Be6 in case it
wasn't made.} 1/2-1/2
