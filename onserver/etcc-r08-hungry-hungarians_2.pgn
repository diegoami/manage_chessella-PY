{This game is highly unusual and shows perfectly how Richard Rapport likes to
play.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 {The Trompowsky!} d5 3. e3 $5 {Maybe he doesn't really
want to take on f6 and play the Trompowsky, he would like to play the Torre?!}
c5 4. Nc3 $5 {Veresov?!!} e6 5. Nf3 {This my dear friends is no opening system.
It's just a cocktail of all the respectable opening lines to create an unusual
variation.} Nc6 6. a3 $5 {For normal people like me this move would mean
playing dxc5 followed by b4. But on Planet Rapport it means creating a square
on a2 for your c3 knight!} Be7 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. Bd3 O-O 9. O-O Be7 {Black has a
very comfortable position out of the opening, but then Richie never really
tried for an opening advantage, did he?} 10. e4 d4 11. Na2 $5 {See how the move
a2-a3 was useful!} e5 (11... a5 {trying to stop Nb4 is met with} 12. e5 $1 Nd5
13. Bxe7 Qxe7 14. Nc1 $14 {And White is clearly better.}) 12. Nb4 Nd7 13. Bd2
a5 14. Nxc6 bxc6 15. b4 axb4 16. axb4 Bb7 17. Qe2 Qb6 18. c3 Rxa1 19. Rxa1 dxc3
20. Bxc3 Bxb4 21. Rb1 c5 22. Nxe5 Nxe5 23. Bxe5 {The last few moves have been
pretty normal, nothing unusual. The position is round about equal.} Re8 24. Ba1
Qe6 (24... Bc8 {re-routing the bishop to e6 looks quite good.}) 25. f3 Ra8 26.
Bc4 Ba6 {Getting into a tactical melee against Rapport is not such a great
idea.} 27. Qb2 $1 {Threatening a mate on g7.} Qg6 28. Qa2 {The bishop on a6 is
pinned and there's pressure on the f7 pawn.} Bb7 29. Rd1 $1 {Back rank weakness
reminder.} h6 30. Qb2 {Rd7 is quite a deadly threat now.} Bc6 31. Qe5 $1
{Basically there is no real threat in this position, but the black pieces are
just so badly tied down. The queen has to defend g7, the bishop on c6 has to
taken care of a rook invasion on d7 and the bishop on b4 is practically out of
the game. The rook on a8 looks free to move, but what can a lone man do!} Kh7
32. h4 $1 {With the deadly threat of h5 Qg5 Bxf7.} f6 33. Qc7 $1 Be8 34. Be6
{Bf5 is a monsterous threat.} Kh8 35. Qb7 Ra3 36. Qe7 $1 {The check on f8
cannot be prevented. What a game by Rapport! Unusual opening, creative
middlegame play and then razor sharp calculation to finish off the game! He is
truly a great player.} 1-0
