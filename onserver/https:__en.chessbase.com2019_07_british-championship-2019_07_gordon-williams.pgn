{would be more sensible. In fact in the main-line g3 Kings indian the plan of .
..c6 followed by ...Qa5 is fairly common, and it's something that I've toyed
with myself. In that line the White pawn is already on c4 and in that case
Black can counterattack with ...Qa6 and ...b5, but here he is denied that
option, so Gordon's last move was fairly smart.}) 9. g4 $1 {[#]} Bxg4 $2 {
This is far too much.  Before the game I spent some time with Simon, and he
seemed extremely nervous, much more so than normal. I think he realized the
importance of this game and was cramming in some last minute preparation, when
he might have been better placed trying to get himself in a relaxed mindset. 
In sports psychology they talk a lot about the value of emphasising process
over the end result. In other words, don't get ahead of yourself and start to
think about winning. Perhaps Simon, in a slightly nervous state, was already
thinking about the winning post in this game, and if so this sacrifice was the
result and it was far too early. Black lacks the resources to launch such a
crude attack.} 10. hxg4 Nxg4 11. Nbd2 f5 12. Re1 $1 Nd7 13. Nf1 {Gordon
chooses a quiet approach, to try and repel Black's attack.} ({It probably says
a lot about the contempt that the machine has for the effectiveness of Black's
attack, that one of it's top choices was the seemingly irrelevant} 13. a4) ({
During the game I was beating the drum for} 13. e4 $1 {and expected Gordon to
punch that one out. For some reason I then made some weird comparison with the
James Cameron film Aliens, when towards the end Ripley is rescued from a
burning platform by Bishop. When in the spaceship and trying to escape from
the forthcoming thermo-nuclear explosion, Ripley implores Bishop to "Punch it
bishop".   Nevertheless here, as in the film, it makes some sense for White to
play in a slightly quicker way, as by creating threats himself he is likely to
make Black's attack look even more redundant.} fxe4 14. Nxe4 {and the
sacrifice on f3 doesn't work, and otherwise the knight on e4 will hop to g3 or
even to g5 at it's leisure.}) 13... Ndf6 14. e3 $1 Ne4 15. Re2 g5 16. N3d2 Nef6

a threat of Nf5. White also has f3 as a defensive resource, so already it is
clear that White is completely winning.  In Simon's defense he was quick after
the game to disparage the sacrifice on g4. I guess it was just a bad day at
the office, or a bad day at the leisure center.} Nh6 (21... e6 22. f3 $18) 22.
