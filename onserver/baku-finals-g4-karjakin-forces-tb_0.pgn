1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 c5 3. c4 cxd4 4. cxd5 Nf6 5. Qxd4 Qxd5 6. Nc3 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 {
Karjakin has shown in this World Cup that he is not afraid of going into
symmetrical positions in must-win situations. He holds a slight advantage in
this position due to his superior development.} Bd7 (7... a6 {is certainly
considered the main line.}) 8. Ndb5 Kd8 {The king does not feel comfortable
here, but this seems to be part of Svidler's idea considering how much time he
used on the clock.} 9. Be3 Nc6 {There's only a handful of games in this
positions, surprsingly two of three o them from this year. None of them
continued with f3, though.} 10. f3 (10. h3 a6 11. Bb6+ Kc8 12. Nc7 {
Heimann-Ulibin, 2015. White eventually won this game.}) 10... h5 {I assume this
move is to prevent g4, but it seems rather drastic and it weakens g5.} ( 10...
e5 11. O-O-O Kc8 12. g4 h6 $14) 11. O-O-O Kc8 12. Bg5 g6 13. Nd6+ $1 exd6 14.
Bxf6 {Now Black is saddled with a permanent weakness on d6, and also on d5.
Karjakin can be very happy with this position. After only 14 moves he has a
clear positional advantage.} Rg8 15. e4 Be6 16. Kb1 Kd7 17. Nd5 Bg7 18. Bxg7
Rxg7 19. Bb5 {Black isn't losing anything right now, but his awkward rook on
g7, problems with d6 and lack of a plan make his position very unpleasant.} Kd8
20. Rd2 {Meanwhile, White's play is rather obvious.} Bxd5 21. Rxd5 Kc7 22. Rc1
Re8 23. Rd4 {I'm not sure I understand moving the rook back.} (23. Ba4 {
immediately with the idea of b4 looks more active.}) 23... Re5 24. Ba4 b5 $1
25. Bb3 Rc5 $1 {Getting some activity while he can, Svidler tries to push back
White's pieces and force some trades.} 26. Rd5 Rxc1+ 27. Kxc1 a6 28. Rd3 g5 {
it is intuitive to keep the pawns on black squares, but here it was more
important to liberate the rook.} (28... f5 $1 {I think would have solved most
of Black's problems. The pawn structure after} 29. exf5 (29. Kd2 fxe4 30. fxe4
Re7 $11 {Black will have a superb knight on e5.}) 29... gxf5 {looks ugly, but
Black's activity is strong:} 30. g3 h4 $1 31. gxh4 Rh7 {with equality.}) 29.
Kd2 h4 30. Rc3 Kb6 31. Rd3 Kc7 32. Ke3 f6 33. Rc3 Kb6 34. Rd3 Kc7 35. Rc3 Kb6
36. Bd5 Ne7 37. Kd4 {Now White can continue pressing. Black's rook is still
quite bad, and it was not too late to play f5, trying to get some activity.}
Rh7 38. Be6 Rh8 39. a3 Rd8 40. Rc2 Rh8 41. Rf2 Ng6 42. Kd5 Rd8 43. Bf5 Nf4+ 44.
Kd4 {Black is in trouble. He is quite passive and g3 is coming, but he still
has resources.} Re8 (44... d5 $1 45. e5 $1 (45. g3 dxe4+ 46. Ke3 (46. Kxe4 Re8+
47. Kd4 Ne2+ {picks up g3.}) 46... Nd5+ 47. Kxe4 Rd6 {close to equal.}) 45...
fxe5+ 46. Kxe5 d4 47. Rd2 Kc5 {White is still better, no doubt, but there isn't
anything clear yet.}) 45. g3 Ne6+ 46. Bxe6 Rxe6 47. Kd5 $18 {Black loses a pawn
and because of the difference in activity the endgame is simply hopeless.} Re5+
48. Kxd6 hxg3 49. hxg3 g4 (49... a5 50. g4 {White eventually swings the rook to
attack f6 and wins.}) 50. fxg4 Rxe4 51. Rf4 $1 {The last detail to win the
game.} (51. Rxf6 Rxg4 {should be winning but it's not as clear.}) 51... Re3 52.
Rxf6 Rxg3 53. Ke5+ Kb7 (53... Kc5 54. b4+ Kc4 55. Rc6+ Kb3 56. Kf4 Rg2 57. Rxa6
{is equally bad.}) 54. Kf5 {The pawn supported by the rook and the king easily
advances.} Rb3 55. g5 Rxb2 56. g6 {Black won't create any kind of activity, the
passed pawn is unstoppable.} 1-0
