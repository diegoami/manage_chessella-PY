1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {What else to expect from
the brave MVL!} 6. f3 e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. Be3 h5 9. Qd2 Nbd7 10. Nd5 Bxd5 11. exd5
g6 12. Be2 Bg7 {This is one the main position in h5 system of the Najdorf
English attack. Huge number of top games have reached here and exclusively
white always went for 13.0-0 while few players tried 13. Na5. MVL himself had
this position as black twice and one of them was against Magnus in 2018 Biel.
Peter shows an entirely different approach to play from white side.} 13. O-O-O
$5 {It was never seen at top level before although there are many games at
correspondence chess.} (13. O-O a5 14. a4 O-O 15. Bb5 Qc7 16. c4 $14 {1/2-1/2 
(49) Carlsen,M (2842)-Vachier Lagrave,M (2779) Biel 2018}) 13... O-O $146 {
Both 13...b5 and 13...Qc7 are critical reply and mostly will gain more
popularity in future.} 14. g4 (14. Kb1 {All correspondence games that reached
this position went this way.}) 14... a5 (14... e4 15. gxh5 exf3 16. Bxf3 Ne5
17. Be2 {White is faster here.}) 15. a4 Nb6 16. gxh5 Nxh5 17. Bb5 {Peter was
playing very fast till here showing the depth of his preparation. Outcome of
the opening has been a clear success for Peter who now enjoys an overwhelming
position with almost no risk.} Nf6 $2 {Problem with this move is it doesn’t
really create a threat and Peter after a long thought comes up with an
excellent antidote.} (17... Qc7 {[%cal Gb6c4] would have been better} 18. Qc3
$5 {Unsual way to swap the queens.} (18. Qd3 Rfc8 {[%cal Gb6c4]}) 18... Qxc3
19. bxc3 Nc8 20. Nd2 $14 {White keeps some pressure}) 18. h4 $1 {Peter thought
for an impressive 48min here and found the strongest move.} Qc7 (18... Nbxd5 {
runs into} 19. Bg5 $16 {and black must either allow h5 or simply give up d6
pawn and get into a horrible endgame.}) (18... Nfxd5 {There are simply too
many options for white to crush through.} 19. Bxb6 (19. Bh6 $16) (19. Bf2 $16)
19... Nxb6 20. Qxd6 {Would be the perfect Leko-way to win the game.}) 19. h5 $1
{Another 18min of thought and once again the strongest move. Now white is
winning} Nxh5 20. Bh6 $2 {Ironically Peter just spent less than one minute to
play this move while he could have finished the game right away with a
Non-Leko move.} (20. Rxh5 $1 {It’s true that Peter doesn't sacrifice much in
his games but in this particular case it all came down if he could spot one
particular move.....} gxh5 21. Bh6 f5 {It is for sure that Peter considered 20.
Rh5 but didn't see a concrete way here.} (21... f6 {also leads to the same
tactics mentioned below.} 22. Bxg7 Qxg7 23. Qe3 Qc7 24. Rg1+ Kh8 25. Bd3 $1 $18
) 22. Bxg7 (22. Rg1 Rf7) 22... Qxg7 {While considering 20.Rh5 unless the
following trick is spotted it is not possible to enter this line.} (22... Kxg7

Qe3 $1 {[%cal Ge3b6,Gd1g1]} (23. Qf2 $2 Qh6+ {allows black to get away from
the pin with a check!}) 23... Qc7 24. Rg1+ Kh7 25. Rg5 $1 $18 {Unless this is
seen it is not really possible to enter the Rh5 line.}) 20... Nf4 $8 21. Bxf4

[%cal Ge7e5]} 23. c3 Qe5 24. Qd2 $14) 23. Qe4 {no other ways to protect} Nxa4 {
After 16 min of thought MVL went for the human way. This indeed looks very
tempting. Machine has other way to solve black's problem but psychologically
it is almost impossible to find such ideas during a game. It is much more easy
to find Na4 which comes more naturally.} (23... Nc4 {This is the very first
move that anyone would consider} 24. Nd4 {However, upon seeing Nd4 one has to
now justify the previous move as nothing seems to make big progress.} Ne3 (
24... Qc5 25. c3 Nxb2 26. Kxb2 Qxc3+ 27. Ka2 Qb4 {[%cal Gc8c3]} 28. Qb1 $1 {
white consolidates.}) 25. Rd2 (25. Qxe3 Bxd4 {This wont be an issue of course})
25... Nc4 {Weird move but still will come to mind just to see if this forces
repetition.} 26. Rg2 $1 (26. Rdh2 Qc5 {Now that d4 knight is hanging} 27. Rd1

Kf8 29. Rh4 Qxd4) 27... Nb6 (27... Qb4 28. c3 Na3 29. Bc6 bxc6 30. Rxg6 $1 {
The point of having the rook on g2 instead of h2}) 28. Kb1 (28. Ne6 Qb4) 28...
Qxd5 29. Qxd5 Nxd5 30. Nf5 Nf4 31. Rg4 gxf5 32. Rxf4 $14 {There are many more
complex lines and it could easily be possible that white has improvement
somewhere. What MVL did in the game is a practical choice where all of a
sudden white now had to defend.}) 24. Bxa4 b5 25. Bxb5 a4 26. Nd4 a3 27. Bc6 $1
{Peter keeps his cool and starts defending. White is clearly better and just
needs to consolidate further, something that Peter is extremely good at.} axb2+

makes zero sense in human brain.} 29. b3 $16) 28. Kd2 Ra2 (28... Ra3 $5) 29.

specially with time pressure approaching.} (30... Ra3 31. Qd3) 31. Bxa4 Qxc3+

Tranposes to the game}) 32... Qc1+ (32... Bxd4 $1 33. Bc6 (33. Bc2 Bf6 $44)

best moves and showed huge class but now things starts to drift a bit due to
time pressure.} 35. Nc6 $2 (35. Rh4 $1 {would have sealed black's fate but
this once again doesn't fit in to human logic easily. The point is as soon as
once sees 35.Rh4 he also sees the counter 35...Rc4} Rc4 {Why would someone
voluntarily pin himself in such a way that the piece is lost immediately!} 36.
Rxb2 $1 Bxd4 (36... Rxd4 37. Rb8+ {is not difficult to see}) 37. Rd2 $1 {
This move however could be very difficult to spot in time pressure. Instead of
giving a check on b8 white simply threatens the d4 bishop which can't be saved.
Suddenly now black is pinned!} (37. Rb8+ Kg7) 37... Qe8+ 38. Re4 $18 {The
final touch.}) 35... Re8+ 36. Kf2 {[%cal Gf2g3] If the king gets to g3 it
would be difficult to form any kind of counter play} Qf4 $3 {Prophylaxis are
important everywhere. Being a rook down black doesn't rush. First Kg3 is
stopped and now Bf6-Bh4 is coming. All white's advantage has evaporated by now.
} 37. Rbe1 $2 {Probably already under time pressure and a bit frustrated by
getting into this mess from total domination Peter now makes the final blunder
after which there will be no return.} (37. Rh3 {was time to bailout. There are
many moves to do so and this is one of them.} Qc1 (37... Bf6 38. Kg2) 38. Rh1

approach. First getting rid of 40 moves and then deciding if to make a draw or
look for something more!} 40. Kf2 Qh2+ 41. Kf1 Bf6 $1 $19 {[%cal Gf6h4] Now
after consuming some more time MVL figured out he is now on driver’s seat.}
42. Rd1 Bh4 43. Qd4 Bg3 $1 {[%cal Gb2b1] Black now gets back the piece. Rest
of the game was just mere formality.} 44. Nb4 b1=Q 45. Rxb1 Qh1+ 46. Ke2 Qxb1
