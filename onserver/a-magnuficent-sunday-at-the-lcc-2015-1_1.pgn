Both the players reached this point quite quickly. After that Aronian sank into
deep thought. Black has stopped 0-0-0. Let us try to understand the various
imbalances in the position. It somehow resembles the Berlin because Black's
pawn majority on the queenside doesn't seem so potent. White on the kingside
has a working majority although the pawns are doubled. Meanwhile Black's
development is quite smooth. He can move his bishop to e6/f5 and connect the
rooks. White has to figure out where he would like to place his king. Let's see
how the game proceeds.} 12. h4 $5 { [%emt 0:06:13] Planning to exchange the
light squared bishops. Once the bishops are exchanged the king would feel safer
on e2.} g6  13. Bh3 $6 {[%emt 0:05:38] This move seems logically fine but it
doesn't help White to get an advantage. After the game Levon suggested a better
try was to play Ne4!?} (13. Ne4 $5 Nxe4 14. fxe4 h5 15. Be5+ Bd6 16. Bc3 Be6
17. f4 $14 { and it seems like White has something to bite on.}) 13... Bxh3 
14. Rxh3  Kd7 $1 {[%emt 0:14:08] A very strong maneuvre underestimated by
Aronian. The king stands excellently on e6.} 15. Rd1+  Ke6  16. Rxd8  Bxd8 $5 
(16... Rxd8 {would be a natural recapture but after} 17. Ke2 { the rook has no
entry points on the d-file and it has to anyway return to b8 to break on the
queenside.}) 17. Ke2  Rb8 {[%emt 0:03:16] Black plans to break on the queenside
with b5. If White takes it straightens out the pawn structure and if he doesn't
then bxc4 would give the black rook a lot of activity.} 18. Nb1 {[%emt 0:12:20]
Levon comes up with the idea to defend c4 with his knight. But it loses time.}
