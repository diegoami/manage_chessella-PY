black king was based initially on control of the dark squares. Tiviakov was
prepared for this: Many defenders in the immediate vicinity of his king keep
everything covered. The rooks are connected and he even has an extra pawn in
reserve.} 20. Nf4 $1 {Somehow, White has to make progress. By knocking out the
defender on e6 he opens up access to the kingside for his queen.} Nxf4 21. Qxf4
Qf7 $1 {The queen is naturally a strong defender and she's very secure here.}
