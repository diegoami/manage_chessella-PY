1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {Two games in a row for Caruana against the Ruy
Lopez. These days it is normal to expect the Berlin starting with 3...Nf6.} 4.
Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. d3 {Caruana plays 6.d3 variation, the same as he did
against Levon Aronian in the previous round.} b5 7. Bb3 d6 ({Aronian's} 7...
O-O {was met by Nc3 in the previous round.}) 8. a4 Bd7 9. c3 O-O 10. Bc2 b4 11.
Re1 Re8 12. Nbd2 {Leko-Caruana and Karjakin-Aronian are the two main games
that have reached position.} Bf8 $146 {First new move of the game. But
definitely not prepared at home. Both the players were take quite a lot of
time to make their moves.} (12... Na5 {had been previously played.} 13. cxb4
Nc6 {and the b4 pawn falls.}) (12... Rb8 {has also been played.}) 13. a5 g6 14.
Bb3 (14. d4 bxc3 15. bxc3 exd4 16. cxd4 Bg7 {is what Black is looking forward
to.}) 14... Be6 15. Ba4 Bd7 16. Nf1 {Caruana isn't interested in going d4
immediately. Instead tries to strengthen his position with Ne3.} h6 17. Ng3 {
At first sight this move looks pretty illogical as the knight on g3 is sort of
dominated by the pawn on g6. However, White's idea now would surely be to
break in the centre with d4.} (17. Ne3 {With ideas of going to d5 and c4 looks
natural.}) 17... bxc3 18. bxc3 Bg7 19. h3 {Caruana is taking it slow. He wants
to maintain maximum pressure in the position before committing to anything.} (
19. d4 {was of course possible.}) 19... d5 $6 {Peter loses his patience and
breaks in the centre but this is exactly what Caruana was looking for. This
completely justifies the placement of the knight on g3 as it gets to the e4
square.} 20. exd5 Nxd5 21. Ne4 $1 Nb8 (21... f5 22. Qb3 Nce7 23. Nc5 $16) 22.
Bb3 (22. Qb3 {was also possible.}) 22... Be6 23. Bd2 ({A very weird but quite
strong move was} 23. Nc5 $5 {sacrificing the c3 pawn.} Nxc3 24. Nxe6 Rxe6 25.
Qc2 Nd5 26. d4 $1 exd4 27. Rxe6 fxe6 28. Qxg6 $18) 23... Nd7 {Black has
limited the damage to some extent by controlling the c5 square.} 24. Ba4 $6 (
24. Qc2 {with the idea of d3-d4 was better way to proceed.} f5 $6 25. Qa2 $14)
24... f5 $1 25. Ng3 c5 {Black is already doing completely fine.} 26. Bb3 (26.

Qa4 Qd5 $1 {With a serious of accurate moves Black has wrested over the
initiative.} 34. Rad1 Rae8 $2 {A bad mistake by Svidler which changes the
evaluation of the situation from better for him to better for his opponent.} (

the nick of time. Or else he would have had to resign!} Rxe8 39. Rxe8+ Kf7 40.

Bb4 Re5 45. Rc8 Re6 46. Rc7+ Kg8 47. Rxc4 $16 {Caruana is a pawn up but as the
game shows, the conversion into a win is not at all easy.} h5 48. Kg2 Kf7 49.

easiest way to draw} 103. Rb2 Rd8+ 104. Kc4 Rc8 $11) 103. Kc4 $1 {It is the
Philidor position and everything is in place. But can White win in 116 moves?}
Rh4+ 104. Bd4 Rh5 {The enemy rook is already on the first rank so it is time
to take rook from one side to the other.} 105. Bf2 {This is incorrect. The
right way to remember it is the bishop should be defended by the rook. So you
should play Bf2 when your rook is on b2.} (105. Rb2 $1 Rh3 (105... Ka3 106. Re2

square. This is the ideal formation.} Rf3 {Once the rook has been forced to an
inferior square on the third rank it is time to improve your bishop with a
tempo.} 107. Bc5 Rf4+ 108. Bd4 Rf3 109. Rb4+ $1 {This check is crucial.} Ka3 (
109... Ka5 110. Rb7 {is immediate curtains.}) 110. Rb6 Ka2 111. Rb2+ $1 {
Important intermediate check.} Ka3 112. Re2 {Threatening Bc5+. Keep an eye on
the move counter - it is still not 116 moves!} Ka4 113. Be3 $1 {Blocking the
rook.} Ka3 114. Bc5+ Ka4 115. Ra2+ Ra3 116. Rxa3# {And wins on exactly the
50th move! This analysis proves that Caruana not only theoretically had a
winning position, but if he made all the accurate moves then he would have won
the game within the 50 moves rule.}) 105... Rg5 {The rook moves to the better
square.} 106. Rh7 $2 {Crucial wastage of time.} Rg4+ (106... Rb5) 107. Bd4 Rg5

like a Hollywood movie!} 1/2-1/2
