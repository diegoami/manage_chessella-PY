Bc5 {At this point Grischuk realized that he was under some difficulty.} Kf7 (
27... Be7 {is a normal move but it is not so great as after} 28. Bxe7 Kxe7 29.
Qd3 {You cannot offer the queen exchange.} Qd7 30. Qxd7+ Kxd7 31. Kh2 Ke6 32.
Kg3 h6 33. Kh4 c5 34. g4 $1 $18 {is just winning for White, because he could
get his king to h4 via g3.}) 28. Qd2 Bh4 {Grischuk's deep idea was to provoke
g3 and then go Be7 followed by the queen exchange because then Kh2-g3-h4 would
not be possible. But as Grischuk said if you have to go for such ideas then
your position is not so great!} 29. Kh2 (29. g3 Be7 (29... Bxg3 30. Qd8 $18)

At this point the 40 move mark was crossed and both the players got an extra
hour. White is a pawn up and has a completely winning position. Grischuk looked
pretty dejected at this point but he tried his best.} Qd3 42. Qb7+ Ke8 43. Qa8+
Kd7 44. Qb7+ Ke8 45. Qc6+ Kf8 {[#]} 46. Qa8+ $2 (46. Qg6 $1 {was the crucial
move which was overlooked by both the players. The threat is Bg7+ with a mate
and this also covers the g3 square. It is surprising that such an easy move was
missed by both the players and they were not even aware of it after the game
ended!} Bd8 47. Bd6+ Be7 48. Qf6+ $18) 46... Bd8 47. Bc3 Qg3+ 48. Kh1 Qd3 49.
