1. Nf3 {[%emt 0:00:03] Carlsen wants to keep all the flexibilty alive in the
position. He also knows that Grischuk usually replies 1...c5 to 1.Nf3. Hence,
he could play 2.e4 and take it into Sicilian territory without having to worry
about any Berlins.} c5  2. e4 $5 {[%emt 0:00:11] It's Sicilian time.} d6  3.
Bb5+ {[%emt 0:00:03] A typical Carlsen move who would like to have a fluid
position with lots of possibilities without having to worry about too much
theory.} Nd7  4. O-O  a6  5. Bd3 $5 {[%emt 0:00:11] The idea is to later play
c4 or c3 then drop the bishop back to c2 and then go d4.} Ngf6  6. Re1  b5  7.
c4  g5 $5 {[%emt 0: 00:06] Grischuk goes for the same move that was played by
Topalov in the first game of the Sinquefield Cup 2015 against Carlsen. It
seemed like not such a successful choice as Magnus was very well prepared for
this move.} 8. Nxg5  Ne5  9. Be2  bxc4  10. Nc3 $146 {[%emt 0:00:02] Carlsen is
the first one to deviate. In the game against Topalov he went for Na3. Grischuk
went into a long think and was mainly not lookingat the chess board. Clearly he
was trying to remember his analysis.} (10. Na3 Rg8 11. Nxc4 $5 Nxc4 12. d4 {led
to a crazy position in Carlsen-Topalov.}) 10... Rb8 {[%emt 0:16:44] Daniel King
and Nigel Davies mentioned that they were looking at the other rook moving a
square sidewards. When this move was made they were pretty surprised!} 11. Rf1
$5 {[%emt 0:22:01] A very tricky move by Magnus played after 20 minutes of
thought. It frees the e1 square for the g5 knight which could later exchange
itself for the Black knight when it sits on d3. Also the rook on f1 supports
the f-pawn to move forward.} h6  12. Nf3  Nd3  13. Ne1  Nxb2  14. Bxb2  (14.
Qc2 Nd3 15. Nxd3 cxd3 16. Bxd3 Bg7 {followed by 0-0 is nothing much for
White.}) 14... Rxb2  15. Bxc4  Rb4  16. Qe2  Bg7  17. Nc2  Rb6  18. Rab1  O-O 
19. Rxb6  Qxb6  20. Ne3 $14 {[%emt 0:00:06] White has a clear edge in this
position. The material is even and the white pieces are simply much better
placed.} e6  21. f4 {[%emt 0:00:08] All the English players who entered the
commentary room said one and the same thing: "This is an excellent version of
the Grand Prix attack!"} Kh8  22. f5  a5  23. a4  Qd8  24. h3  Qe7  25. Ba6 
Bxa6  26. Qxa6  Nh5  27. Rf3  Rg8  28. Nb5 {[%emt 0:07:45] In some ways going
with the queen to a6 seemed like a dubious decision by Magnus, but this is just
plain bad. The knight block's the queen's path and White has left his king all
alone against the might of four black pieces! From a clearly superior position
it is surprising to see Magnus in grave danger.} Be5 $1 { [%emt 0:00:11]
According to Aronian if White doesn't have Ng4 now then he is just lost. But of
course Magnus had calculated that Ng4 should work.} 29. Ng4  Qh4 $1 30. fxe6
{[#]} fxe6 {Grischuk, who was short on time as usual, immediately recaptured
the pawn. But he had a much stronger continuation.} (30... Rxg4 $1 31. hxg4
Qh2+ (31... Qe1+ 32. Rf1 $18) 32. Kf1 Nf4 $19 {and White's position is just
crumbling to pieces.}) (30... Nf4 $5 { is also interesting when the only way to
survive for White is to find the move} 31. Kf1 $1 fxe6 $11) 31. Nxe5 (31. Nxd6
Bd4+ 32. Ne3 Qe1+ 33. Qf1 Qxd2 $13) 31... dxe5 (31... Qe1+ $1 32. Rf1 (32. Kh2
Ng3 33. Ng4 Ne2 $19) 32... Rxg2+ 33. Kxg2 Qg3+ 34. Kh1 Qxh3+ 35. Kg1 Qg3+ {is a
draw by perpetual.}) 32. Qxe6 Qe1+ $2 (32... Qg5 33. g4 Nf4 $132 {would have
led to a position with mutual chances.}) 33. Rf1 $1 (33. Kh2 Rxg2+ 34. Kxg2
Qe2+ 35. Rf2 Nf4+ 36. Kg3 Qxf2+ 37. Kxf2 Nxe6 38. Nd6 $18 {is also a better
endgame for White.}) 33... Rxg2+ 34. Kxg2 Qxd2+ 35. Kg1 Qe3+  36. Rf2  Qe1+ 
37. Kg2 {[%emt 0:00:14] The checks have come to an end and Grischuk has to
resign the game.} 1-0
