showing this variation...} Nc6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bc4 O-O 8. Bb3 d6 9. h3

cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Bc5 $5 {It's amazing how Grischuk constantly comes up with new
ideas. This move has been played many times already, but the strongest player
who tried it was 2200, after which it mostly happened in beginner games. There
were some recent correspondence games, which Grischuk probably used to find it.
He is trying to play the usual Bc4 line that White plays against the
Accelerated Dragon (with reversed colors)} 7. O-O (7. Nxe5 {would be something
to consider, but it turns out to be harmless} Nxc3 8. bxc3 (8. Bxc6+ bxc6
{Black has decent compensation in both cases (dxc3 or bxc3)} 9. dxc3 (9. bxc3
Qd5 10. Nf3 Bh3 $44) 9... Qe7 $5 $44) (8. Nxc6 $4 Qf6 $1 {hitting the queen and
mate in f2} 9. dxc3 Qxf2+ 10. Kd2 Qxg2 $19) 8... Nxe5 (8... Bxf2+ $2 {this kind
of move is known to be a mistake, because the king is safely placed, while
White in the meantime has a strong center and the bishop pair} 9. Kxf2 Nxe5 10.
Rf1 $16 {followed by Kg1, and d4-e4}) 9. d4 Bd6 10. dxe5 Bxe5 $11 {and Black is
very happy with the better structure. Soon c6 will be played, and the g2 bishop
will be neutralized}) 7... O-O 8. d3 (8. Nxd5 {was played in correspondence
chess, a couple of years ago} Qxd5 9. Ng5 Qc4 $5 {was the original move played}
(9... Qd8 {is acceptable, but runs into} 10. Nxh7 $5 Re8 {threatening to move
the c5-bishop} (10... Kxh7 $2 11. Qc2+ Kg8 12. Qxc5 $16) 11. Ng5 (11. h4 $5 f6
12. Qc2 $13 {followed by Qg6, the position remains very unclear (and weird!)})
11... Qxg5 12. d4 (12. Bxc6 $5 bxc6 13. d4 Qh5 14. dxc5 Bg4 $44 {should be well
compensated for Black}) 12... Qh5 13. dxc5 Rd8 14. Bd2 Nd4 $36) 10. b3 Qg4 11.
Qc2 {White has to do this, otherwise Black is simply fine} Bxf2+ 12. Rxf2 Qxg5
13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Qxc6 Bh3 15. d3 Qe7 16. Be3 Rfc8 17. Qe4 f6 $13 {again with
original play, that should be balanced: 1/2-1/2 (30) Golubenko,A
(2198)-Zakharov,Y (2229) ICCF 2015}) (8. Nxe5 {runs into the same theme} Nxc3
9. bxc3 (9. Nxc6 $2 Nxd1 10. Nxd8 Bxf2+ 11. Kh1 Bg4 $1 $17) 9... Nxe5 10. d4
Bd6 11. dxe5 Bxe5 $11 {and Black should be happy after c6}) 8... Bb6 9. Na4
{similar to the Accelerated Dragon, White gets the bishop pair (there are many
lines where Black plays Na5). In the other hand, Black obtains very good
central control} Re8 10. Bg5 (10. b3 {would be similar to how Black plays the
Accelerated Dragon (Na5, followed by b6, Bb7). Good news for Black is that
there was no need to lose a tempo with h6 (h3), since the bishop is still on c8
(please read the analysis before the 1st move!), and the bishop also went
directly to g4, without 'stopping' at e6, as it happens in the dragon.} Bg4 11.
Bb2 Qd7 {followed by Rad8, and Black is totally fine} (11... Nd4 $5 12. Nxb6
axb6 13. Nxd4 exd4 14. Re1 c5 15. Qd2 Qd7 $11 {and there is nothing to complain
about in Black's position})) 10... Qd6 11. Nd2 Qg6 $1 { the queen finds and
excellen square here} 12. Ne4 (12. Bxd5 $5 {was possibly better than the game}
Qxg5 13. Rc1 Bh3 (13... Ne7 {more solid} 14. Bg2 c6 { threatening Bc7 at some
point} 15. Nxb6 axb6 16. a4 {to stop b5} Nd5 17. Nc4 Qd8 $11 {with balanced
play}) 14. Re1 Rad8 (14... Ba5 $5) 15. Bxc6 bxc6 { with interesting play})
12... Bg4 $1 (12... f5 {there is no need to play this} 13. Nec5 Qxg5 14. Bxd5+
Kh8 15. Rc1 $13 {I like Grischuk's decision better, to bring Be6 and Rad8
quickly (he played Bg4 first to provoke h3)}) (12... Be6 $5 {also perfectly
fine, but Bg4 should be an improved version, h3 may be a weakness in some
variations}) 13. h3 Be6 14. Bd2 Rad8 $15 {now Black is already to be preferred
- everything is harmonious, f5 is coming and he has Bc8 whenever a knight
arrives on c5} 15. Kh2 Kh8 16. a3 f5 $1 17. Nec5 Bc8 { all of Grischuk's forces
are heading towards the center - e4 is unstoppable, unless White himself plays
it, which was a way that Eljanov could try and complicate matters.} 18. b4 (18.
e4 Nf6 $1 (18... fxe4 {is the solid way to deal with this} 19. Bxe4 Qf7 $15
{and moves like Nd4 are coming, Black is doing fine}) 19. exf5 Bxf5 $1 (19...
Qxf5 $5 $15) 20. Nxb7 (20. Nxb6 axb6 21. Nxb7 Rd5 $3 {defending the c6 knight
very creatively} 22. Bxd5 Nxd5 {Black wants to pick up the knight with Bc8} 23.
Qf3 {forced} Nd4 $3 24. Qxd5 Qh5 25. h4 Be6 $1 26. Qg2 Nf3+ 27. Kh1 Nxd2 28.
Rfe1 Nf3 29. Re3 Bd5 $19) 20... Rxd3 21. Nxb6 Bxh3 $3 {an amazing move,
instantly spotted by the computer. The idea is to distract the bishop and
maintain a strong initiative, with two pawns for the piece. I think it is
almost impossible for a human to find all these moves, specially considering
White remains with the pure bishop pair} 22. Bxh3 axb6 $17 {threatening Nd4}
23. Rc1 Nd4 24. Rc3 Nf3+ 25. Qxf3 Rxf3 26. Rxf3 Qh5 27. Kg2 Qf7 $1 $19
{followed by Qd5}) 18... e4 $1 19. e3 $2 (19. dxe4 $1 fxe4 20. Qb1 (20. Qc2 {a
very ugly move to make (allowing Nd4), but that is the computer's suggestion}
Nd4 (20... Qh5 $5 21. Nxb6 Nd4 $36 {looks ugly for White }) 21. Qc4 e3 22. Bc1
$13 {and miraculously White is ok, according to the computer}) 20... Nd4 21.
Bxe4 $2 (21. Nxe4 Bf5 $17) 21... Qh5 $19) 19... Bxc5 $1 {Eljanov's position
simply collapses now, b6 and Ba6 are coming} (19... exd3 $2 20. Nxb6 axb6 21.
Nxd3 $14 {and White is even slightly better}) 20. Nxc5 b6 21. Nb3 Ba6 $19 22.
Nc1 Ne5 {now it's all over, Black starts picking up material and has a dominant
position} 23. Qa4 Bxd3 24. Nxd3 Nxd3 25. b5 (25. Qxa7 $2 Ra8 26. Qb7 Qe6 27. b5
Ne5 $1 $19 {and White should resign}) 25... h5 26. Qc2 Qd6 (26... h4 $1 27.
gxh4 Qf6 {with a devastating attack, but Grischuk wanted to keep it simple})
27. h4 Qe5 28. Kg1 Re6 29. a4 Kh7 30. Ra3 Rdd6 31. a5 c5 {starting serious
action on the queen-side, where Black keeps all the advantages as well} 32.
bxc6 Rxc6 33. Qd1 Nf6 $1 {a good moment to remove the knight, not only to
defend h5, but also because Bc3 is not possible anymore} 34. axb6 axb6 35. Qb1
Red6 {the problem is that White can never activate his bishops, not to mention
the material disadvantage} 36. Rb3 Ng4 37. Bb4 Rd5 38. Be1 Rc1 {And White
resigned. A very convincing game from Alexander Grischuk, who joins Radjabov in
the lead with 3.5/5! On the 12th of July, they both have White - against
Aronian and Harikrishna, respectively. A lot of action yet to come in the final
four rounds, stay tuned!} 0-1
