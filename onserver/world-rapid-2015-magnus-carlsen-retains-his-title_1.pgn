{Vasily Ivanchuk shows in this game how to play with the black pieces against
the Colle Zukertort system.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 b6 4. Bd3 Bb7 5. O-O Be7
6. c4 O-O 7. Nc3 d5 8. cxd5 exd5 9. b3 Nbd7 {This is the basic development
setup for Black. The knight on f6 and bishop on b7 stand in such fashion that
they control the e4 square. And now the rook comes to e8 and the other knight
to f8.} 10. Bb2 a6 11. Ne5 Re8 12. f4 c5 13. Rf3 cxd4 $1 {Taking this pawn
ensures that White can never open up his bishop on b2 with dxc5.} 14. exd4 b5
15. Rh3 Nf8 $1 {This knight on f8 defends the h7 point and the other knight is
ready to jump into e4.} 16. Ne2 Ne4 17. Ng3 f6 18. Ng4 Qd7 {Black has excellent
co-ordination and White's opening has not been successful at all.} 19. Nh5 Ng6
20. Bxe4 dxe4 21. Ne3 Bd6 22. Qf1 Rac8 23. Rd1 Rf8 24. Qf2 Rf7 25. f5 Ne7 26.
Rf1 Nd5 27. Nxd5 Bxd5 {Black has the bishop pair and the bishop on b2 is very
passive.} 28. Bc1 e3 $6 (28... Bf8 29. Be3 Rc3 $15) 29. Bxe3 (29. Rxe3 {was
better.}) 29... Be4 30. Qh4 (30. Ng3 Rc2 $17) 30... Bxf5 31. Rhf3 Bd3 32. Rc1
Rxc1+ 33. Bxc1 Qc6 34. Bf4 Be2 35. Rf2 Bxh5 36. Qxh5 Re7 (36... Bxf4 37. Rxf4
Qc1+ 38. Rf1 Qe3+ 39. Kh1 Qxd4 $17 {was an option.}) 37. Bxd6 Qxd6 { Black has
a nagging edge. The d4 pawn is weak and the White king will be in trouble.} 38.
Qd1 Re4 39. Rd2 Qe6 40. Qf3 Re3 {White queen cannot leave the control of the e3
square as Re1 followed by Qe3 would be mate.} 41. Qf4 g5 42. d5 (42. Qb8+ Kg7
43. Qc7+ Kg6 44. h4 {was better but White should be losing here too.}) 42...
Qe8 $1 43. Qd4 Re1+ 44. Kf2 Re4 $1 {The Ukrainian was very quick to execute
this idea. Rf4 is simply a deadly check.} 45. Qc3 Rf4+ 46. Kg3 Qe1+ {A great
game by Ivanchuk who never really gave a chance to his opponent.} 0-1
