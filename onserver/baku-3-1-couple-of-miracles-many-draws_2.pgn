Qd5 Qc2 {Black's counterplay is still annoying.} 33. Rd2 Qc3 34. Ra2 Qe1+ 35.
Kg2 f4 36. a6 $5 {Very brave, computer approved.} (36. Rc2 {is the computer
recommendationg, I assume trying to mate Black with Rc8. It would never have
occured to me.}) 36... f3+ 37. Kh3 Rg6 $4 {with... what threat, exactly?} (
37... e3 $1 38. a7 exf2 $13) 38. Kh4 $4 (38. a7 $1 Qf1+ 39. Kh4 Qg2 40. h3 {
and White is perfectly safe! The pawn queens and Black gets mated.}) 38... Qb4
$2 (38... e3 $1) 39. Kh3 (39. Qf5 $1) 39... Rg5 $1 {Suddenly the tables turn
and the attack is decisive.} 40. Qf7 Qc5 {Time control, but White's king is too
weak now.} 41. g4 Qc1 42. a7 h5 43. Qxh5+ {The only hope.} Rxh5+ 44. gxh5 Qc8+
45. Kg3 Qa8 46. Ra6 Kg8 47. b4 Kf8 48. Kf4 Ke7 {The endgame isn't trivial just
yet, it seems impossible to remove the queen from a8} 49. Ke3 (49. h6 $1 gxh6
50. Rxh6 e3 $1 {what else?} 51. Rh7+ Kf6 52. Kxe3 {is still not entirely clear
to me.}) 49... Kd7 50. Kd4 Kc7 51. Ke3 Kb7 52. Ra5 Kb6 53. Ra3 Kc6 54. Ra5 Kd6
55. Kd4 $2 (55. Kf4 {still would have forced Black to work somewhat, but after
Kd5 and c4 it seems like a winning position.}) 55... Qd5+ 56. Ke3 Ke5 $1 {White
ultimately gets mated!} 0-1
