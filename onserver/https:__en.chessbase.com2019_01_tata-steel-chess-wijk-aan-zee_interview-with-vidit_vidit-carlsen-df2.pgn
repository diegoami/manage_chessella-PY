'ICC Gambit' line of ...cxd4 and only then ...Nc6, although the latter is
fully playable. Carlsen has lost a game on the Black side of this, albeit
after playing some rather strange moves. 1-0 (55) Mamedyarov,S-Carlsen,M Biel

getting a +1 advantage with either side is quite strong.} )Na6 (11... Nxc4 12. Rc1 {now virtually obliges} Nc6 {in order to keep attacking b2 but
defend against the threat of Nd5. However Black could be slightly worse after} 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. Na4 $14 {and certainly Carlsen wouldn't enjoy the static
disadvantage here.} )12. Rc1 {Safest. White's play gives the impression that
he's content with a draw, and to be honest, most players under 2750 would
agree with him.} (12. Nd5 Kf8 {covers all bases and Black can continue with ...
Bf5 next, completing development.} )(12. Bxd6 exd6 (12... Bxc3+ $5 13. bxc3 Rxd6 $13 {could well be a position the engine doesn't get. I wouldn't be

untangling moves.} )13. Nd5 Bd7 14. 0-0 Rab8 $11 )Bf5 13. 0-0 (13. Na4 {
sensibly keeps the a6-knight in place for now, but with so many pieces on the

like to take on c6, exchange a pair of rooks, and then play b4 deep into some
