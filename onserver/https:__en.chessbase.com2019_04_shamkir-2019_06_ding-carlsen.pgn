Black breaks the symmetry earlier than Grischuk did, only to restore it again.
In this game, we are reminded that liquidation to a draw is by no means the
only way that symmetrical positions can go.} (7... Ne4 8. Nc3 Nxc3 9. bxc3 O-O

either queen's bishop) was reached, as above. This version seems, if anything,
less ambitious because Black doesn't even have to defend c6.} 13. Qa4 e6 14.

on f4!} g5 $1 {There are some advantages to having your queen at home...}) ({

to install this bishop on c4 first, and if White wanted to exchange it then
the a-pawns would also come off.} 19... Bd3) 20. a4 Bg4 21. Qe1 Be2 22. Bf1

the world champion would have had to defend a bad rook ending a pawn down.
There is simply no way to deal with the threat of Ra5, and even if there were,
White could also just bring his king to d3 and hint at playing f4. As it's not
a garden-variety '4v3', I'm not sure Black's holding chances are good at all.
Probably White only considered 28.Rc7, after which Black has ...d4 to 
(probably) hold.}) 27... Bxf4 28. gxf4 (28. exf4 {is slightly more problematic
