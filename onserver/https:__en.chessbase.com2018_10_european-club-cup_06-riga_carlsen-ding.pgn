the c5-square:} 19. Na4 c5 $1 {- note Ding's 18th move.}) 19... Rh4 $1 {
Ding Liren is on the roll. He can play anything against anyone, and he will
never lose. In this situation the daring rook move is fully justified.} (19...

cutting off that rook's retreat is attractive, but one has take into account
those nasty little things called tactics. I'm not sure how deeply Magnus had
looked into it.} d4 {Interesting, but hardly necessary.} (23... Rxh3 24. Rxh3
