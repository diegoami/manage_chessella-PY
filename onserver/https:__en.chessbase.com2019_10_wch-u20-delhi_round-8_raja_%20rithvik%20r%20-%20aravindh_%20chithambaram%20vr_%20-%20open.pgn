{A very instructive game gave us the current Indian national campion in all
format! Dynamic play facing the Catalan opening against his Indian compatriot.

moving away from the white diagonal, and defending c7-a6.}) 8. Nfd2 e5 {
It gives to white the possibility of damaging the black pawn structure, but in
return the double bishops, and a lot of activity is there as compensation.} 9.

risky move with the king in the center, but Aravindh handled the position very
well and was very dynamic, it was necessary! if for example he plays more
passive:} (13... O-O $6 14. Nf3 Re8 15. b3 $16 {Now white has an excellent
position, active pieces that will prepare to play against the black structure.}

it is not the most accurate but it is not easy for white to discover the best
continuation, for example the natural capture en f6:} ({This position had
