{[Needless to say, this was popularised by one evil dude Parimarjan Negi, who
was writing books on how to win with white pieces against all existing
openings which the whole world follows!]} Qc7 9. O-O-O Be7 10. g4 b5 {[This
can come from different move orders, but a pivotal position for this variation]
} 11. a3 Bb7 12. Bh4 h6 13. g5 {[A new move in this position. In a way, we can
call this an example of modern opening preparation - watch how the game
unfolds]} hxg5 14. Bxg5 {[Now, 13.g5 was not a completely correct move, but to
exploit it, black had to respond with way too much creativity here]} Rc8 {
[And black doesn't find it, though he too has an evil idea here]} ({Believe it
or not, black's best line of play is a completely 'computerised' one here:} 
14... b4 $5 15. axb4 a5 $5 16. bxa5 (16. b5 $2 a4 $1 {with the idea of 17...
a3! It is difficult to defend white's position here:} 17. Qc4 Qb6 18. Nc6 a3 {
[It is next to impossible to annotate this position in depth in a news article
- suffice to say that the complications are in black's favour]} 19. b3 a2 20.
Kb2 Ng4 $1 {and black wins, the simplest variation being} 21. Bxe7 $2 Ne3)
16... Qxa5 17. Nb3 Qb6 {and the open kingside gives better prospects for black
in the long run. But I wouldn't be surprised if Xiong had prepared it all
before: after all, it is not easy to play like this over the board, and white
could have found a way to hold on to things dear in his preparations before
the game}) 15. h4 $1 {[White's idea behind this move is really cute]} ({
A routine white move would have shown black's hand:} 15. Bg2 Qb6 16. Kb1 Rxc3
$1 {The point behind 14...Rc8. Now you must be able to see the idea behind
WHITE's 15th move!?}) 15... Qa5 $6 ({Black should have ignored his earlier
threat and continued with} 15... Nc5) 16. Rh3 {[That's it. White kind of stops
black's play on the queenside, and enjoys a certain 'advantage of a defender'
here. Black finds it difficult to do much]} Rxc3 {[Desparation?]} 17. Rxc3 Nxe4

position where Xiong excels. Try to see what Xiong saw here]} 23. Bxe6 $3 fxe6

variation. On the other hand, white must have seen the whole variation for it
to work to the end]} Nxe4 {[#]} 26. f5 $1 {[Cool! a simple pawn push at the
end of a series of sacrifices is always a tactical delight!]} Rxh4 27. fxe6 Qc7
