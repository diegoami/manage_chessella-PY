Nf6 {(00:01) And here we have Kramnik with his legendary, nowadays infamous,
"Berlin Defence". Chess fans remember how Kramnik played this in every single
game in this opening against Kasparov's 1.e4 in the 2000 match. Ever since,
Berlin's popularity has increased among serious players. There is a lot to
talk about in the Berlin Defence, from its reputation among GMs to the boredom
it causes among fans, when they yawn "just another dull draw" as soon as it
appears on the board. Nevertheless, let us focus on Kramnik for now!} 4. Bxc6 {

6. h3 {(02:51)} Be6 {(03:02)} 7. Nc3 {(02:43)} Qe7 {(03:40) After some thought,
Kramnik decides to castle queenside. He keeps his options open in case he gets
a chance to play for a win.} 8. Qe2 {(07:03)} O-O-O {(02:09)} 9. Bd2 {(01:37)}
h6 $5 {(04:29) A multi-purpose move: it prevents any Ng5 while sending a
signal to the opponent that he is ready to face short castling with g5.} 10.

(04:00)} 12. g4 {(06:16)} Bc8 $5 {(04:21) It is funny that this move is not
among the engines' favorite moves. Nevertheless, it has a very deep concept
which experts and club players can learn a lot from. Kramnik takes his time to
regroup his minor pieces to launch an attack on the queenside. For this
purpose, he begins by taking away his light-squared bishop from the way of
other minor pieces.} 13. Rdg1 {(#) (02:22)} {[%tqu "En","Black now has a

black squares in this position. Unfortunately for White, he had given up on
his light-squared bishop as early as move four!}) 18... Bc5 $1 {(01:25)
Kramnik comes up with an interesting and ambitious set-up. The way he
gradually improves his position is a crash-course on "how to put one's pieces
on the right squares".} 19. h5 $6 {(04:20) this move hinders White's
development on the kingside and gives Kramnik enough time to gradually gain
ground in the center and queenside.} Qf7 {(07:26)} 20. Rg3 {(06:41)} b5 $5 {
(03:20)} 21. Ng1 {(01:52)} Bb6 {(04:41) Now we see what Kramnik's idea is: he
is preparing to play c5-c4.} 22. Ne2 {(01:48)} c5 {(01:05)} 23. Rf1 {(05:37)}
Bb7 {(03:31) The two mighty bishops are eyeing White's center and Black is
ready to open up "everything".} 24. Nc1 {(05:39)} Rd7 $1 {(05:06) Now it is
time to prepare the rooks:} 25. Nh4 {(08:56)} Red8 {(01:58)} 26. Be3 {(03:10)}

time deciding whether he needs to open up the game or not!} 27. Bxb6 {(01:53)}

structure is shattered.} Rd4 {(04:11)} 31. f4 {(02:14)} exf4 {(09:48)} 32. Nxf4
{(00:06) White lost a lot of time playing f4, which only exposes his weakened
pawn-structure to further damage!} b4 {(00:38)} 33. Re3 {(03:19)} Qd7 {(02:03)}
34. Qf3 {(00:54)} Qa4 {(01:47) Now, it is time for a mate attack.} 35. Nfe2 $4
{(03:33) A final blunder but White was already strategically lost.} Rxd3 $1 {
(01:57) This did not take much effort from Kramnik.} 36. Nxd3 {(01:41)} Rxd3 {
(00:09)} 37. Ng3 {(00:11)} (37. Rxd3 $4 Bxe4) 37... Ba6 $1 {(01:04) Since, e4
is protected, the bishop needs a new diagonal to enter the 'show'.} 38. b3 {
