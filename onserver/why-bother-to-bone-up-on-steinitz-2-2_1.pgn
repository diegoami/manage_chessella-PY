{A novelty, still sometimes seen in similar positions today: White seeks to
ensure that he can retain his potentially useful attacking, light square
bishop. Black's simplest reply might actually be the equally surprising 8...a6,
followed by ...b5, reaching fairly standard ground on the queenside. Game 14
saw Chigorin try 8...d5!?, but after 9.Qe2 Qd6 10.Bc2 b6!? 11.Ng3 Ba6 12.0-0
dxe4 13.Nxe4 Nxe4 14.Qxe4, White enjoyed central light square and kingside
pressure (eventually winning). Steinitz-Lasker, 1894 world championship (Game
2), continued 8...Bd7 9.Ne3 Ne7 10.Bb3, and White again won after a hugely
complex battle.} Nd7 9. Ne3 Nc5 10. Bc2 Ne6 11. h4 $1 {[#] An alert thrust that
throws some doubt on the Black knight manoeuvre from f6-d7-c5-e6. This is,
however, no 'old' style attacking move, rather an attempt to exploit a
momentary opportunity to get in h4-h5 and open the h-file.} Ne7 12. h5 d5 13.
hxg6 fxg6 $6 ({Perhaps trusting to his coming, optically healthy-seeming piece
development, Chigorin may have underestimated the danger in now allowing White
to isolate his e-pawn and weaken Black's central light squares. But White is
also better after} 13... hxg6 14. Ng4 {, attacking e5 and playing to gain the
bishop pair (by eventually playing Nh6+), or perhaps after the even more
ambitious} (14. Qe2 {, followed by Bd2 and 0-0-0})) 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. Nxd5 Qxd5
16. Bb3 Qc6 17. Qe2 Bd7 18. Be3 Kh8 19. O-O-O Rae8 20. Qf1 $1 {[#] This modest
retreat underlines Black's strategic difficulties. It was extremely rare in the
19th century to see such a build-up of attacking force by pieces, as here,
restricted solely to the attacker's first three ranks. We now understand the
power that can be unleashed in such Hedgehog-like set-ups. White threatens d4,
forcing open the centre and battling for control of both the light and dark
square diagonals directly aimed at Black's king. Meanwhile, there remains that
path to Black's king on the half-open h-file.} a5 21. d4 exd4 22. Nxd4 Bxd4
({Black treads on egg-shells. Not} 22... Nxd4 $2 {, which loses at once to} 23.
Rxh7+ $1 Kxh7 24. Qh1+) 23. Rxd4 Nxd4 $6 {I suspect (but can't corroborate),
that Chigorin deliberately permitted Steinitz to cap his extraordinary attack
with its justly famous finish. Chigorin apparently thought that Black must in
any case lose after} (23... Re7 24. Rdh4 Rff7 25. g3 $1 {, threatening 26.Bd4+
Kg8 27.Qd3, attacking g6. He was almost certainly correct. But he might still
soldier on, by playing} Kg8 {, and if} 26. Qd3 Qb5 {, though the engines scream
that White wins at least a pawn (if nothing else) after} 27. Qxb5 Bxb5 28. Re1
