1. d4 {This game has a great lesson for all of us. Do not go for material if
your opponent is in a romantic mood! In a match between two young and strong
GMs it was the Spaniard who rolled over his Ukrainian colleague.} Nf6 2. c4 b6
3. f3 Bb7 4. e4 e6 5. Nc3 Bb4 {This is already a risky line. White has scored
more than 65% in it.} 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Nge2 d5 8. cxd5 exd5 9. e5 Nfd7 10. a3 Be7
11. Qc2 $146 {A novelty in a position where White has 3.5/4!} h6 12. Nf4 $6
(12. O-O c5 13. f4 {would have been the way I would have tried to handle this
game. It seems that Anton Guijaro only wants blood!}) 12... Bg5 13. O-O c5 14.
Nfe2 $6 {Change of plan or change of heart?!} cxd4 15. f4 $5 { Change of plan!
Not heart!} dxc3 16. fxg5 cxb2 17. Bxb2 {The position is extremely volatile.
White has two strong bishops and a huge lead in development. Pawns really don't
count when the smell of checkmate is in the air!} Qxg5 18. Nf4 (18. e6 fxe6 19.
Qc7 {looks very dangerous} Ba6 20. Rxf8+ Nxf8 21. Bxa6 Nxa6 22. Qb7 Rd8 23.
Qxa6 e5 24. Rf1 Ne6 {with a very unbalanced position where White should have
the upper hand.}) (18. Rf3 Rc8 19. Qd1 Nxe5 20. Rg3 Qh5 21. Qf1 Nbd7 {looks
also very dangerous but I cannot see any concrete path for White while one
should start counting pawns: Black is up three of them!}) 18... Qe7 $4 { hard
to understand. Black could not really go back after spending so much time
taking the material. Black should have taken on e5! When you do not see
anything don't be afraid of ghosts!} (18... Nxe5 19. h4 Qe7 20. Rae1 Nbc6 { and
I do not see anything concrete for White. Black should be fine or even winning
here.}) 19. Bh7+ Kh8 20. e6 $1 {Now White is all over Black!} Rc8 21. Qf5 Nf6
22. exf7 Qxf7 23. Bxf6 gxf6 (23... Qxf6 24. Ng6+ Kxh7 25. Nf8+ Kg8 26. Qh7+
Kxf8 27. Rxf6+ gxf6 28. Re1 {and mate is inevitable}) 24. Ng6+ {The rest is
simple.} Kg7 25. Ne5 {just too many pieces.} Qe8 26. Rae1 Nc6 27. Qxf6+ Kxh7
28. Nxc6 Rxc6 29. Re7+ {White's 'Blitzkrieg' paid off and Black is lost due to
colossal material loss.} 1-0
