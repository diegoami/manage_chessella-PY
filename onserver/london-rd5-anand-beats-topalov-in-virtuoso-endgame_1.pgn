1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 c5 3. Nf3 e6 4. e3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. d4 cxd4 7. exd4 Nxc3 8.
bxc3 Qc7 9. Bd2 Nd7 10. Bd3 b6 11. Ng5 $5 {A typical creative Aronian move
clearing the d1-h5 diagonal for the white queen.} Nf6 (11... Bb7 12. Qh5 g6 13.
Qh3 $36) 12. Qf3 Rb8 13. O-O Bd6 14. Qh3 h6 15. Rfe1 $6 {Aronian after the game
said that he completely missed that his opponent could just take on h2. Carlsen
saw this during the game but refrained from it as he didn't like Black's
position.} (15. f4 $5 Bb7 16. Rae1 {was what Levon thought he should play.})
15... O-O (15... Bxh2+ 16. Qxh2 Qxh2+ 17. Kxh2 hxg5+ 18. Kg1 g4 19. a4 $44
{White has good compensation.}) 16. Nf3 Bf4 17. Bxf4 Qxf4 18. Ne5 {Aronian felt
that the knight on e5 would dominate the board. However Black is just fine.}
Bb7 19. Rad1 Qg5 20. c4 Rbd8 21. Qg3 Qxg3 22. hxg3 {Aronian realised that he
was slightly worse but according to him White's plan is quite simple: play f3
and get the king to the center.} Rfe8 $6 {Carlsen said in the press conference
that this was simply bullshit! He wanted to play Re7-c7 but later realised that
the idea wasn't any good.} 23. f3 Nd7 (23... Re7 24. Bc2 Rc7 25. Bb3 {and later
the threats of d4-d5 become quite irritating.}) 24. Kf2 Kf8 25. Bc2 Nxe5 26.
Rxe5 Re7 27. Bb3 Red7 28. Ke3 g6 {The rook on e5 is not going to be trapped.}
29. g4 Bc6 30. d5 exd5 31. cxd5 Bb7 32. f4 f6 33. Re6 Bxd5 34. Rxd5 Rxd5 35.
Bxd5 Rxd5 36. Rxf6+ {Things have liquidated and now it's just a draw.} Kg7 37.
Rc6 Ra5 38. Rc2 Kf6 39. Rc6+ Kg7 40. Rc2 Kf6 {A game that showed some promise
at the start but didn't live up to the expectations.} 1/2-1/2
