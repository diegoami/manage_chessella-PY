1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. f3 e6 4. e4 c5 5. d5 d6 6. Ne2 Bg7 7. Nec3 {The game has
transposed to a Benoni with one important difference. The Knight on g1 has
appeared on c3 instead of the normal knight on b1. Often with the pawn on f3
the kingside knight proves to be a problem child for White and often the
knight on b1 can end up on a3 or c4 later on. The problem is that with all
these pawn moves and moving the knight twice Nakamura is behind in development.
If given time white will have a nice spatial advantage.} a6 8. a4 Nh5 9. Be3
exd5 10. cxd5 {Now the pawn structure looks more like a Benoni a and the
knight on b1 has a clear path to c4. The young Dutch player knows he cannot
play slowly and opens up the center.} f5 11. exf5 gxf5 12. Qd2 O-O 13. Be2 Nd7
14. O-O f4 15. Bf2 Qg5 16. g4 {The obvious move was 16.Ne4 followed by N(1)-c3
after Black has weakened the e4 square but Nakamura wanted to stop all the Bh3
ideas and force Black's pieces back a little.} (16. Ne4 Qg6 17. Nbc3 Ne5 18.
Kh1 Bf5 {with a balanced position}) 16... Ne5 17. Kh1 Nf6 18. Rg1 Qg6 19. Bh4
h5 {White is still a little behind development and has a weak king. Nakamura
has to be very careful. Positionally White is still fine but it means little
if your king gets mated!} 20. g5 {[%tqu "En","You are black versus Hikaru
Nakamura and your kngiht is attacked, do you retreat? Can you find better!","",
"","f6g4","",10]} Nfg4 $1 21. Ne4 (21. fxg4 $2 hxg4 {Black would have an
obvious attack if White chose to take.}) 21... Bf5 22. Nf6+ $2 (22. Nbc3 {
The natural move would still hold everything together although 22...Ne3 does
look dangerous.} Ne3 23. Nf6+ Kh8 24. Rae1) {[%tqu "En","Many choices for
Black here, even though he is in check, but only one is a good move! Find it!",

Bxf6 $4 (24. h3) 24... Nf2#) 23. gxf6 Bxf6 {The game has turned since all the
black pieces are in attacking mode and White's queenside knight and rook are
still on their starting squares!} 24. Nc3 {Hikaru goes for the practical
choice even though it is, according to the silicon monster, not the best move.}
Bxh4 $19 25. Raf1 Bg5 26. h4 Bh6 27. fxg4 hxg4 28. Rxf4 Qh5 {The young Dutch
man plays accurately to the end!} 29. Rg2 Qxh4+ 30. Kg1 Ng6 31. Rxf5 Bxd2 32.
