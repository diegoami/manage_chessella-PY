activity to compensate for the e6 weakness.} 18. Rxe6 Nh4 $44) 18. Qd3 Ne7 19.

will double down the e-file.} Bb8 20. Bb4 Bd6 21. Bxd6 (21. Qa3 $5) 21... Qxd6

attack which is not often seen in e4-e5 openings. Black will be left with a few
weaknesses on the queenside when the smoke clears.} axb5 27. axb5 cxb5 28. Qxb5

probability lose all his pawns.} 1/2-1/2
