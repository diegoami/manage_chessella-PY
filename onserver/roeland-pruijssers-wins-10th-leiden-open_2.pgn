We join the action after forty moves. Both the players received an extra half
an hour and had decent amount of time to think about the position on the board.
} {[%tqu "Who do you think is better and why? It is clear that White has the
upper hand for the simple reason that the dark squares around the black king
are extremely weak and Black doesn't have a dark squared bishop. On the other
hand Black has the e5 square, which is an outpost for his knight. It is
difficult to handle the position but as we shall see Roeland does the job
excellently.","","",Nf3,"",10]} 41. Nf3 Re8 42. Nxe5 Nxe5 43. Qf4 {A deadly
