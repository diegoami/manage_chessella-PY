{The youngest GM "papa" in the world ( Is it so?), Anish Giri, had a smooth
and good tournament. In spite of a "hiccup" against Aronian, Giri proved that
becoming a father suits him fine! In this game he had a great chance to tie
for first with Nepomniachtchi but chess proved not to be a fairy tale this
time.} 1. d4 {(172s)} Nf6 {(0s)} 2. c4 {(6s)} e6 {(1s)} 3. Nc3 {(35s)} Bb4 {

oldest living one, Boris Spassky.} c5 {(66s)} (5... d5 {transposes to the
Ragozin.}) 6. Rc1 {(265s)} (6. d5 {is more critical but deep analyses in
recent games don't show much for White in a position where White sacrifices a
pawn to seize the initiative thanks to his pair of bishops.} exd5 7. cxd5 d6 8.
