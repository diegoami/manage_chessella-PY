O-O e4 7. Ng5 Bxc3 8. bxc3 Re8 9. f3 e3 10. d3 (10. dxe3 d6 $44 {[%csl
Rc3,Rc4]}) 10... d5 11. Qa4 $146 {Peter thought for a while before making
this move. Was it not home prepared? Well, he thought for a while but
not long enough to make it an over the board novelty. He might have been
recollecting his analysis.} (11. Qb3 { has been the main move in the past.}
Na5 12. Qa3 c6 13. cxd5 cxd5 14. f4 { leads to interesting positions.})
11... h6 {Karjakin made this move quickly, which meant that he was prepared
for Peter's novelty!} 12. cxd5 Nxd5 13. Ne4 f5 14. Nc5 f4 {This was all
preparation.} (14... Nxc3 15. Qb3+ Nd5 16. f4 Nce7 17. Nxb7 Bxb7 18. Qxb7
$16) 15. Bb2 Rb8 16. c4 {This was the first position where Karjakin sank
into thought. He was happy because he had not studied this move and felt
that it must be a sub-standard reply.} Nde7 (16... Nf6) 17. g4 { Peter
knew that in effect he was burying his bishop on g2 with this move. But
he was so afraid of the attack on his king that he decided to close the
kingside.} (17. d4 fxg3 18. hxg3 (18. d5 gxh2+) 18... Nf5 19. d5 Nxg3

21... Qxg5 $19 { and it's game over.}) 20. Rfd1 Nd4 21. Bxd4 Qxd4 22.
Qxa7 Qd7 23. Qa3 h4 24. Qc3 Bf5 25. h3 {[%csl Rg2]} Bxh3 $6 {A very simple
question to ask is: what was the need of taking the pawn on h3. The bishop
is just dead, so why give it an opportunity to wake up. Karjakin thought
that Bxh3 by White is not possible right now. And if he can just retreat
the bishop and play h3 then he would be completely winning. But he missed
Peter's next move.} 26. Qe5 $1 (26. Bxh3 Qxh3 $17 {[%cal Ge7f5]}) 26...
Ng6 27. Qd5+ Be6 28. Qxd7 Bxd7 29. Kh2 $1 {And just like that the bishop
on g2 can now hope for a new life on h3! By now the position is quite
complex and can go either way.} Ra8 30. Bh3 Bxh3 31. Kxh3 Ra3 32. Rdc1
Rea8 33. Rc2 Kf7 34. d4 Rd8 35. d5 Ne5 36. Rb1 Kg6 $6 (36... Ra6 { It
was important to prepare for the move d6 here.}) 37. d6 $1 {Svidler is
alert and takes over the initiative.} cxd6 38. Rxb6 Kh5 39. Nxd6 Rda8
40. Rb5 Nc6 41. g6+ $1 Kxg6 42. Rc1 $1 {Transferring the rook to g1.}
Kh7 (42... Nd4 43. Rg1+ Kh7 44. Rb7 Rg8 45. Rg4 Nxe2 46. Nf5 $18) 43.
Rg1 R3a7 44. Rg4 Kg8 45. Rh5 {White is completely better at this point.}
Ne7 46. Rgxh4 Ng6 47. Rg4 Nf8 48. Rxf4 Rxa2 49. Rfh4 (49. Nf5 g6 50. Nh6+
Kh8 51. Re5 Rxe2 52. Ng4 {followed by Nxe3 gives White definite winning
chances.}) 49... g6 50. Re5 {And before things went out of hand Svidler
agreed to a draw. Both players can be happy as well as sad with the result.
Karjakin was winning after the opening and Svidler had a dominating position
towards the end.} 1/2-1/2
