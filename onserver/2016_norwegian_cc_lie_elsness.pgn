20. exf5 {A difficult positon for black which is underlined by the computerÂ´s
suggestion 20...f6. Still it was better than the move played.} Bf6 $2 21. Qh5 (
21. Ne4 $1 {Also looks good.}) 21... Kh7 $2 {From bad to worse. It is not easy
to defned such positions and certainly not against a ferocious attacking
player like GM Kjetil Lie.} 22. Ne4 Qe7 {White wants to bring his bishop into
play via c1 which pretty much will decide the game.} 23. Rxc6 $1 {Beautiful
chess.} bxc6 24. Bc1 Kg8 25. Qxh6 Bg7 26. f6 $1 1-0
