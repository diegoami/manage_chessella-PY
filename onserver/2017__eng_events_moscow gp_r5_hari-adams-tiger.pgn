1. d4 {Already this is a surprise. Harikrishna usually plays 1.e4, but I guess
he was attracted by Adams's rather narrow black repertoire.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 c6 6. e3 h6 {Adams repeats the line that he lost a
game with only three months ago.} ({Perhaps} 6... Be7 7. Bd3 Nbd7 8. Nge2 h6 9.
Bh4 Nh5 {is a better move order, although} 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Qd2 {leads to the
same position that Adams got against Mamedyarov (see below.).}) 7. Bh4 Be7 8.
Bd3 Nbd7 9. f3 $5 {There has only been three games with this move, so far, but
it is very logical. White aims to meet Nh5 with Bf2.} (9. Qc2 {In older theory
White used to play the queen here, in order to take Nf6-e4 out of the picture.
However, if Ne4 is not such a great idea, there are clearly more constructive
moves than Qc2!?} Nh5 $5 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 {Compared to the position after 9.Nge2
Nh5 10.Bxe7 etc, this is clearly less critical. The queen would be better
placed on d2, so that White can continue with f3, preparing e4.}) (9. Nge2 $5 {
was Mamedyarovs choice, in Sharjah. I commented on this game for Chessbase in
February.} {Perhaps Adams was prepared to play the critical} Ne4 $5 (9... Nh5

12. Rxd1 Kxd8 13. f3 {when, to quote myself, "White has a clear plan in e3-e4 
(and possibly g4/h4), whereas Black is somewhat passive. White ought to have a
small advantage."}) ({After} 9. Nf3 {Black doesn't have to worry about the f3/
e4-plan and can focus on finding a way to meet b2-b4-b5.}) 9... O-O (9... Ne4
10. Bxe7 Nxc3 11. Bxd8 Nxd1 12. Rxd1 Kxd8 13. Ne2 $14) 10. Nge2 b5 ({Wesley So

Rxd8 14. Kf2 {, saying that White's play on the kingside, with h4, g4, etc, is
promising. Here h6 turns out to be a weakness even though the queens are off
the board.}) ({The usual plan in these positions is} 10... Re8 11. O-O Nf8 {
and although h6 is not part of the usual narrative, it is not quite clear how
White should prove an advantage.} 12. Kh1 Ne6 13. Bc2 $5 (13. Qc2) (13. a3 $5)

Ottawa 2013}) 11. O-O {I prefer the White side in this structure. Black must ,
sooner or later, play c6-c5 and be left with an isolated pawn in the center.
The alternative is to allow White to play e3-e4 and that looks even worse.
White has no similar reason not to play e3-e4.} Nb6 ({Black should seek
counterplay in a more dynamic manner. Slow building up will only further
White's case. Perhaps} 11... b4 $5 12. Na4 Nb6 13. Nc5 (13. Rc1 Ng4 $1 14. Bxe7

missing pawn.}) 12. Bf2 $1 a5 (12... b4 13. Na4 Nxa4 14. Qxa4 Qb6 15. Rfc1 (15.
a3 $5) 15... Bd7 16. Qc2 Rfc8 17. Qd2 (17. Bf5 $5) 17... a5 {is only a little
better for White.}) (12... Nc4 13. Qc2 Bd7 14. Rad1 Re8 15. Ng3 {and e3-e4 is
hanging in the air.}) 13. Ng3 $1 {Now b5-b4 can be met with Nce2.} (13. Nc1 {
makes the back ranks more crowded, but is also possible.}) 13... b4 14. Nce2 c5

looks like a more direct and possibly better way to exploit Black's weak
points.}) 17... Qb6 18. Re1 {Harikrishna is playing the white side in model
style; not hurrying, while guiding the pieces towards the best squares. This
move makes Nd4 free to move, while opening up a slot for the knight and bishop
on f1.} Re8 19. Bb1 $5 ({Even more active is} 19. Bc2 Nf8 20. Ba4 Bd7 21. Ngf5
{, but after} h5 {, intending g6, it is not clear how White will continue. In
the bigger scheme White would prefer to keep the light squared bishops and
exchange the dark squared ones...}) (19. Ngf5 Ba6 20. g4 $6 Bxd3 21. Qxd3 Ne5
22. Qe2 Bf8 $132) 19... a4 {Black's advanced queenside pawns are a mixed
blessing. On one hand they can create tactical possibilities with b4-b3 or
a4-a3 (aiming for the c3-square), but the downside is that they will become 
(very) weak in the endgame. A similar situation can arise in the Kings Indian,
when Black plays the a- and b-pawns forward.} 20. Qc2 {White wants to provoke
g7-g6, but Black should be happy to be provoked.} (20. b3 $5 a3 21. Qd2 Ba6 22.

Black has plenty of activity, so perhaps it is balanced.}) 20... Ra5 $5 (20...

balanced, but I keep worrying about the b4-pawn.}) 21. Nge2 Nf8 $2 {This is a
part of the old undermine-d4-with-everything-you-have-plan, but at this moment
the most important thing is to keep White from pushing the bishop away from c5
with Nf4-d3. It's a small slip, but it has huge implications.} ({It was better
to play} 21... Ne5 22. Nf4 Bd7 {, when after} 23. Red1 (23. Nd3 Nxd3 24. Qxd3
Raa8 {is quite OK for Black, since the bishop on b1 is out of play.}) 23... g6
24. b3 Rc8 25. Qe2 Re8 {Black has no active plan (that doesn't hurt himself),
but it's quite possible that White has none either.}) 22. Nf4 {[%cal Gf4d3]
Black has no good way to deal with Nf4-d3.} Bd7 23. Nd3 Bd6 24. Bg3 $1 {
With the dark squared bishops gone d4, c5, e5, c7 and not least b4, all become
weak. Now White has a steady advantage.} Bxg3 25. hxg3 Rc8 26. Qd2 Rb8 27. g4

d4 and the c-file. Black has two weaknesses in b4 and d5.} Qd6 (31... Re8 32.
