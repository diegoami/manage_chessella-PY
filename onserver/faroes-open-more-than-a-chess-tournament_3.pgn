interesting and strategically balanced. It looks like Black has a lot of
activity, but if well understood, I think it is White who has a slightly tiny
tiny edge here regardless of what Stockfish says. However, if your opponent is
prepared upto 20-25 moves in all directions(like a lot of 2700's?), it's
probably a draw all the same(but White still has to play decent moves of
course)} g5 $6 {I disliked this move as soon as I played.} (15... Qb6 16. h3

And it turns out that Black is okay, although it's far from trivial to evaluate
this.}) 18. Nh2 (18. Qg6 $5 {is actually quite strong. This was suggested by
Martin Jogvan Joensen, although me and Helgi dismissed it almost immediately.})

was in mortal danger for a large part of the game. It seemed to me that we both
had a lot to understand about this position though.} 1/2-1/2
