understandable because it puts pressure on d4. However, Black didn't really
have the time for it.} (13... c4 $13) 14. dxc5 bxc5 (14... Bxf3 15. Bxf3 Nxe5

This is natural as it gives White a ruined structure, but it also helps White
as he no longer has to spend a tempo on getting rid of the back rank weakness.}

the game.}) 21. gxf3 Nc3 22. Rc4 Nd5 23. Bc5 Nb6 24. Rb4 Rd5 25. Bd6 Nc8 26.

White has two extra pawns, but they are weak and it seems as if the chances of
White winning this endgame is as good as Black holding it.} 29. Re1 Rd2 30. e6
