29... Qe7 {In the previous fifteen moves, both players moved around their
pieces without making significant progress. The tension slowly built up and
now White decides that it is time to drive away the black outpost on e4.} 30.
Qe1 $6 {But this is wrong. Trapping the knight with f2-f3 is a threat, but the
defense Nf6-d7-e5, attacking c4, is a good plan anyway. Moreover, the white
major pieces are now placed on unnatural squares.} Nd7 31. b5 $2 {This goes
too far: c4 is getting weak very soon.} Ne5 32. bxc6 bxc6 33. Qd1 Qf7 $17 {
White is losing a pawn with questionable compensation. Therefore he decides to
force matters and to sacrifice material.} 34. Rc2 Nxc4 35. Rxc4 $5 Qxc4 36.
Nxf5 {Diagramm # Surprising, but very interesting. If Black had to take on f5
or b2, White's decision would be fully justified. However, as often,
counterattack is the best defense!} Nxf2 $1 {I invested 10 of my remaining 15
minutes to check that this move is not just blundering away a piece. Although
I could not fully calculate all lines, this tactical strike looked
sufficiently promising.} (36... gxf5 $2 {is way too optimistic.} 37. Qxh5+ Kg8
38. Bxg7 Kxg7 39. Rb7+ Kf6 40. g4 {Diagramm # During the game, I thought that
White is just winning here. However, Black has a fantastic defense:} Qe6 $2 {
Here, we found a funny line in the post-mortem:} (40... fxg4 $1 41. Qxg4 Qf1+
$3 {If the engine recommends such a move, it is usually because it delays mate
by one move. In this case, however, the apparently senseless queen sacrifice
is the only way to put up resistance.} 42. Bxf1 (42. Kxf1 Ra1+ 43. Ke2 Ra2+ $11
{Attempts to escape the perpetual run into the fork Nf2:+.}) 42... Rg8 $16) 41.

reasonable practical compensation.}) 37. Kxf2 Qf7 {The point of the sacrifice
on f2: f5 falls with check and there will be tactics against the white king.}
38. Bxc6 $6 {Loses on the spot, but there was no satisfacatory defense.} (38.
Bxg7 Qxf5+ 39. Kg1 Kxg7 40. Bxc6 Ra2 $1 41. Qd4+ Kh6 $19 {is the point of 35. .

the black bishop are going to decide the game.} 41. Qb3 Qxb1 42. Qf7+ Bg7+ $19)
