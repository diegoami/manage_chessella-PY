The material is even but the activity of White's pieces gives her a clear edge.
Yet the h5-pawn is attacked and White must be careful. Zhukova played the next
few moves with great energy.} 28. Ne6 (28. g4 $1 {was also pretty strong, but
it is not so easy to weaken your kingside so drastically.}) 28... Bxe6 29. Qg4
$1 {Zhukova had prepared this nice zwischenzug.} (29. Rxe6 {was the natural
recapture but Black is doing fine after} Qxh5 $13) 29... Qf7 (29... Rf7 30.
Rxe6 {also puts Black under tremendous pressure.}) 30. Rxe6 {The rook is taboo
due to the g7 weakness.} Kg8 {This is a logical move getting the king out of
the b1-h7 diagonal.} 31. Qc4 Rd8 32. Bc2 $1 {[#]The bishop threatens to come to
b3 increasing the pressure in the position.} Kh7 $2 {As Nigel Short once
mentioned, "Blunders do not occur in vaccuum. They are often the result of
sustained pressure on the opponent."} 33. Rxh6+ $1 {The queen is undefended and
Kg8 is met with Rh8+. A very powerful performance by Zhukova.} 1-0
