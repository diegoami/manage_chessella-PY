1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Nbd7 {Until now we are following the game
between Levon Aronian and Vishy Anand. Here the Armenian went 5.Bf4 and Vishy
took the pawn with dxc4. Anish deviates with Qc2.} 5. Qc2 Bb4 {The most
difficult question of the game: is it a Nimzo, Queen's Gambit or Ragozin?} 6.
a3 Bxc3+ 7. Qxc3 O-O {Now we are somewhere in the Nimzo territory where instead
of dc4 Black has played Nbd7. Is this line inferior to the main line? Well,
Vishy shows that when you are well prepared even inferior lines look good.} 8.
Bg5 h6 9. Bh4 c5 {Black is playing very logical chess. As he is ahead in
development he is trying to break the centre.} 10. e3 cxd4 11. Qxd4 { This is
the first new move but at the highest level nothing really has been known about
this line. So Anish was thinking at the board. Vishy on the other hand was well
prepared.} (11. exd4 dxc4 12. Bxc4 Nb6 $11) 11... Re8 $5 { Subtle preparation
by the Indian ace. The move in itself is not so scary. But when you know that
your opponent has prepared it in detail and you haven't even seen it, then you
shy away from the most critical move, cxd5, which is what Anish did.} 12. Bxf6
(12. cxd5 e5 {Is this really so strong? As Anish said in the press conference I
am ready to face this move against Anand but against Anand and computer it is a
little bit too much.} 13. Qd2 (13. Qd1 Qa5+ 14. Qd2 Qxd5 {regains the pawn but
White maintains an edge after} 15. Rc1 $14) (13. Bxf6 Qxf6 14. Qd2 Qg6 $5 $44
(14... e4 15. Nd4 Nb6 {is also possible.})) 13... g5 $5 14. Bg3 g4 15. Nh4 Ne4
16. Qb4 Ndf6 17. Bd3 Qxd5 18. Rd1 $14 { This might not be a thorough analysis
of the line, but I think Anand must have worked out the details really in great
depth after cd5 e5.}) 12... Nxf6 13. cxd5 Nxd5 (13... Qxd5 {is also possible.})
14. Be2 {White has a small edge mainly because of the c8 bishop. But Black can
equalize without too many difficulties.} Nf6 $1 (14... e5 15. Nxe5 (15. Qc5
{This is the move that Anand was aftraid of. But I think Black is completely
fine here after} e4 16. Nd4 Qg5 $36) 15... Qa5+ 16. b4 Nxe3 $1 17. Qxe3 Qxe5
$11) 15. Qxd8 Rxd8 {As Giri said after the game, I held no illusions that I
could win such position against Vishy.} 16. O-O Bd7 17. Rfc1 Rac8 18. Kf1 Kf8
19. Ke1 Ke7 20. Ne5 Rxc1+ 21. Rxc1 Rc8 22. Rxc8 Bxc8 {More pieces are exchanged
and the game finally ends in a draw.} 23. f4 Nd7 24. Nxd7 Bxd7 25. Kd2 Kd6 26.
Kc3 e5 27. g3 b6 28. Bc4 f6 29. b4 g5 30. h4 gxh4 31. gxh4 {A relatively good
result for Anand especially considering that he was black. Giri is still
searching for his first win in the event.} 1/2-1/2
