{Something went wrong for White, as Black would have a preferable position
after taking back on a5. But Fressinet found an immediate kill! Ready for some
calculation?} 26... Nh4 $1 27. Nb3 (27. gxh4 {doesn't work in view of the
immediate mate or massive material loss after} Bf3) 27... Be2 $1 28. Bxe2 Qh3 {
What else to do but resign? Unhappy moments for Naiditsch but his fighting
games will pay off next time. As for Fressinet, this game brought him on a7/9,
sharing 1st place with Sargissian and Harikrishna.} 0-1
