1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O d6 (6... e4 { is the
much sharper line.}) 7. d3 h6 8. Na4 $5 {Of course, the idea of this move is to
catch the bishop on b4.} a5 9. b3 Re8 10. Bb2 Bf5 11. e3 Qe7 { The main reason
why the queen is not so well placed on e7 is because from d7 it can prepare the
bishop going to h3, and also the e7 square can be kept free for the knight on
c6.} ({After the game Hikaru said that he knew Qd7 wasn't a good move. It seems
like he confused this position with some other position, or he saw something
really deep, because on the surface Qd7 looks perfectly alright. The thing to
worry about is surely d4 trying to trap the bishop. So let's have a look at
that move.} 11... Qd7 12. d4 e4 13. Nh4 Bg4 14. Qc2 d5 $5 (14... g5 {now
doesn't work due to} 15. f3 $1 {and now Black would have hoped that his queen
was on e7.}) 15. a3 Bf8 16. Nc3 {and this might be the position which has to be
delved into.}) 12. a3 (12. d4 e4 13. Nh4 Bg4 14. Qc2 g5 $15) 12... Bc5 13. Nc3
(13. h3 $5 $14 {I like this move because it takes advantage of the fact that
the queen and the bishop have not taken control of the c8-h3 diagonal.}) 13...
Qd7 {Now that d4 is no longer a threat, Black puts his queen on the right spot
and prepares Bh3.} 14. Nd5 (14. Re1 $5 {should have been given a serious
thought, as the g2 bishop is the soul of the position, and keeping it on the
board is in White's favour.} Bh3 15. Bh1 $14) 14... Nxd5 15. cxd5 Ne7 16. d4
exd4 17. Nxd4 {White would have had a pretty big edge here if his rook was on
e1. As it turns out the rook is still on f1 and the bishops can be exchanged
with Bh3.} Bh3 $1 $11 18. e4 c6 19. dxc6 Nxc6 20. Bxh3 Qxh3 21. Nxc6 bxc6 22.

oppotunity to play for a win with the extra pawn.} axb4 26. axb4 Qe6 27. Qxe6
