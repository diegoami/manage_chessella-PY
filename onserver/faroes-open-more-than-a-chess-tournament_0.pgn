Olomouc Grandmaster Closed 2013}) 6. c3 a6 7. a4 Ba7 8. h3 $6 {In general,
White should refrain from playing h3 before Black short castles, as this gives
Black a 'hook' for Black's attack on the kingside.} h6 9. Re1 $6 (9. b4 g5 10.
Be3 {is an important move against this g5-g4 idea, as it neutralises the a7
bishop which can be quite powerful in the kingside attack.}) 9... g5 $1 {
Through the hazy fog of my early morning brain, I was still able to remonstrate
myself for my stupidity in repeating a known mistake.} 10. Nh2 g4 $1 11. hxg4
Rg8 12. g5 $2 (12. Be3 {the same principle, eliminating one of the most
dangerous attackers.} Bxe3 13. Rxe3 Nxg4 14. Nxg4 Bxg4 $132) 12... hxg5 { White
has closed the g-file, but the h-file is now open.} 13. Be3 g4 $2 { This move
unneccesarily wastes a tempo for Black as the knight is forced to move from
c6.} (13... Bxe3 $142 14. Rxe3 Rh8 $17) 14. Bxa7 Nxa7 15. g3 Nh7 16. Kg2 Qf6

own king. I somehow assumed that the g4-pawn was threatened, completely missing
the idea of Qf2+ until I played it.} O-O-O 21. Qf1 Nf4+ 22. Kf2 Nh5 (22... gxf3
{is just a pawn up for Black with a still dangerous attack. }) 23. Nd2 Nxg3 {I
was quite prepared to lose here and was already counting how much rating I
would lose 'below 2500' etc...} 24. Kxg3 gxf3+ 25. Kf2 Rg2+ 26. Ke1 Re2+ 27.

Black who can play for win.} Nc6 33. Rf6 Re8 34. Rg1 Kd7 35. Rg2 Rh3 36. Nf3
Rhh8 37. Rg7+ Re7 38. Rff7 Rhe8 39. Nh4 {I decided to offer a draw, completely
sure that he would reject it, for Black has no way to lose from here and only
he can press. My opponent surprised me by accepting.} 1/2-1/2
