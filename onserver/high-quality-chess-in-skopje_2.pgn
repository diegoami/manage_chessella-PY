1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d5 5. O-O O-O 6. c3 $5 {Kramnik plays as
if he has the black pieces. But as we have seen recently, an opening advantage
is not really something that he is looking for.} b6 7. c4 $5 {Losing a tempo â€“
but so what?!!} c6 8. Ne5 Bb7 9. Nc3 Nbd7 10. Qa4 Nxe5 11. dxe5 Ne4 (11... Nd7
12. cxd5 cxd5 13. Nxd5 Nc5 (13... Nxe5 14. Rd1 $36) 14. Qc4 e6 $132) 12. Nxe4
dxe4 13. Bf4 e3 $5 14. Bxe3 Bxe5 15. Rad1 Qc7 16. c5 $1 {These are just the
kind of positions one would dread to have against Kramnik. He is just so good
at minute advantages. And by the way the move c5 is a very typical one against
the b7 bishop. The game Karpov-Lautier comes to mind.} Bxb2 17. Qb3 Bf6 18.
cxb6 axb6 19. Bxb6 Qc8 20. Rc1 {The c6 pawn is weak and the a2 pawn is not.
This is good enough for Kramnik to continue grinding.} Qg4 {Nepomniachtchi's
moves are filled with energy, but Kramnik's cool and calm response make them
look pretty futile.} 21. Rc2 Ra6 22. Bf3 Qa4 23. Qxa4 Rxa4 24. Rd1 {Looking to
infiltrate down the d-file.} Ba8 25. Bc5 $1 {c6-c5 will not be allowed!} (25.
Rd7 c5 26. Bxc5 Bxf3 27. exf3 Rc8 {Is just the kind of situation that you don't
want. You have an extra pawn but the opponent has managed to activate his
pieces.}) 25... Rb8 26. a3 e5 27. e3 e4 28. Be2 Rb7 29. Rc4 $1 {Getting rid of
the only active black piece.} Rxc4 30. Bxc4 {Look at the bishop on a8. The rest
is just so so easy for the 14th World Champion.} Kg7 31. a4 Be7 32. Bxe7 Rxe7
33. a5 f5 (33... c5 {Now you can activate your bishop, but after} 34. Rd6 {it
will still remain passive on a8 and the pawn on e4 is not doing any favours.})
34. Rd8 Ra7 35. a6 Kf6 36. Re8 {The rook is tied down to the bishop on a8 and
the bishop cannot move. The king has been cut off. All in all, it's now White
kings time to get into the battle.} c5 37. Kf1 Kg7 38. Ke2 Bc6 39. Rc8 Bd7 40.
Rg8+ (40. Rxc5 {is possible, but as you already know, White doesn't need to win
pawns anymore. He just has to keep control.}) 40... Kh6 ( 40... Kf6 41. Rb8
{and Bc6 is not possible because of Rb6.}) 41. Rb8 Bc6 42. Rb6 Ba8 43. Bb5 Rc7
44. Kd2 Rc8 45. Kc3 Kg5 46. h3 $1 {No counterplay.} h5 47. Kc4 h4 48. Re6 hxg3
49. fxg3 {Next the rook comes to e8 and it's game over. A fantastic positional
game by Kramnik. Wouldn't you agree?} 1-0
