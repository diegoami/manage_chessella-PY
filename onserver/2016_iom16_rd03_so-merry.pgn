9. Bh6 Bxc3 {A crucial moment since Black now gives up the dark squared bishop
but if he can keep the position closed, he may be able to attack the doubled
pawns later.} 10. bxc3 Ne5 11. Bg7 Rg8 12. Bxe5 {Now Wesley So returns the
favour by taking on e5, I believe the point is that the pawn on c5 will always
be weak and the dark squares on the kingside are always under fire.} dxe5 13.
h4 Nd7 14. Bd3 Nb6 15. Ne2 h5 16. Rb1 Nd7 17. Kf2 {So already has a clear
advantage, not only in development and space but in targets to attack on both
sides of the board.} Qc7 18. Rb2 b6 19. Bc2 Nf6 20. Nc1 Kf8 21. Nd3 Qd6 22.
Rhb1 Rb8 23. Qe3 Nd7 24. Qh6+ Ke8 25. Ba4 {Every white piece is active and
attacking, what more could you ask for. A very clean game from the impressive
Wesley So!} f6 26. Qh7 Kf8 27. Bc6 Rg7 28. Qh6 Kf7 29. Rb3 b5 30. Nb2 Nb6 31.
