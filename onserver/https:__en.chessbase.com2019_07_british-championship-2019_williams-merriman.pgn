Qb1 $1 {Crucially setting up a check on c8, this slows down Black's
counterattack.  Just before this in the commentary room, self-styled "chess
personality of the year" Lee Bullock was happy to point out that his engine
gave Qb1 as White's top move. The ball is passed back to Black.} Rg3+ $2 {
and he swipes it into the net.} ({Resolute calculation was needed here, but
John was already short of time. With} 1... Qe8 $1 {he could have already
forced a draw.} 2. Rxd6 Rg3+ $3 3. Kxg3 (3. Kh2 Qe2+ {transposes}) 3... Qe3+ {
and remarkably, there is no good way for White to avoid the perpetual check.}
4. Kg2 (4. Kh4 Qg5+ $11) 4... Qe2+ 5. Kh1 Qf3+ 6. Kg1 Qg3+ 7. Kf1 Qf3+ 8. Ke1
Qh1+ 9. Kd2 Qxb1 {does not favour White as the Black queen is too active.}) 2.
Kf2 Rxh3 3. Qf5 $1 {Now White covers the net, ready for any lobs.} Qxf5+ 4.
gxf5 Be5 (4... Bc5 5. Rxc5 bxc5 6. d6 {and the pawn makes a break for glory.})
5. Rd1 Rh5 6. d6 Rxf5+ 7. Ke3 Bxd6 8. Rcxd6 {Black has a few pawns for the
rook, but Simon was able to safely steer the game towards victory.} 1-0
