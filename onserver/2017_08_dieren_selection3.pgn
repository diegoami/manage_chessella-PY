Interzonal played in Goteborg (hence the name of the variation) on three

playing White against three Argentine (Panno, Pilnik and Najdorf), the exact
same position appeared. Without much thought, they all played the mind-blowing
and by now well known theory:} 13. Bb5 $1 {The 2nd piece is offered for a
