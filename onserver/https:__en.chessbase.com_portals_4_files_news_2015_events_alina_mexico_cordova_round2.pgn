{Playing two rounds a day has always been and will ever be a tough affair. The
Mexican Independence Cup was no exception even though it had a shorter playing
format: seven rounds instead of the usual nine. It was therefore of vital
importance to start the tournament on a good note and to keep a srict
supervision on the energy resources. Winning by forfait in the first round can
be considered as a very nice present for Emilio Cordova, who only played six
games in the end. Well... not quite so, as I always mentioned that entering
"the zone", or to put it differently, getting your head around the chess
pieces is easier said than done. I am sure you have witnessed many "surprises"
on the very first day of many Opens.  This could have happened to the Peruvian
GM in the second round (his first game), had Fabian Gutierrez had just a
little bit more time. Oh, don't forget that in this part of the world the
rating is sort of some random numbers, since the players are much much
stronger than what the list is showing!  After a very promising middlegame and
a dangerously looking attack, Emilio took too many risks and ended up in a
rather lost position, which, however, was not lacking a couple of tricky ideas.
This is what I always admired in the strong players, their ability to keep on
standing up after falling, to turn the tables around even in the most
unpleasant scenarios!} 27... Qf6 $2 {In fact, it looks logical, as it seems to
prevent both threats: h5 and Rxb3, right? Unfortunately not...} ({Instead,} 
27... h5 {parries h4-h5 and puts aside an exchange for Black, as after} 28.
Rxb3 Ba4 {I don't see how White can still create disorder in Black's camp.})
28. Rxb3 ({Fabian Gutierrez was probably counting on} 28. h5 Qf4 29. hxg6 Qxg3
30. fxg3 Ba4 {and if} 31. gxf7 Nc5 {with material losses for White. As for the
other knight on b3, which was supposed to be defended indirectly... it was not.
}) 28... Ba4 {Compared to the previous line, with 27...h5 instead of 27...Qf6,
there is suddenly a problem:} 29. Rxb7 $1 Bxd1 {and} 30. e5 $1 {I believe this
is what escaped Black's calculation, which once again makes the g6-knight
vulnerable and the game impossible to save.  In spite of this hair-rising
moment, Emilio Cordova was undoubtedly the deserved winner of the event, as
all his games were hard fought and a joy to watch.} 1-0
