1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch gambit came as a surprise for the World
Champion.} exd4 4. Nxd4 Bb4+ 5. c3 Be7 $5 {"I just decided that I must play
something over the board and I went for Be7", is how Magnus explained his
decision.} 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. Bd3 d6 (7... Nf6 8. e5 Nd5 9. O-O $16) 8. O-O Nf6 9.
Re1 O-O 10. Nd2 Re8 11. Nf3 {White has played the opening well and can claim a
small edge.} Nd7 (11... Bg4 $5 {Finishing development could have been a good
way to continue.}) 12. Bf4 Nc5 (12... Rb8 {seems better than what Magnus chose.
}) 13. Bc2 Bg4 14. h3 Bh5 15. Be3 Nd7 16. Ba4 {White already has a very
tangible advantage.} c5 (16... Ne5 17. g4 $18) 17. g4 Bg6 18. e5 (18. Bc6 Rb8
19. Qa4 Nb6 20. Qxa7 $14) 18... Rb8 19. Bf4 $2 {This was the critical mistake
of the game. An inexplicable error by Wesley. Carlsen calculated again and
again to check what he had missed. But it turned out that he had missed
nothing, and boldly took the pawn on b2.} (19. b3 $14 {Black is the only
one suffering here.}) 19... Rxb2 $1 20. exd6 Bxd6 21. Rxe8+ Qxe8 22. Bxd6 cxd6
23. Qxd6 {After a forced sequence of moves we have reached this position
where Black's knight on d7 is in trouble. Is it all over for Magnus? Of course
not!} Qe2 $1 {This is the move that Carlsen had seen in advance. Getting out
of the pin and threatening the f2 pawn.} 24. Qg3 (24. Rf1 Qxf3 25. Qxd7 h5 $17)
24... Nf8 25. Re1 Rb1 26. Rxb1 Bxb1 27. Bc6 Bxa2 {Black has won a pawn and is
clearly pushing.} 28. Qd6 Qc4 29. Ne5 Qxc3 {Losing the second pawn. Perhaps it
was a tad early to resign, but Wesley was pretty disgusted with his position.
In just a matter of few moves he had allowed a better position to turn into a
lost one.} 0-1
