{Fridman won a very tough battle against 'On Fire' Fedoseev. In a complicated
battle Fedoseev played very enterprising chess, sacrificing a piece for the
attack, but a mistake at a crucial moment cost him his advantage and left him a
bit worse, after which Fridman never gave him a chance to come back.} 1. e4 e5
2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3 c6 4. Nf3 d5 5. Bb3 Bd6 {This line is not as fashionable as it
used to be. I wonder what Fedoseev had prepared against the typical Italian
set-up.} 6. Nc3 dxe4 7. Nxe4 (7. Ng5 O-O 8. Ncxe4 Nxe4 9. Nxe4 Bf5 10. Qf3 Bxe4

for the bishop pair.} 12. O-O Nc5 13. Be3 Nxb3 14. axb3 Qc7 15. Rfd1 a6 16. Bb6

7... Nxe4 8. dxe4 h6 {A rare choice but I am sure Fridman would know this move
as his wife IM and four times US-champion Anna Zatonskih employed it against
Vallejo in 2010! Nevertheless, I am a bit skeptical about this move in general.
Black gives up a valuable tempo which could give White a very dangerous
initiative in return.} 9. O-O (9. Be3 { is what 'Paco' Vallejo played but I
guess Fridman had a different move order in mind:} Qe7 (9... a5 10. Qd2 a4 11.

is the move called for!} Bc5 13. Bxc5 Nxc5 14. Bxf7+ $1 {A must for this kind

this is really dubious!} ({Instead Black needed to play} 14... Kxf7 $1 15.

move' in Fridman's calculations?} 20. Rxf6+ Rf7 21. Qxh6+ {worthy of

for a win with Qf8.}) 15. Qd6 $1 {an important tempo-winning move.} Ne6 16.

Fedoseev was playing for a win or if this was just a tactical oversight.} (23.

avoids the check on f8.} 25. Ng6 b6 26. h4 Nxg4 $1 {Thorough calculation and
understanding from Fridman.} 27. Ne7 Bb7 28. Rd7 Ba6 $1 {This is the idea
behind Nxg4. The discovered check does not yield more than a pawn!} 29. Nxc6+

of care and accuracy. Black has one big advantage: the h-pawn's promotion
square is the same color as his bishop. Thus, exchanging knights would lead to
a simple win.} 36. Nb5 Ke5 37. c4 Nf6 38. b4 h5 39. a4 Ne4+ 40. Kh3 Nd6 $1 {We

White's knight and queen before grabbing the pawns!} 45. Ne1 Be4 (45... Be4 46.
