{The reason why I selected this game is because of the unusual opening played
by Nigel Short and the fact that a completely dubious sacrifice created quite a
few practical problems even for a 2686 player.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 a6 $5
{What is that?!! Well the line isn't so rare. It has been played in nearly 500
games and essayed by top players like Romanishin.} 4. Bg5 h6 5. Bxf6 Qxf6 6.
Nc3 d6 7. Qc2 g6 8. c5 $5 Qd8 (8... dxc5 9. Ne4) 9. e3 dxc5 10. Bd3 { Esen
Baris plays in quite a creative mood, but this pawn sacrifice isn't so great.}
cxd4 11. exd4 (11. Bxg6 dxc3 $19) 11... Bg7 12. Bxg6 $5 {In for a penny, in for
a pound!} fxg6 13. Qxg6+ Kf8 {White really doesn't have anything much over here
for the sacrificed piece. Yet in a practical game there are always chances to
go wrong.} 14. O-O Nc6 15. Rfe1 Nxd4 $1 {Nigel doesn't see any ghosts and picks
up another pawn.} 16. Nxd4 Bxd4 17. Ne4 Qe8 (17... Qe7 18. Rad1 e5 $19) 18. Qg3
Rg8 (18... Qe7 {Defending the c7 pawn was better. Maybe Nigel was afraid of}
19. Re3 $5 {If the rook is taken then fxe3 and the f-file opens. Even that
seems to be totally fine for Black, but a better defence is} Rh7 $1 20. Rf3+
Rf7 $19 {When all is well.}) 19. Qxc7 Qe7 $6 (19... Qd7 { was better as we
shall we in the game.}) 20. Qf4+ Kg7 21. Ng3 $1 {Now Nf5+ is a huge threat
which wouldn't have been the case if the queen were on d7. Also the bishop on
d4 would have been defended.} Bf6 $1 {Nigel remains alert and tries to find the
best possible defensive moves in a situation that has completely gone haywire
for him.} 22. Nf5+ exf5 23. Rxe7+ Bxe7 24. Qc7 Kf7 25. Re1 $14 {Materially
Black is doing fine, but his king is weak and so are his pawns. White should be
slightly better here.} Be6 26. Qxb7 Rad8 27. Qxa6 { Black has lost many pawns,
but it seems he has co-ordinated himself to some extent.} Bd5 28. g3 Bf6 29. a4
Rge8 $1 30. Rf1 (30. Rxe8 Rxe8 31. Kf1 {would have been better.}) 30... h5 31.
b4 h4 $1 32. a5 hxg3 $1 {The game is over after this.} 33. hxg3 (33. fxg3 Bd4+
$19) 33... Bf3 $1 (33... Rh8 {Maybe Esen thought that he could meet this with
f3 and be still alright. As it turns out the move f3 can be stopped before
playing Rh8.}) 34. Qc4+ Kg6 35. Qb3 Bd5 36. Qd3 Ba8 37. Qc2 Bd4 $1 {Pinning the
f2 pawn and threatening the deadly Rh8.} 38. Qc4 Rh8 39. Qe6+ Kg5 40. Qe7+ Kg4
{[#] This might not end up as another king walk legend by Nigel Short, but it
nonetheless was a very exciting game.} ({The game could have continued} 40...
Kg4 41. Qh4+ Rxh4 42. gxh4 Kf3 43. Rc1 { (say)} Rg8+ 44. Kh2 Be5+ 45. Kh3 Rg2
46. Rh1 Kxf2 47. h5 Rg3+ 48. Kh4 Bf6#) 0-1
