1. d4 {1.e4 is much more common in Carlsen's games lately. This could mean
an invitation for his opponent to go for his favourite fianchetto defence.} Nf6

(2757), Wijk aan Zee 2015.}) 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Nf3 {and we transposed back to the
main line} Bg4 {I think this is riskier.} ({I am wondering what was Carlsen's
plan against the more reliable} 10... Rd8 {which Grischuk already played in
the past.} 11. d5 e6 12. Bg5 f6 13. Be3 Nc6 14. Bd3 b6 $1 (14... exd5 {was
considered dangerous for some time because of the following queen sacrifice:} 15.

for Black, though White is still the one pressing.}) 27. Rc2 Qb1 28. Nd2 axb3 29.

be that good.} 12. gxf3 b5 13. f4 $16 {planning to block the important g7-bishop.} (13.

would not impress Grunfeld players too much:} Bxf3 13. gxf3 Rc8 14. Bb4 (14. Bd4

and better play on the dark squares, Black gets typical compensation.}) 12... Nd7

c4 14. Nd4 Bxe2 15. Qxe2 Ne5 16. f4 Nd3 17. Rc2 {looks dubious for Black.} (17.
Rb1 $5)) 14. Bxf3 c4 {with Nc5/e5 ideas and the pressure on c3 - Black looks fine.
} 15. Be2 {White makes room for the f2-f4 push.} Rfd8 $6 {feels like the wrong
rook. Not only will this rook be missed on the kingside, also the rook on a8 could
sometimes (after f4-e5) become a target.} (15... Rad8 {looked more normal.} 16.
f4 Qa3 17. Bf3 Nc5 18. e5 f6 $132 {Here we see a clear difference between the
two rook moves.}) 16. f4 {Now Grischuk went into the thinking tank mode, using for
his next three moves a whopping one hour!} Nb6 $6 {is a move that feels quite
slow as the knight is preventing e5 but not doing much else. Now White can play for
h4-h5 or even f5 and things start to look really dangerous for the black king.} (

looks like an interesting try with good attacking chances.}) 18... Nb6 $13 {
uses the rook on b8.}) (16... Rac8 17. Bf3 Nc5 18. e5 Nd3 19. Rb1 $14) 17. Bf3 (17.

18. h4 $1 $16 {Now Black's position looks critical.} e6 {doesn't achieve its
aim as White's attack is faster.} ({In case of} 18... b4 {the most direct would
be} 19. h5 Bxc3 20. Qf2 Bg7 21. hxg6 hxg6 22. Bg4 $40) 19. h5 Na4 {Now it was
the turn of the world champion to sink into a deep think.} 20. hxg6 {After 20
minutes Carlsen chose the most straightforward approach.} hxg6 21. f5 $1 {
preparing to completely shatter Black's kingside defences.} exf5 22. exf5 Qd6 ({

probably be} 24. d6 $1 Rxd6 25. Rxc3 Qxc3 (25... Bxc3 26. Bd5+ Kh7 27. Rf7+ Bg7

gxf5 25. d6 $18 {Now Black is completely lost.} Rab8 26. Bd5 {naturally
building up the attack.} Nc5 27. Bg3 Ne6 (27... Ne4 {would allow the world
champion to finish the game with a nice rook sacrifice.} 28. Bxe4 fxe4 29. Rxf7 $1

does White have extra material, but also he continues the attack!} Qb6 31. Qf3 Rf8 32.

the middlegame for the World Champion to show us his true strength!} 1-0
