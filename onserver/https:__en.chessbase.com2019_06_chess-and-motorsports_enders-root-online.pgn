Qa5 12. g5 Ne8 {I considered the right move, 12...Nh5, but rejected it because
I worried that White could eventually play Ng3 to dislodge it. But the move I
chose allowed White to attack without any resistance from me. Kory did a great
job with his checkmating attack from here onwards.} 13. h4 f5 14. h5 Ne5 15.

resigned because I am losing a piece to a fork. Then Kory confused the terms
"forked" and "pinned." After I clarified, we agreed that I would teach Kory
chess terminology and he would teach me racing terminology when we met in
person.} 1-0
