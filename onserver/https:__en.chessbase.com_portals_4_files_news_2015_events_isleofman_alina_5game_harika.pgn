{Harika played a great tournament, although she may perceive it differently
due to the unfortunate eighth round. However, having to play each and single
game for 7 hours (or more!) and against top GMs is not a picnic. This is the
reason why me, as a spectator, I remarked her fighting spirit and how she
defended very tough positions and even turned them around, just like this one:
Black didn't find the study-like-winning-mechanism, so are you ready for the
challenge?:) White to play} 66. Bd6+ {was chosen, which let the win slip.} (66.
Rg6 $3 {The main idea is blunt: deliver mate!} Rf2 {is the most stubborn
defence but I believe it is just not enough to hold a draw.} (66... a1=Q {is
not working} 67. Bd6+ Ke8 68. Rxf6 {Black can still move but oups! - no way he
can prevent mate on f8.}) (66... Ne8 {is another attempt to keep the game
going but fails to} 67. Bh6+ Ng7+ 68. Bxg7+ (68. Rxg7 {is also possible but
why hand your opponent hopes?} Rh2 69. Rf7+ Kg8 70. Rf1 Rxh6+) 68... Kg8 69.
Bf6+ Kh7 70. Kf7 $1 a1=Q 71. Rg8 {Similar to the other mate (on f8), when
Black has a lot of useless material and a final check will follow on h8.
Perhaps something to use, Yochanan Afek, in the next year's study?}) 67. Rxf6+
Kg7 68. Bh6+ Kh7 69. Rxf2 a1=Q 70. Rf6 {Great coordination and the d5-pawn
will fall soon.}) 66... Ke8 67. Kxf6 {A mistake never comes alone...the
endgame was very difficult and you may find a lot of pleasure analyzing it, so
go ahead and check the entire game if you feel like. From love to hate, from
winning to losing, it is just a tiny little step...} ({Better was} 67. Rf1 Nh7
68. Ra1 Ng5+ 69. Kxd5 Kd7 70. Bf4 Ne6 {Where I am not sure how to asses it;
looking at the board I would take White, as I would think the rooks are
stalemating each other. But the knight is a very interesting creature on the
chess board...maybe the outcome would have been a draw?}) 67... Rb1 68. Rg8+
Kd7 69. Ra8 a1=Q 70. Rxa1 Rxa1 71. Bf4 Ra8 72. Ke5 Kc6 73. Kf5 Rg8 74. Kf6 Re8
75. Be5 Kd7 76. Bf4 Re4 77. Kf5 Kc6 78. Kg4 Kb5 79. Kf3 Kc4 80. Bg5 {White was
thinking he reached a fortress already so he needs to sit still. Unfortunately,
it was not the case.} ({I don't see how Black could break White's fortress if} 
80. Kg4 Kd3 81. Kf5 {But not easy to defend such games, I think in practical
play more than 50% would be won with Black, since he can move around forever
or until White will collapse.}) 80... Kd3 {The black king is in and his white
opponent will soon find himself in zugzwang, as Harika will show further.} 81.
Bf4 Re7 82. Be5 Rf7+ 83. Bf4 Rf8 84. Kg4 Ke4 85. Kg5 Rf7 86. Kg4 Rg7+ 87. Kh4
Rg1 88. Kh3 Re1 {One of those games when she finished last in the tournament
hall:)} 0-1
