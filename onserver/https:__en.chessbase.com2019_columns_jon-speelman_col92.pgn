believe I was winning and decided to resign simply because my opponent reacted
in a way that made it seem like I was lost. JS Shock can do things like that

would be pretty good and indeed it wins too:} (30. Nef6+ Rxf6 (30... Kf7 $1 31.

{In 2009 I was invited to the National Scholars Chess Championships under 16
category less than 2 years after I started playing chess. After three rounds I was
on 3/3 and was paired against the tournament favourite who eventually won the
section. I chose this game not only because of the beautiful last move but
because I felt proud I had bested the tournament favourite.} 1. Nf3 c5 2. g3 d6

the centre. I would have thought that with the exchange of bishops the
