the game} Rxd1+ 19. Rxd1 Rd8 20. Rxd8+ Kxd8 21. Kb2 $16 {he already faces
serious problems. White's king is much safer than his opponent's, while White's queen

bad sign for Black to be so passive.}) 38. Rf8 Be4 $2 {looks like the decisive
mistake.} (38... Re6 $1 39. Rf7 Be4 40. Bxe4 Rxe4 {makes a substantial
difference compared to the game: White cannot get his dangerous passed pawn on
the kingside anymore.}) 39. Rxf6 Bxf3 (39... Ka6 40. Rf4 $16 {/+- was obviously
not Black's point.}) 40. gxf3 Re2 {Now we get to a rather unusual rook endgame. If
the b6 would be, say, on a6 Black would not have many problems getting a draw. As it
