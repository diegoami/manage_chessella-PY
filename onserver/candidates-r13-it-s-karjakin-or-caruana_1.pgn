Ludvig Hammer in Norway Chess 2015.} (10. b4 {is of course the natural follow
up but Aronian goes for Be3.}) 10... Qd7 11. b4 f6 12. Ne4 Nd5 13. Bd2 a5 14.

compensation.}) 19... Kh8 20. Rc1 Na7 $1 {Played after a long think. The
knight will be well placed on b5 and the other knight could go to c6. This
Nc6-a7-b5 is a great manoeuvre by Sergey.} 21. Bb4 {The main idea of this move
is to clear the d2 square for the knight on f3.} Nb5 (21... Nec6 22. Nd2 Nd4

Around this point Aronian was very happy with his position.} Bg6 24. Ne4 Nd5

exchange sacrifice with} 26. Rxb5 cxb5 27. Nd6 $5 Nc7 28. Bb4 $44 {White White
has full compensation for the missing exchange.}) 26. c6 $1 {Of course this
was prepared before hand by Aronian.} Qe7 (26... Qxc6 27. Qa1 $1 $18) 27. Qa2
bxc6 28. Rxc6 Bf7 29. Rc5 $1 {This move is not so easy to see but is extremely
strong. A lot of factors are at work here and the lining up of the g2 bishop
against the a8 rook is one of the reasons why White is clearly better.} (

) 36... a2 37. Bc3 Bg8 {At first sight it may seem that the position is just
winning for White as he has extra piece against the pawn. However, it is not
true. Black can defend this because the a2 pawn is just too strong.} 38. Ba1

he has two pawns.} 42. Ke2 Rd8 43. f4 {Aronian was pinning his hopes on this
