a5 {It needs to be said that at the time, my opening theory was quite close to
non-existent, and was mostly in the domain of 'principled play'.} 9. a3 Nh5 10.
b4 axb4 11. axb4 f5 12. Nd5 f4 13. b5 Ne7 14. Nd2 g5 {An attacking move, but I
was ready to give up the exchange for my rook on a8 if it bought me time to get
a lead in the race.} 15. b6 c6 16. Nc7 Ra5 17. Ne4 g4 18. Bd2 Ra2 19. Qb3 Rxd2
{Taking here is obvious and the only point of Ra2.} 20. Nxd2 Nf5 21. Rfc1 $2
{This is a blunder and completely underestimates the impending threats on his
king. Clearly I was not being taken seriously.} ({Years later, revisiting this
game, the engines pointed out a missed resource that neither I, nor Ricardo
ever saw.} 21. Bxc6 $5 bxc6 22. b7 Bxb7 23. Qxb7 {It is still unclear, unless
you are playing correspondence chess, but perhaps this was better than the
game's continuation.} fxg3 24. hxg3 Nhxg3 25. fxg3 Qg5 $1 {And I get back the
knight, since White must parry more serious threats like mate.}) 21... Bh6 22.

Rxb3 Rf2 {Both of use were quite short on time, in spite of the 40 moves in two
hours time control} 28. Be4 Bxd2+ 29. Kxd2 Qg5+ 30. Ke1 Qe3 31. Rc2 Qxg3 32.
