Bxc6 {Setting the prelude to a typical Anand game: tactically-justified
operations from a seemingly quiet position, which land him in the driver's
seat by move 30.} dxc6 9. Nc4 Nd7 10. Re1 Bf8 {This might look unduly passive,
but all truly strong players know that the bishop controls more squares from
the back rank.} 11. d4 exd4 12. cxd4 Nb6 (12... Nf6 13. Nce5 Be6 14. h3 Nd7 15.
Nd3 $14 {Alekseev,E-Godena,M Eilat 2012}) (12... Qf6 $5 {Going for ...b6 and ..
.Qg6.}) 13. Nxb6 cxb6 14. h3 b5 15. Bf4 {Both sides play this part of the game
extremely well and in accordance with well-established plans.} Be6 16. Re3 f6
17. b3 Qd7 18. Qc2 Rad8 19. Rd1 Qf7 20. Bg3 Qh5 {In fact it is only with this
move that Black commits to something- or rather commits to not doing something.
The kingside pawn-storm had been an option for a while and now Black decides
against it- in the process allowing Bc7-b6-c5.} (20... a5 $5) (20... h5 21. e5
fxe5 22. Nxe5 Qf5 $11 {was perhaps a more typical way of playing with the
bishop-pair.}) 21. Bc7 Rd7 22. Bb6 Bb4 $6 {Somewhere around here Black gets
into a worse position.} (22... Bf7 $11 {also prevents Bc5, and seemingly at
lower cost.}) 23. Ne1 $1 Bf7 24. Nd3 Bd6 25. Rde1 Bb8 26. f4 $1 {Perhaps
intending g4 next, squashing Black completely.} (26. g4 Qh6 27. Kg2 Bg6 {
is somehow not as good because the passive Black pieces are relatively
successful in attacking the White centre.}) 26... f5 (26... Qh4 $14) 27. Ne5
Bxe5 28. dxe5 fxe4 29. Qxe4 $16 {It transpires that Black can't stop g4, f5
and e6 in the long run.} Rd2 (29... Bd5 30. Qc2 Rf7 31. Rf1 g6 {might be best,
but White is significantly better after} 32. Qf2 Qh6 33. Bc5 $16) 30. R3e2 Bd5
31. Qe3 Rxe2 32. Rxe2 Qf5 {Trying to scare White off.} 33. g4 $1 Qb1+ 34. Kf2
h5 35. f5 Qh1 (35... h4 {is the last idea to keep the game in +/- territory,
but it looks precarious anyway after the steady} 36. Bd4 Qh1 37. e6 $16) 36.
Kg3 $1 {Not difficult to find, but completely winning.} Re7 37. Bc5 Re8 38. e6
