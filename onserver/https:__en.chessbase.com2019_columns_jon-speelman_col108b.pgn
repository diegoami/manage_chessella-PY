is to push g4 and this move gives it more support.  JS I'm really not sure
which is best. They also sometimes play a3 here to prevent ...Bb4. With the
bishop on d3 White can play Ne2 and c4 if he doesn't want to play g4 and that
also makes sense.} Be7 7. Ne5 O-O 8. g4 {A Knight on e5 often allows g4.} Ne4
9. gxf5 exf5 10. Nxe4 fxe4 11. Qd2 {Probably a mistake as the Queen is now cut
off from a Kingside attack. Instead, getting rid of the blocking Bishop
might've been better. Perhaps I was concerned about getting my King safe, but

wrong since White should make Black spend a tempo exchanging rooks himself and
Qg4 was obvious but my engine pointed out that Rae8! is a good idea then to
prepare Rf3. Still White can play h4-5 trhne and feels a bit better.:even if
it's really nothing.} (22. Qg4 Rae8 23. h4 Rf3 24. h5 Ref8 25. Re1 Rg8) 22...

whether to swap Queens, but eventually I figured this was pretty drawish as my
King is able to block a Queening threat in time.  JS Offering to go into a
pawn endgame is always a huge step since there may be little chance to recover
if it turns out to be bad. Here Black has miscalculated isnce the pawn ending
ishould be winning for White who can stop the g pawn and later play d5
exchanging d for g. As long as the blakc king is not then able to enter the
queenside, White will win the e pawn and that will be decisive.  I'm wrting
this slightly with hindsight since although the outlines are very clear, the
details are less so and you'd have to check that nothing would go wrong.} (

better of me and I was so afraid of his g-pawn that I was only thinking of a
draw. If I considered that I had my own threat I don't think it is too hard to
calculate the win. Something to learn from. Can you spot it?  JS A tough
battle in which Liam played nicely in the opening but began to go wrong and
would have bene under some pressure if his opponent had left him with a weak
e3 pawn.  After a lot of diffiuclt decisions, Black mistakenly went into the
pawn endgame but worried by the passed g pawn Liam believed him and didn't
imagine thta it could be he who was winning.   One lesson is that if you have
a clear draw in an endgame you should try to take a moment to refocus and see
if you might have even more.   In general when tackling difficult endgames or
difficult positions in general strong players will often first look for
something that seems to be enough for equality and having satisfied themselves
that they are okay then move on to try to find something even better.} (39...

doubling Black's pawns on the f-file and thereby also taking away a
centre-pawn.} Nf6 {I go for this as taking with the e-pawn allows me to

battle in which Liam was outplayed in the opening and got a clear disadvantage
but was able to fight back when his opponent cashed in inaccurately. The rook
and minor piece ending was complicated and after Black took the d file fairly
clearly winning for him. Exchanging into the pawn ending was crazy but when
Black blundered Liam took advantage and turned it round completely.} 1-0
