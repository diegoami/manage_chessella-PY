from Nakamura based on the fact that the rook is still on f8 and not e8.} 10.

sudden change of plans?} (20... Bh3 {was surely the normal way to continue and
would have given Black no real problems.}) 21. Nxe4 Bxe4 22. Bxe4 Rxe4 23. Rfe1

can look forward to at least a small edge.} Rxe1+ 24. Rxe1 Qf5 25. Re7 Rb8 26.
Kg2 $16 {White is clearly better. He has an active rook, the pawn on a5 is a
tad weak, while his bishop on b2 is perfect. All in all this should be a
typical Levon advantage which he can slowly and steadily convert with his good
technique. But look how quickly he messes things up.} Bb6 27. Qe2 d5 28. c5 (
