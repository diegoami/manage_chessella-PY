10. Re1 {Let's join the game from this point onwards. I have just played Re1
and am angling for e2-e4.} h6 {I was happy to see my opponent making this move.
While there is absolutely nothing inherently wrong with this move, allowing me
e4 made me feel quite good during the game.} (10... b5 $5 {This was the move
that worried me the most. If I cannot play e4, what am I supposed to do. Well,
sometimes the move that you want to make is the move you should make!} 11. e4

you, but for me it definitely was.} (12. e5 $2 bxc3 13. Bxc3 Ne4 $19) 12...

Bf5 14. Re3 {I put the rook on this square because it somehow just seemed
natural. Also I could put my queen on e2 and sacrifice the rook on e6 at some
point. I didn't know at what point it would happen, but such ideas were in the
air.} Rd8 15. Qe2 (15. d5 $1 {The computer thinks this is the best move, but
with the queen opposite the rook, I thought it was better to just place the
queen on e2 and then go for the d5 break.}) 15... a5 $6 {I already have a
feeling that this was not such a great move. Black has his pieces messed up and
it is important that he co-ordinates them. ...a5 is an extremely over ambitious
move. Black thinks that if he gets in a4, axb3 and exchanges the rooks down the
a-file he should be fine. Yes, that's true, but the plan is excruciatingly slow
and White can just blast the centre now.} 16. Nh4 (16. d5 $1 {is also worthy of
attention.} Bc5 {This somewhat traps the rook on e3, but White has the strong}

struggling.}) 16... Bh7 17. d5 {This is the natural consequence of White's
play.} cxd5 (17... exd5 18. cxd5 $16) 18. Rxe6 $1 {I liked this sacrifice!
Often you see a piece sacrifice on e6, but a rook is pretty unsual.} (18. cxd5

ignores the rook on e6, the rook continues his policy of gulping pawns.} 19.
