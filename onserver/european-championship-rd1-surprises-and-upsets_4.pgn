GM's draw offer. The black player, a much lower-rated IM, faces strong British
GM but thanks to his deep calculation and solid play he gets the upper hand

slightly better than Howell's choice.}) 16... Bb7  17. c5  Qxh2+ $1 { ( 08)
Howell, may have missed this.} 18. Kxh2  Rxa5 {(7) Now Black has great pawn
structure superiority and White's pawn on c5 is a great target.} 19. Na4  Ba6
$1 {(2:11) Another stratigically sensible move. Black gets rid of his bad
bishop.} 20. Bxa6  Rxa6  21. Kg1  Kf8  22. f3  Ke7  23. Kf2  Nd7  24. Ke2  Ra5 
25. Kd2 $1 {(7:38) The exclam goes to Howell's draw offer. It was going to be a
long suffering for White as Black could comfortably play h5-g6-e5-f5 and keep
improving his position while all White could do was to stall. Howell, offered a
draw before things got nastier. A wise decision on his part and not a very good
one from his opponent's side, who showed more respect to his opponent than to
his position.} (25. Kd2 h5 26. Rh1 g6 27. Kc3 Rb7 28. Kd2 e5 29. g3 Ke6 30.
Rhc1 f5 {and a very bad position for white.}) 1/2-1/2
