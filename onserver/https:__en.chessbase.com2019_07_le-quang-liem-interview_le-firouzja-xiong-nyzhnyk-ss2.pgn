1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 a6 4. g3 $5 {Le Quang Liem doesn't indulge in a
theoretical debate with the youngster.} Nf6 5. Bg2 g6 6. 0-0 Bg7 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 0-0 {Threoretically the fianchetto variation of the Dragon is not such a
big issue for Black, but it is a new position for Firouzja and Liem would be
happy about it.} 9. h3 Nc6 10. Be3 (10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. e5 dxe5 12. Bxc6 Bxh3 $17 )Nd7 (10... Bd7 {is the main move in the position.} )11. a4 Bxd4 12. Bxd4 Nxd4 13. Qxd4 b6 14. Rad1 Bb7 15. f4 {Somehow it feels that White has an
edge here because of the free flowing nature of the position and also the fact
that e5 is a small threat.} f6 {Firouzja tries to stop the move e5, but in
doing so weakens his king to some extent.} (15... Ra7 $5 16. h4 {White has the
initiative in any case.} )16. h4 $1 {This is a dual purpose move. It not only
aims to push further with h5 but also creates a square for the bishop to pop
out from h3.} a5 17. Rfe1 Rc8 18. Bh3 Rc5 19. Qe3 Nb8 20. Nd5 Bxd5 21. exd5 f5 (21... Rxc2 {was possible, but perhaps Firouzja felt it was a bit too much to
go for pawn grabbing when his position looked not so great.} 22. h5 $40 (22. Rc1 $5 Rxc1 23. Be6+ Kg7 24. Rxc1 Nd7 25. Rc6 $16 ))22. c3 Nd7 (22... Rf7 23. g4 $1 $16 )23. Qxe7 Nf6 24. Bf1 Qb8 25.

was in the cards.} fxe4 34. Qd4+ Kh7 35. Rxe4 Qf5 36. Kg3 Rf7 37. Re8 Rg7 38. Qe4 Qf7 (38... Qxe4 39. Rxe4 {is a hopeless endgame with no real scope for the
black rooks.} )39. Re6 {Black is tied up completely and White has so many
threats up his sleeve, including h5 or Rxd6. Firouzja resigned.} 1-0

flowing.} 1-0
