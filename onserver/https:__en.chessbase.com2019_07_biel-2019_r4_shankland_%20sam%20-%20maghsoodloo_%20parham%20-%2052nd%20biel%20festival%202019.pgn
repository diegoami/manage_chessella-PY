move, modern engines and me don't find it convincing enough!} (11... h6 12. Bh4

This seems to be Sam's attempted improvement.} (14. Bxf6 gxf6 {was previously

Qe3+ Kf8 20. Bd3 $14 {but here White's advantage is considerably lesser than
in the game.}) 16. Nxe5 Rb7 {Yet again, an innacuracy that makes Black's life
harder.} (16... Bc6 $1 {was crucial to surviving for now. It is true that after

opposite coloured bishops and open files on the queenside Black isn't lost

Nxd5 23. Bxd8 Rxd8 24. Ndxf7 $1 {wins a pawn, but after} Rf8 $16 {White has to
satisfy himself with two pawn weaknesses on a6 and e6. Meanwhile, though
Black's bishop is nearly dead, his knight is wonderfully placed on d5 and he
is the first to the f-file. White is better, but the game is not yet finished,
and Black has realistic chances to resist.}) 18. Qxd8+ $1 {Sam is alert.} Bxd8
19. Nxb5 axb5 20. Bxb5+ $1 {A piece sacrifice that looks pointless at first,
but the idea is to distract the Black rook from defending f7.} Rxb5 21. Rxd8+
$3 {and now the coup de grace - an exchange sacrifice to deflect the king from
defending f7, so that the knight can land there next move.} Kxd8 22. Nxf7+ Ke7
23. Nxh8 $18 {Sam finishes the game off with ruthless precision from here.} g5
24. Ng6+ Kf7 25. Ne5+ Kg7 26. c4 {A wonderful attacking game by Shankland!} 1-0
