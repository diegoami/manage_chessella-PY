1. Nf3  Nf6  2. c4  c5  3. Nc3  d5 {19 Harikrishna likes to play the
Semi-Tarrasch. Soon we reach something similar.} 4. cxd5  Nxd5  5. e3  e6  6.
Bc4  (6. d4 {would be the e3 variation of the Semi Tarrasch.}) 6... Nc6  7. O-O
 Be7  8. Qe2  O-O { 344 What Hari does is nice to learn from. He just develops
his pieces and gets his king to safety.} 9. Rd1  Nb6  10. Bb5  Bd7 {304 Once
again simple development. No flashy business.} 11. d4  cxd4  12. exd4 $1 { 7
Accepting the Isolani is the correct way to play.} (12. Nxd4 Nxd4 13. Rxd4 Bxb5
14. Qxb5 Qc7 {And Black has absolutely no problems.}) 12... Nb4  13. Bxd7  Qxd7
 14. Ne5  Qe8 $1 {423 A very nice idea. Hari realizes that sooner or later he
will play f7-f5 and hence the queen is well placed on e8.} 15. a3  N4d5  16.
Rd3  f5 {742 After this move the e5 square and e6 pawn become weak, but White
has no real kingside attack.} 17. Bd2  Bf6  18. Re1  Rc8  19. Rg3  Qe7  20. Bh6
 Kh8  21. Bc1  Kg8 {218 Hari has a comfortable position, but with the leader
and the black pieces, he is fine with a draw.} 22. Bh6  Kh8  23. Bc1  Kg8  24.
Rh3 {55 Eljanov shows great fighting spirit, although objectively this decision
is incorrect because only Black can have chances to fight for advantage.} Bxe5 
25. Qxe5  Rc6  26. Qe2  (26. Nxd5 Nxd5 27. Qxd5 $4 exd5 28. Rxe7 Rxc1+ $19)
26... Rfc8 {228 Black's harmony keeps improving.} 27. Bd2  Nxc3  28. bxc3  (28.
Bxc3 Nd5 $17 {is clearly better for Black.}) 28... Nd5  29. a4  Qf7  30. Rg3 
Nxc3  31. Rxc3  Rxc3  32. Bxc3  Rxc3  33. h3  Rc6 {91 Black has pinched a pawn
and White has to play carefully, in order to not let Black consolidate.} 34.
Qe5 $1  Qd7  (34... h6 {looked more human.} 35. Qb8+ Kh7 36. Qxa7 Ra6 37. Qc5
Rxa4 38. Qe5 Ra6 39. Rc1 {White has compensation and the game should most
probably end in a draw.}) 35. Qb8+  Kf7  36. Qxa7  Ra6  37. Qb8  Rxa4  38. Rb1 
b5  39. Rxb5  Ra8  40. Qe5  Rd8  41. Rb6  Qd5  42. Qxd5  (42. Qxd5 Rxd5 43. Rb4
{Theoretically Black is better but there is no way to win the d4 pawn and White
will hold with ease.}) 1/2-1/2
