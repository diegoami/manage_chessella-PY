1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 a6 5. g3 {The Catalan treatment of the Slav
leads to very interesting positions in which White usually has to sacrifice a
pawn and plays against the c8 bishop.} e6 6. Bg2 dxc4 7. Ne5 b5 8. O-O (8. Nxc6
{doesn't fare so well because of} Qb6 9. Ne5 (9. Na5 Ra7 $17) 9... Bb7 $11)
8... Bb7 9. b3 {This line with the pawn sacrifice became quite popular after
Kramnik played a beautiful positional game against Giri in Qatar 2014. Quite a
few developments have occurred in this line since then which we can understand
with the help of this game.} cxb3 (9... b4 {is not played by many black
players. But it is a very worthy alternative as Black gets a protected passed
pawn on c3.} 10. Ne4 $5 (10. Na4 {was considered the main move, but I guess
things will move in the other direction since the third game between Ding Liren
and Wesley So in their Shanghai Match which took place in May 2016.}) 10...
Nxe4 {The only logical move at Black's disposal.} (10... c3 $2 11. Ng5 $18) 11.
Bxe4 c3 12. a3 a5 (12... Nd7 {is also a possible avenue for black players in
the future.}) 13. axb4 axb4 14. Bf4 $11 {1-0 (38) Ding,L (2778)-So,W (2775)
Shanghai 2016. White has the freer development, Black has the extra pawn and a
dangerous one on c3. I would say that this position is worthy of further
investigation and a lot of new ideas can be found.}) 10. axb3 Be7 11. Ne4 {This
was played by Naroditsky after five minutes of thought and hence it was most
probably not his home preparaiton. It is a move that he came up with on the
board.} (11. Bb2 {was played by Kramnik and this looks like the best move.} O-O
12. Ne4 $1 {is the best move and after} (12. Qc2 {After the game Kramnik said
that he was very upset that he had made this minor inaccuracy. The point being
that the queen is not so well placed on c2 as Rc8 will launch a direct attack
against the queen.} Nbd7 $1 (12... Nfd7 $6 13. Nd3 $1 $14 {was Kramnik-Giri
Qatar Masters Open 2014.}) 13. Nxc6 $2 Bxc6 14. Bxc6 Rc8 {And now the bishop
cannot retreat due to b4. We see why the queen was misplaced on c2.}) 12...
Nxe4 (12... Nbd7 13. Nxc6 $1 $16) 13. Bxe4 $44 { White has excellent
compensation.} f6 14. Nd3 f5 15. Bg2 $14) 11... Nxe4 12. Bxe4 f6 $1 {Laznicka
immediately spots the flaw in White's setup - the d4 pawn is unprotected and
hence Nd3 is impossible. It is precisely for this reason that Black has
equalised without any difficulty.} 13. Nf3 (13. Nd3 Qxd4 $19) 13... Nd7 (13...
f5 14. Bc2 c5 {also looks pretty tempting for Black.}) 14. Bd2 f5 15. Ba5 Qb8
16. Bc2 c5 {Once Black gets this freeing break he shouldn't have any problems.}

Rd5 {Black's moves have been all quite logical and he surely maintains an edge
thanks to his extra pawn. Here Daniel decides to sharpen play by sacrificing
his bishop.} 27. Bxf5 $5 {[#]A move that stirs up some very interesting
complications. It must be mentioned that Daniel took only 7 mins and 32 seconds
to navigate through the complexities of the line. Quite impressive.} exf5 {The
most natural recapture.} (27... a5 $1 {The cold blooded move is the best one in
the position. But how can it be found without computer assistance. The e6 pawn
is under pressure and there can be myriad discoveries with the knight moving
from e5. Yet the computer suggests this emtionless a5!? What to do! As always
we have to agree!} 28. Bxc5 Rxc5 $1 ( 28... Bxc5 $6 29. Nd7 $1 Bxe3 30. Bxe6+

mate on g2 has to be averted.} 30. f3 $1 { The important thing is that Daniel
confidently calculated this calm move in which he is a piece down, fully aware
that he will win back the material.} Qd7 31. Qxc5 Rd1+ $6 (31... Qd4+ $1 $11

which is attacking usually has the edge. Here White's chances are preferable.}
