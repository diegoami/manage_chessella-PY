{It is surprising how often one can hear the never out of fashion and typical
chess complaint: "I was so much better but then strange things happened and I
even lost the game". The frustration grows in intensity if a player misses a
good chance in making history by winning or holding against a top class
opponent.  For some reasons the main point is forgotten: we don't play alone
and the stronger the opponent, the trickier it gets. We may have had our
chances but that could be partly due to deliberate action from the other side!
Rewards come to those who dare and Caruana didn't falter when the time had
come to take risky decisions.  Repeatedly in this event, he went for the
double-edged continuation instead of settling for a safer path. And that was
no gambling but calculated danger, showing not bravery but a great deal of
practicality. Obviously, it paid off.  The next three games illustrates this
remarkable attitude, where Caruana went for unbalanced play, giving chances
but also creating chances in return. At the end of the day, the 'no pain, no
gain' crowned beautifully his 'hazardous' play.} 1. d4 f5 2. Bg5 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7

Black is worse but at the same the game is open: both sides can make
positional or tactical errors. And that is the whole point of Caruana's
strategy: the other side is given multiple and equally good choices but which
one to make?! Slowly but surely the position goes from good to less good to
acceptable to...you know the drill. Fabiano simply wants to keep the game
going, even if the opponent is a strong one!} 11. O-O Bf6 12. hxg6 hxg6 13. Na4

{Fabiano had the same uncompromising attitude against the top female player,
deciding to offer an exchange for turning the game dynamic. In hindsight and
with the engine on, anyone can say "that was a bad idea". Objectively, many
moves can be considered 'bad' but over the board and in practical play
brilliancies come from errors too.} 19... Rfe7 {A nice idea to unbalance the
game with a positional exchange sacrifice, which could have been executed with
more precision, had we been machines.} ({Better was} 19... b6 $1 {followed by
the same idea as in the game, the difference being that this little pawn is
now saved, compared to what happened next.}) 20. d5 Ne5 ({Perhaps a better
alternative to give the exchange was} 20... Nd8 21. Bxf6 gxf6 22. Nh4 Nf7 23.

black king on the b1-h7 diagonal, where White has the pinning idea in place.})

you name it, would probably hold this but in a game I would blindly choose
Black with such a knight on e5 and the white pawns likely to fall, like the
teeth of an old person.}) 25... Qe8 26. Ra2 Nxe4 27. Rae2 Ng5 28. Qg4 {the
final mistake} ({But there's no blue sky after} 28. Qxg2 Nxh3+ 29. Kh2 Ng5 30.

{The games have ben thoroughly analyzed and for deeper lines I kindly suggest
checking the previous reports published on ChessBase. For now I only want to
make a point, the one of choice. This was the final round, which brought
Fabiano on a shared 1st place after defeating England's top player. Things
were far from being clear, especially over the board and Fabiano himself told
me he was suffering during the game but somehow got lucky.  Well, luck you can
also create with your bare hands and this is exactly what Caruana did. In this
position and given the tournament situation, many would have probably taken on
f6, which secures White a slight and pleasant edge but probably not more than
that. Instead, the no.2 in the world went for:} 20. Re1 $1 {Why not keep the
pressure and have some fun instead?! And offer Black options as well...} Qd7

mentioned. Ne6 would have kept the edge Black got in the last couple of moves.}

cute move which didn't pass unnoticed for the chess journalists. The idea
behind it is clear: freeing up the space for the rook.} Qxf4 35. Re1 Qf6 36.
Qg4 Nf7 {The final error which settled Black's fate, as Fabiano pointed out.
Adams missed that White can force the queen's trade, after which his position
becomes hopeless in the endgame.} (36... Kh7 {keeps the unbalanced position
balanced.}) 37. Re8+ Kh7 38. Re6 Qg5 39. Qxg5 Nxg5 40. Re7 c5 41. b5 axb5 42.
