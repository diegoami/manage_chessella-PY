Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Qxf6 gxf6 10. Nf3 $1 Nd7 {I had played this system myself as
Black, so I knew how difficult it is for White to make significant progress
even if he manages to occupy the squares in front of the double pawns.
Therefore I decided to give it a different treatment.} 11. Be2 (11. Nh4 Be7 12.

White then must fry to undermine Black's pawn structure. I was looking at} 13.

attempt to coax White into leaving Bg6 alone.} ({Once again,} 14... Nc4 {
was possible. I planned} 15. Nxg6 $5 {It's amazing how White is willing to
repair Balck's pawn structure.} (15. b5 $6 {is suspect:} Bb4 16. Rfc1 Bxc3 17.

able to establish a bind, but he certainly is trying.}) 15. Nxg6 $1 hxg6 16. b5
$14 Bd6 17. g3 Rb8 18. Rab1 O-O {I was reasonably happy with the way the
opening turned out. White has pressure against c6, and he can always count on
opening the second front with the timely h4-h5. The question was how to
balance active ideas with prophylactic play. I'm not sure I did the best job.}
19. a4 Bc7 20. Na2 Ne7 21. Nb4 Ba5 ({On} 21... Bd6 {White had the direct plan
of winning over the b-file:} 22. bxc6 bxc6 23. Na6 Rb6 24. a5 {etc.}) 22. Nd3

low on time, so I could tell he was not going to sit on his position for long.}

Bxb4 31. Rxb4 Rc5 32. Rbd4 Rd8 33. e4 {[#] White has achieved a thematic
advance based on the pin, but winning a pawn may not do the trick, as long as
Balck can establish a blockade on d6.} (33. g4 f5) 33... Re8 ({After the game
Gruenfeld advocated} 33... Rb8 {but then White can go} 34. R4d3 $5 dxe4 35.

A new stage begins. White will try to keep the knight from reaching any good
squares.} Kf6+ 41. Kf1 b6 42. Red1 Rc3 43. Rd3 {I felt a rook trade was in
order to help White use his king.} Rxd3 44. Rxd3 $16 Ke7 45. Rc3 Kd8 $6 {
Very strange.} ({Wasn't} 45... Kd7 {more logical? Then} 46. Ke2 Re8+ {pushes
the white king away from f4.}) 46. Ke2 Nd6 ({Still,} 46... Re8+ 47. Kd3 Nd6 {
would be much more resilient.}) 47. Ke3 Kd7 48. Kf4 {[#]} Rh8 49. Kg5 {The
white king is through, and the game is about over.} Ne4+ 50. Bxe4 fxe4 51. Rh3
