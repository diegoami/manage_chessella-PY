{(Note that special characters aren't given properly). I believe this study to
be rather famous, but possibly I am wrong on that. White is to move and win
and has a nice motive at his disposal which can be easy to solve once one has
the right idea.} 1. Rb7 Qxf7 ({Nothing else works as the Pf7 would decide. A

{The genre of short but highly tactical battles - for which there is no clear
definition, but rather a matter of perception by the audience - was reinvented
by Daniel Keith and Martin Minski in the past few years, but it dates much
further back. This position shows one battle that could be considered that way
but is ending with stalemate, as opposed to the "open-ended" nature of those
modern studies. White is to move and has to draw, and compared to other
stalemate studies the battle here feels sharp and tactical, although not very
difficult once one sees the solution.} 1. Rd5 Bxf3 ({Less tactical feeis the
other main variation that even suffers from a minor dual:} 1... Nd4 2. Rxd4

{For the other three studies, we will look at a few prizes won by Prokes. This
study has a beautiful idea which is bought with a knight on h1 that does not
participate. Such studies with geometrical motives that repeat on a line/rank/
diagonal were in the spirit of the Soviet school, but inspired also other
composers. Back in 1949, in fact, Czechoslovakia was part of the Union,
referred to as (abbreviated) CSSR or Czechoslovakian Soviet Socialist Republic.
This, however, likely did not influence the style of our hero, as by then he
composed for over two decades and grew up with his own style. More influence
will have had that he likely saw studies with similar motifs and tried to
create one himself, regardless of their country of origin.} 1. b6+ Ka8 2. a6
Qd5 $1 {After the introduction, the maneuver begins - one that on lack of
occasion is rarely seen in games in this form, although the basic idea is
known to almost every player.} (2... bxa6 $2 3. Bxa6 $18 {The two bishops here
win easily against the knight, as either Pg3 survives or checkmate follows.})

{This study shows in my opinion nice rook endgame tactics, ending in a
checkmate. White is to move and win, the top priority being saving his pawns. 
Note that the Ph5, which also is used to make White's moves unique, prevents 3.

prevented).} 1. Rd7+ (1. g6 $2 Kf6 $1 2. Rd4 Kxg6 3. Rxf4 Kg7) 1... Ke6 $1 {

White can move only his king now, Black can move neither king nor rook. In
practical games, usually there is more material on the board, making the
movable king decisive easily. Here there is only one winning way, but it is
nice.} 5. Kg2 $1 c5 6. Kh3 c4 7. Kh4 c3 8. Kg5 c2 9. Rxf8 Kxf8 10. Kf6 c1=Q 11.

studies suited for players to enhance their tactical understanding. Make sure
to check the links in the article for two collections of such studies. Here
White is to move and win, showing an echo, i.e. a repetition of a theme/idea

{This study can serve to illustrate how one theme can evolve into another.
There is nothing to be seen anymore of the original idea of our hero, rather
Ionchev's setting was taken but new play added. Sadly the position is heavy

hope. I won't bore readers with the support variations, and instead almost
only give the main line.} 1. Bc2 $1 Qxa1 ({The strength of the advanced pawn
