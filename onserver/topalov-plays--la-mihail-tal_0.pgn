1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. d4 dxc4 {Caruana goes for the Vienna Gambit.}
5. e4 Bb4 6. Bxc4 {This is not the first time that Topalov has played this
Gambit line. It goes perfectly well with his aggressive style.} Nxe4 7. O-O
Nxc3 8. bxc3 Bd6 $5 {Usually Black retreats his bishop to e7. But here he went
for the move Bd6. Although this is not a novelty, very few games have been
played with this move.} (8... Bxc3 9. Rb1 $44 {It has been proved that taking
the pawn on c3 is a mistake and gives White tremendous compensation.}) 9. Re1
O-O 10. Qd3 $146 (10. Ng5 {was played by Bacrot against Maze.}) 10... Nd7 11.
Ne5 Bxe5 12. dxe5 Nb6 {[%cal Gd7b6] When Caruana made this move he was sure
that he would either exchange the important light squared bishop or the queens.
However, Topalov had a huge surprise in store for him.} 13. Qg3 $3 {What an
amazing move by Topalov. The two exclamation marks are definitely not for the
objectively value of the move, but for the sheer boldness. Veselin gives up a
full piece for an attack which is far from being successful. But he figures out
that in an opposite coloured bishop position, having the dark squared bishop is
like having an extra piece! With the computer analysis we can arrive at the
truth that Black is winning, but still I really like Topalov's courage.} (13.
Qe4 Nxc4 14. Qxc4 b6 $15 {is not something White would like to go for. Black is
at least equal.}) 13... Nxc4 14. Bh6 g6 15. Rad1 Bd7 (15... Qe7 { might have
been a better move because now f6 is threatened.} 16. Bg5 (16. Bxf8 Kxf8 {is
just a lost position for White.}) 16... f6 17. exf6 Qf7 18. h4 Re8 $1 $19
{Black is just winning now as the move e5 cannot be prevented, with smooth
development for Black.}) 16. h4 Nb6 17. h5 {Topalov plays as if nothing really
has happened!} Qe7 18. Rd4 {Brining in another piece into the attack. Well,
even though the position is winning for Black, it is not so easy to just wait
and do nothing. The rook on f8 is hanging, but White is not taking it.
Meanwhile Fabi has to decide whether he should move the rook or let it be in
the line of fire forever. Such decisions seems quite easy sitting at home with
the computer switched on, but during the game it is never easy.} Be8 19. Bg5 f6
$2 (19... Qc5 {was relatively better, but after} 20. Qh4 {With the idea of Be7,
the margin of error for Black keeps getting smaller and smaller.}) 20. exf6 {
White now has a very strong attack. Black's pieces are unco-ordinated and this
results in a quick win.} Qc5 (20... Qf7 {was better.}) 21. Rxe6 Qf5 22. Re5
Qb1+ 23. Kh2 gxh5 (23... c5 24. Rde4 Bc6 25. hxg6 Bxe4 26. f7+ Kg7 27. Qh4 $18)
24. Bh6+ Bg6 25. Bxf8 Rxf8 26. Qg5 Qxa2 27. Re7 Qxf2 28. Rg7+ Kh8 29. Rxg6 {
With this game Veselin proved that Mihail Tal wasn't wrong when he said, "You
must take your opponent into a deep dark forest, where 2+2=5, and the path
leading out is only wide enough for one!} (29. Rxg6 hxg6 30. Qh6+ Kg8 31. Qg7#)
