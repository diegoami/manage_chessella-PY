O-O 9. Re1 $5 {According to the databases, this is the 6th most popular move
in the position! The idea is very subtle - White wants to get his knight from
b3-d2-f1-e3 and control the d5 square.} Be6 10. Be3 Nbd7 11. a4 Rc8 12. Bf3 {
Before moving the knight from b3, White controls the d5 square, so the d6-d5
is not easily possible.} Re8 $6 {I don't really like this move. The idea is to
put the knight on f8, but the knight is not so well placed there.} 13. a5 Qc7 (
