moment many of us were excited about the possible victory of the young star
Divya Deshmukh. It was nicely calculated by her that Nxb7 does not work.} 14.

position is very weak, 5 pieces in first rank and most of the black pieces are
active.} 17. Bxc6 (17. Qxc5 $2 Nf3+ 18. Kh1 Nxe1 19. Nc3 Re8 $19) 17... Qb6 18.

but gives White to opportunity to come back in the game.} (14... Bg4 $1 15. Qd2
Nf3+ 16. Bxf3 Qxd2 17. Bxd2 Bxf3 $17 {Now the double bishops, the weakness in
the white squares and the pawn up make the black game flow naturally.}) 15. Be5

changes were required, a more appropriate continuation was:} (15... Nxc3 16.

advantage with Nxb7 or the strong line:} (16. Bxd5 Bxd5 (16... Bxa5 $2 17. Qxd4

exchange will be a success in the black position.}) 22. Qe2 $2 {Very delicate
position, white had to find the most exact square for the Queen, otherwise
there is a risk of getting worse.} (22. Qf3 {This was the most flexible square,
from here the Queen does not give time to the black rooks to activate, also is
always looking at f6, forcing the Black Queen to remain vigilant.} Rbd8 23. h4

extremely strong and the quality could well be because of fatigue or pressure.}
