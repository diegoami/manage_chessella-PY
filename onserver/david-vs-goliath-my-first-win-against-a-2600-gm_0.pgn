{This game is an example of how not to get intimidated by a really strong
opposition and at the same time how we should always try to improve our
position bit by bit. When all the small advantages unite we get a big
advantage.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 b6 4. Nc3 Bb7 5. a3 d5 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. e3
{This has proved to be quite a toothless line after Black replies g6, but that
is where my knowledge ended.} g6 8. Bb5+ c6 9. Bd3 Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. Nxd5 $6
exd5 {If he wanted to take on d5 then he should have played Bd3 directly,
without Bb5+. Why give a check and force me to play c6 when that is the move I
have to make anyway! !} 12. b4 a5 $1 13. Bb2 Nd7 14. Qc2 Qe7 15. Bc3 axb4 16.
axb4 Rfc8 17. Qb2 Qf8 18. Nd2 Rxa1 19. Rxa1 Ra8 20. Rc1 $6 {Surrendering the
a-file to me. Here I was very much tempted by the idea to go f5-f4, but later
decided it would be too exposing and just simply doubled on the a-file.} Ra4
21. Bc2 Ra7 22. Bb1 Qa8 23. h3 Ba6 $1 {Improving my bishop. Throughout the game
I tried to improve my pieces, and it finally led to a big advantage.} 24. Bc2
Bb5 25. e4 Nf6 $1 26. e5 Nh5 27. g3 Bh6 28. Re1 Ra2 29. Qb1 Qa3 30. Nb3 { Now
Ng7 followed by Ne6 would have given me a nice position where he would have no
counterplay, but I went in for Bc4, not seeing my opponent's excellent
counterstroke.} Bc4 31. e6 $1 Ng7 (31... fxe6 32. Bxg6 hxg6 (32... Qxb3 33.
Bxh7+) 33. Qxg6+ Ng7 34. Rxe6 Qa8 35. Qxh6 Bxb3 36. Rxc6 {and the position is
unclear.}) 32. e7 Ne8 33. Bd2 $2 (33. Bd1 {and White should have a small
advantage. But I think my opponent touched the wrong B.}) 33... Bxb3 34. Bxg6
hxg6 (34... Bxd2 {would have won even more quickly.}) 35. Bxh6 Bc2 36. Qc1 Qxc1
37. Bxc1 Bd3 38. Be3 f6 39. g4 Rb2 40. Kg2 Rb1 41. Bc1 Kf7 {and he resigned. My
first win against 2600+ GM.} 0-1
