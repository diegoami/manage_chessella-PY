O-O 9. h3 Nb8 10. d4 Nbd7 {For a player like Carlsen, who rarely banks on the
opening, the Breyer variation must be an optimal choice. Black retains a
flexible position and things cannot go really wrong for him. In the worst case,
he would find himself in a slightly inferior position after 15-20 moves or so,
but Carlsen is quite good at converting such worse positions into... wins! The
important thing is to leave the opening behind with the minimum of damage and
then get to the complicated middlegame business, clearly Carlsen's piece of
cake.} 11. Nbd2 Bb7 12. Bc2 Re8 13. a4 Bf8 14. Bd3 c6 {A typical position for
this line. Black surely is flexible and has no weaknesses at all. He still has
useful moves at his disposal, mainly ...g6 and ...Bg7, but then will have to
come up with some counterplay in the centre.  White has better control in the
centre, but in order to prove at least a slight advantage, he has to prepare
against Black's ...d6-d5, ...c6-c5 and ...exd4 in optimal way. Easier said
than done, especially in over the board conditions.} 15. Qc2 {A relatively
rare move.} ({Carlsen has had some experience against the more popular
