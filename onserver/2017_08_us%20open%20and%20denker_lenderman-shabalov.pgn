1. c4 g6 {I was hoping to be the first one to surprise Shabalov with 1.c4,
since I play 1.d4 more frequently, but in fact Shabalov surprised me first
with 1...g6.} 2. g3 $5 {Normally I would play 2.d4 here automatically, but
every time I played Shabalov in the past, he's had some nasty surprise in
store for me, with good practical value, at least for one game, so this time I
wanted to have none of that, and just play a chess game where we both are sort
of on our own.} Bg7 3. Bg2 e6 {A very interesting hybrid, which strong GM
Vladimir Malakhov uses quite frequently in his games, especially against
lower-rated players. Black's idea is to play Ne7, d5 and develop harmony that
way. This setup is pretty logical here, since I haven't played d4 yet, and
can't have a huge advantage in the center. A stem game to study, of what can
happen if White gets control of the center, can be a recent one between the young
Russian Andrey Esipenko and the USA's Ruifeng Li, in the recently passed Match of
the Millennials.} 4. Nf3 d5 5. O-O Ne7 6. d4 O-O 7. Qc2 b6 8. Rd1 {I didn't want
to take on d5 yet, since I didn't want to give Black an additional option with
Bf5.} (8. cxd5 exd5 9. Nc3 Bf5) 8... Bb7 9. cxd5 exd5 {Black has to go for
this structure because otherwise I get a stong center with e4.} 10. b3 {
Here I wasn't sure what the best setup for me is.} a5 11. Nc3 Na6 12. Bb2 Nb4
13. Qd2 Nf5 14. a3 {Actually I didn't particularly want to play this move,
since I thought in the long run that weakens my pawn structure. However, I
felt like that knight on b4 had to go.} (14. Rac1 {I wanted to play this first,
but I didn't play this because of a concrete reason.} Ba6 {And now I was
worried that it's hard to meet the Bh6 threat. However, it turned out I was
afraid of ghosts.} 15. Ne5 (15. g4 $5) 15... Bh6 (15... c5 16. Nxd5 $1 Nxd5 17.
dxc5 $18) 16. f4 {And I'm just much better. Black is now poorly coordinated.
It's hard for him to defend d5.} (16. e3 f6 $2 17. Nc6 {Also works.}) 16... Bb7

Qe7 17. Rac1 Rad8 18. Ne2 {Perhaps this isn't the most accurate move.} (18. Ne5
{I didn't like this because of c5 with counterplay. However, I could've
improved on this idea.} c5) (18. Bh3 $1 Nd6 19. Ne5 {And only now Ne5, and now
it's slightly awkward for him, and it's not so easy for him to get c5 in
comfortably.} c5 (19... f6 20. Nd3 $14) 20. dxc5) 18... c5 19. Nf4 {Here I had
lots of choices, but here I used psychology to play this move, and it worked! :
)} c4 $2 (19... cxd4 {Of course I expected this move. But Shabalov is an
aggressive player, and really dislikes playing symmetrical positions without
much going on, especially if there is a little bit of suffering. Plus, I knew
he really needed the win to keep his US Open hopes alive, since his tiebreaks
were bad thanks to earlier draws, so 7.5 for him would never be sufficient.}
20. exd4 {I was thinking to play this, thinking I was slightly better. I
misevaluated this, though, since I don't get in Ne5, and he has a strong move,
Bh6, after which only Black can be better.} (20. Nxd4 Nxd4 21. Bxd4 {I didn't
think this was good enough for anything in the meanwhile.} (21. exd4 Bh6) 21...
Bxd4 22. Rxd4 Qxa3 {I didn't think I can be better here. The problem is, Rc8 is a
huge threat.} 23. Qd1 Rc8 $11) 20... Bh6 $1) 20. Ne5 (20. bxc4 dxc4 21. d5 {
Even this would be enough for a huge advantage.} c3 22. Bxc3 Rc8 23. Qb2) 20...
b5 (20... f6 21. Nexg6 hxg6 22. Nxg6 Qd7 23. bxc4 $36 {I saw this line and I
thought I have a huge initiative here, and indeed that's true.}) 21. bxc4 bxc4
(21... dxc4 22. Nc6 Bxc6 23. Bxc6 {is hopeless for Black.}) 22. Bc3 {Probably
more precise than Qa4 because...} (22. Qa4 Bxe5 23. dxe5 Nc5 {I thought gives
Black more practical chances.}) 22... Qxa3 23. Nxc4 {I thought a while here,
but still ended up making the wrong dynamic choice.} (23. Ra1 {This was better.
} Qe7 (23... Qd6 24. Rxa5 Nc7 25. Rb1 $16 {This is bad for Black. My pieces
are too active and his pieces are in awkward spots.}) 24. Rxa5 Bxe5 25. dxe5
Nc7 26. Ra7 $18 {and I'm just winning.}) 23... dxc4 24. Bxb7 Nb4 25. Bxb4 {
I couldn't help being materialistic. I thought this was simplest, but maybe
not objectively best.} (25. Qd2 {Originally I thought this was best, but I
missed the sneaky move, Na2! which gives some practical chances still.} Na2 26.
Ra1 Qxc3 27. Rxa2 $16 {is better for me, but I thought the other way was
cleaner.}) 25... axb4 26. Qxc4 (26. Ra1 {would be a mistake because of a nice
shot, which thankfully I saw.} Nxe3 $1 27. fxe3 Qxe3+ 28. Kg2 Rxd4 $11 {
with a roughly equal game suddenly.}) 26... Nd6 27. Qa6 Nxb7 28. Qxb7 Rb8 29.
Qd5 (29. Qc6 b3) 29... Red8 30. Qe4 b3 31. Ra1 Qd6 (31... Qb2 {I expected this
or Qb4, trying to keep the queen in closer contact with the passed pawn. White
is better, but it's still not so easy to convert.}) 32. Rab1 Rb5 33. Rb2 {
Now my plan is simply to try to win the pawn on b3.} Bf8 34. Rdb1 Qb6 35. Qd3
Rb8 36. Ra1 {Stopping Ba3.} Qb7 37. Ne2 h5 38. h4 {Stopping any counterplay.}
Bd6 $6 {This is time pressure inaccuracy. It only helps me.} (38... g5 39. Nc3
{Doesn't work for Black.}) (38... Rb6) (38... Qf3 $16) 39. Nc3 Rb6 40. Ne4 Qe7
41. Rab1 Bc7 (41... Ba3 42. Rxb3 Rxb3 43. Rxb3 Rxb3 44. Qxb3 Qxe4 45. Qxa3 $18
{Is a hopeless endgame for Black. I consolidate no matter what Black tries.}
Qb1+ (45... g5 46. Qc5 $18) 46. Kh2 Qc2 47. Qa8+ Kg7 48. Qf3) 42. Ng5 {I
thought it's simplest to not allow any g5 counterplay.} Qb4 (42... Qa3 43. Qc4
{Is the point. This fork on c7 and f7 is deadly for black.}) 43. Rxb3 {And
black resigned since after Qxb3 Rxb3 Rxb3, Qc4 forks c7 and f7. A very
important win for me, and especially nice since I thought it was a decent game
for me against a great fighter like Shabalov, who has given me a very hard
time in the last few decisive games we've played :)} 1-0
