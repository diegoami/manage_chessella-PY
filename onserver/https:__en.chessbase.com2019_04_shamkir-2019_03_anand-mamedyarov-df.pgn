Bc4 Bc5 {It is worth elaborating at least once on the differences between this
move and ...Nf6. The text allows the sideline with c3 and d4, as well as 
(incidentally) the Evans Gambit. It also commits to playing ...d6 rather than .
..d5, at least initially. However, it does not allow Ng5- which is still, well
into the 21st century, a genuine try for an advantage.} 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 (5. d4

lines, but it was defanged a while ago.}) 5... d6 6. c3 a6 7. a4 Ba7 8. Na3 Ne7
{This move isn't geared so much towards a kingside attack- those tend to need .
..g5 in the mix to be successful- but rather towards the simple ...c6, ...f5
plan.} (8... h6 {is more common, with the idea being that after} 9. Nc2 O-O {
Black is prepared to play ...Be6 next, and White lacks an obvious continuation
that isn't} 10. Be3 Bxe3 11. Nxe3 Be6 12. Bxe6 fxe6 $11 {Adams,M-Eljanov,P

to get ...d5 without fuss. The position being basically equal, there wasn't a
whole lot that could be done, but one interesting option is suggested.} ({
The unstereotyped} 12. Nd2 $5 {merited attention, to try and leave Black with
an isolated d-pawn in the event of ...d5.} c6 (12... Bd7 13. a5 Nf4 14. Re1 Qe7

The knight returns. There was little prospect of a kingside attack and the
c-file needs guarding.} 17. Nf3 Nc6 $11 {Black seems fine, if only because of
the b4-square.}) 12... c6 13. a5 (13. d4 exd4 14. cxd4 {is still technically
possible but White's pieces are quite vulnerable to tactics after} Re8 15. Ng5

was more comfortable, but hindsight is a wonderful thing. Black could think
about ...Ng4 soon.}) 15. exd5 cxd5 (15... Nxd5 {tends to lead to better static

stabilised. Black has reasonable chances, but he has to act quite quickly, or
else the static disadvantages of his position (the b7- and d5-pawns) will tell
sooner or later.} Bd7 $1 (20... Ne4 {with the intention of ...f5 is another
way to go; White should probably then break with} 21. c4 dxc4 22. Nxc4 Bxc4 23.

ambitious regrouping is to attack the d5-pawn as many times as possible.} (22.

well.} (22... b5 $5 {was a slightly odd option that probably didn't occur to
either player: after} 23. axb6 Qxb6 24. Nd2 Bc6 {Black obtains counterplay
with ...Re6, ...Rb8 and probably ...a5-a4.}) 23. Nc2 Rfe8 24. Nb4 Bb5 25. Rxe7

stands worse, and abandons ship. Thus, seemingly without making huge errors he
ends up in a lost position.} (26. Re1 Rxe1+ 27. Nxe1 Ne7 $15 {was consistent,
when despite White's significant pressure on d5 and much 'better' bishop, it
is his position which is at greater risk of crumbling as a result of some
simple move like ...Qd8.}) 26... h5 27. Qh3 Bd7 28. Qg2 Bb5 29. Qh3 h4 30. Bc2

also needs to worry about being worse.} (35... N6h5 $19 {was called for, when
White is practically in zugzwang.}) 36. Bxe4 dxe4 37. Ne5 Nd3 38. Qh8+ {
After Petrosian.} Kxh8 39. Nxf7+ Kh7 40. Nxd6 Bd7 $2 {An unfortunate move-40

knights and is completely winning.} (41... Nxb4 42. Nf6+ Kg7 43. Nxd7 Nd3 44.

safety are enough only to recover one of the two pawns.}) 42. Ng5+ Kh6 43. Nxd3
