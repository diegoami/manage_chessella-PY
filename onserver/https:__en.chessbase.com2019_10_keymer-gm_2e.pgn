tournament Ganguly tried this typical Najdorf move against Magnus Carlsen -
and lost.}) 7. g4 Nfd7 {On the day of the game this move had already occurred
in more than 300 games of the ChessBase Online Database. On top level

will to fight.} f6 $6 {A surprising concept that gives Black some grief.
Usually, Black does not want to weaken the kingside where White attacks him.} (

status quo and protects the f-pawn from being attacked after the opening of
the f-file.}) 18... hxg6 19. f4 Bg4 20. Bh3 $5 {Apparently, Saric was in
attacking mode.} Bxh3 ({The position after} 20... Bxd1 21. Qxd1 f5 $5 22. h5 $5
