point when Ris presented the position I asked myself what I wanted to do if I
was White.  Obviously the move which comes immediately to mind, and the one
mistakenly played by Ris is Ng5, because one wants to give checkmate on H7.
But as soon as I saw Qh5, I understood Ng5 wasn't working. The next question
which popped in my mind was: How do I deflect the Qe2 on a diagonal or square
where it can't come back to protect H7? And if you ask yourself this question,
you immediately will see the right move to play.} 27. Ng5 $4 Qh5 28. Rd7 $4 $19
