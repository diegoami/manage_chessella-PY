the idea belongs to Moscow GM Vadim Zvjaginsev, and since 2016 it has been
played by many, notably Gelfand a few times. Even Magnus Carlsen tried it.} (

whole variation is not that well explored yet, so it's possible to confuse
over-the-board inspiration with home prep.} ({Gelfand faced} 12. Bd4 {three
times in recent practice and scored 1/3. I don't know how valuable this data
is.}) 12... Nbxd5 13. O-O-O Bd7 $6 (13... Qe7 {seemed more logical.}) 14. Nxd5
