1. c4 c5 2. Nc3 g6 3. g3 Nc6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. Nf3 e6 6. h4  Nf6 {This is certainly
a curiosity, and prior to So, no GM had ventured to play this. Most have chosen
6...h6, so as to simply shut down White's ideas with g5 after h5. The fact is
that White's king is no less vulnerable than Black's since the positon is a
near mirror, and neither side has castled. I prefer Wei Yi's choice against
Adams, which follows Nimzowitsch's precept: when attacked on the wing without
proper justification, the best reply is a counter in the center.} (6... d5 7.

{[#]} 30. Ra7 $2 {The idea of moving the pieces to capture the a-pawn is right,
but the execution is wrong. Black will force White to exchange his queen in a
very unfavorable situation, or just lose his h6 pawn as a result.} (30. Qc4 $1
$18 {was the correct continuation. The difference is that now if Black plays}
Qf4 {, as in the game, to capture h6, it runs into a serious little problem: it
would lose the bishop!} 31. Qxa4 Qxh6 32. Ra7 $1 { and the bishop has nowhere
to run to!}) 30... e5 31. Rxa4 Qf4 32. Qe3 Qxe3 33. fxe3 {Now things are very
different. White's pawns are shattered and he has three pawn islands to Black's
one.} Rc8 34. Ra5 Kf8 35. Kg3 Bc6 36. c4 Bd7 37. Be2 Be6 38. Rxe5 Bxc4 39. Bxc4
