1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. h4 {The popularity of a quick h4
in the anti-Grunfeld is increasing rapidly. The reason is that with Black's
setup it is not so easy to punish such a side attack which also has strong
positional foundations.} Bg7 6. h5 Nc6 7. g3 Bg4 8. h6 {Here is one of the many
points. The bishop on g7 is lost sooner or later as it will not be safe on f6
(Ne4 could come soon).} Bxc3 9. dxc3 Qd6 (9... Bxf3 10. exf3 {might be your
computer's recommendation, but giving up two bishops seems very strange.}) 10.
Bg2 O-O-O 11. Ng5 $5 (11. Qa4 {was played against Wei Yi just last month.} Qe6
12. O-O f6 $13 {Wang Yue-Wei Yi, Chinese League 2015.}) 11... Ne5 {there is no
other good way of defending f7.} 12. Qa4 Nb6 (12... f6 13. Nf7 Nxf7 14. Qxg4+
{gives White the pair of bishops against two knights, but Black is pretty
active. It's an unclear position.}) 13. Qd4 $1 f6 (13... Qxd4 14. cxd4 Rxd4
{leaves White plenty of interesting options here, but personally I like} 15. b3
$1 {when Black's pieces on the long diagonal are very badly placed.}) 14. Bf4
$1 Qxd4 15. cxd4 Nc6 $1 {An exchange sacrifice that changes the character of
the position.} (15... Rxd4 16. Bxe5 fxe5 {is not pleasant to defend. Black's up
a pawn for now but his structure is just terrible.}) 16. Nf7 Nxd4 17. Rc1 e5
18. Rh4 $1 {Very precise. Otherwise Black gets a nice initiative:} exf4 19.
Nxd8 $2 (19. Rxg4 $1 f3 20. Bf1 $1 Rhe8 21. Nxd8 Nxe2 22. Bxe2 Rxe2+ 23. Kf1
Kxd8 24. Rf4 {and Black doesn't quite have enough here.} Rxb2 $6 25. Rxf6 $18)
19... f3 $1 20. exf3 Nxf3+ 21. Bxf3 Re8+ 22. Kd2 Bxf3 { Black's still down the
exchange, but White's knight on d8 feels very isolated from the rest of White's
pieces.} 23. Nf7 Bc6 $6 {Missing an excellent chance to win with Black.} (23...
Re2+ $1 24. Kd3 Re7 25. Nd6+ (25. Nh8 g5 $17) 25... Kd8 {the key difference is
that with the king on d3 there is a skewer on e2 no matter where the king
goes.}) (23... Re7 $2 24. Nd6+ $14) 24. b4 a6 25. a4 $1 Nxa4 26. Re1 Nb6 27.

$16) 28. Re7 $1 Nd5 29. Nd6+ $1 cxd6 30. Rxh7 g5 { White's down a lot of
material, but his h-pawn is very dangerous.} 31. Re4 Rg6 $6 (31... Nc7 32. Ree7
Ne8 {and I don't see how to make progress for either isde. For example:} 33.

after} 38. Rg7 Be4 39. Re7 Bxh7 40. Rhxh7 $18) 36. h7 Rh6 37. Rxg4 Ne7 38. Rg7
