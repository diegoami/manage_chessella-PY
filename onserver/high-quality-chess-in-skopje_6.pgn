has been seen in already eleven games before, Pelletier comes up with an
interesting novelty.} 13. axb6 $5 {Sacrificing a piece in order to open up
lines on the queenside and win some pawns.} Rxa3 14. Nb5 Ra5 (14... Ra8 {could
be an improvement so that later Nb3 doesn't win a tempo.} 15. Nxc7 (15. bxc7

Rb1 Rd8 {The position remains complex but Black is definitely not worse.}) 15.
bxc7 Qd7 16. a4 {Somehow it is much easier to play as White. He has to just go
Nb3 and keep pushing his pawns.} Ba6 17. Nb3 Bxb5 18. cxb5 Qxc7 (18... Raa8 19.
b6 $18 {and with a5 coming up, it would have been a complete massacre!}) 19.
Nxa5 Qxa5 20. g3 Nxe2+ 21. Qxe2 {Although Black has two pieces for the rook I
already like White's position as his two queenside pawns combined with open
c-file for the rook should be good enough for a clear advantage.} Bh6 {
controlling the crucial c1 square.} 22. Rfb1 Rb8 23. b6 $1 {Pelletier knows
that he only has to queen one of the pawns!} Rxb6 24. Rxb6 Qxb6 25. a5 Qc5 26.

Pelletier.} 1-0
