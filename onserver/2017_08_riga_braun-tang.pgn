knights which is in general good news for black} 8. Nf3 Ne4 9. Nd2 {White has
to waste a tempo, otherwise ...Bb4 or ...Bf5 would excert pressure on the
constellation Qc2, Nc3, Ke1.} (9. Bd2 Nxd2 10. Nxd2 g6 11. e3 Bf5 12. Bd3 Bxd3

white king will have to castle long afterwards. Maybe already a mistake, as
Arik Braun told me after the game. He underestimated the black attacking
potential while dreaming of getting an advantage on the king side.} (12. Bd3

the opening. Black is completely fine.}) 12... Be6 13. O-O-O (13. Bd3 {is
possibly more sensitive. Would black choose} b5 $2 {White could exploit not
having castled yet and bring the king towards the kingside.} ({However, after}

castling long.}) 14. O-O $16 {[%csl Rc6]}) 13... b5 $1 {the weakness on c6
does not count, as Tang will show in the game! In the next moves the game will
continue as expected: Braun regropus his Nc3 while Tang pushes his pawns on
the queenside} 14. Kb1 b4 15. Ne2 Nd7 16. Nc1 Qb6 17. Nd3 a5 18. Rc1 Rfc8 19.

should have been chosen by Braun. After the text move, the white position
becomes very dangerous. However, refusing the draw by playing} c5 $1 {would
have been strong.}) 22... c5 23. dxc5 Nxc5 24. Nxc5 Bxc5 25. Bd3 a3 26. b3 {
[%cal Gf4e5,Ge5d4] the problem for white is, that his Bishop on f4 can't join
the defense as he has to protect the pawn on e3.} d4 27. exd4 Bxd4 28. Be4 Bb2

weak king?} 29. Bxa8 Bxc1 30. Rxc1 Rxa8 31. Rd1 h5 32. Be5 f6 33. Bd4 $6 (33.
