{In this game I will avoid commenting too much about the opening as it is all
well known and many games have been played in this line. But the middlegame and
the late endgame are particularly interesting.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4.

12. O-O Qc8 13. Rb1 axb4 14. axb4 Bxd3 15. Qxd3 Qb7 {This position has been
reached, just 15 days ago in the game of Sargissian with the black pieces
against Ding Liren. Sargissian is one of Levon's second and we can be sure that
he prepared this line with him.} 16. Rfc1 {This same position with a different
move order was already played by Aronian against Nakamura from the white side
in the Zurich Chess Challenge 2016.} Rfc8 17. Ne1 $146 {Giri's novelty, not an
earth shattering one but just improving his f3 knight.} Bd8 18. Qd1 Bc7 19. Nd3
Bxf4 20. exf4 Ne4 21. Ne2 Ra2 22. Rc2 {As Anish mentioned after the game, Black
is comfortable here. He should only be careful not to allow b4-b5. Aronian does
not prevent it and after that he is under grave pressure.} Rca8 $6 23. f3 Rxc2
24. Qxc2 Nef6 25. b5 $1 Rc8 (25... bxc5 26. dxc5 cxb5 27. Nd4 $36 (27. c6 Qb6+
$11)) 26. Qa4 $1 {An extremely strong move by Anish who threatens to play his
queen to a6 here. This idea was missed by Levon. Anish mentions that he found
this idea after much deliberation and his thoughts were mainly concerned with
breaking on the kingside with f5. But when that didn't work he turned his
attention on the other wing and found this idea. } Qc7 (26... bxc5 27. dxc5
cxb5 28. Rxb5 Qc7 29. Nd4 $16) (26... cxb5 27. Qxb5 $16 {It is not at all easy
for Black to untangle.}) 27. bxc6 Qxc6 28. Qxc6 Rxc6 {[#] White has a way out.}
29. Rc1 (29. Nb4 Rc7 30. c6 Nb8 31. Nc3 $1 {The absolute star move and hats off
to Aronian for having seen this for his opponent. It just shows how good these
guys are, always looking out for opponent's threats.} (31. Ra1 Nxc6 32. Rc1

Nxc6 $16 {The knight comes to e5. The position might not be 100% lost, but it
is really unpleasant to be black here.}) 29... Rc7 (29... Rc8 30. c6 Nb8 31.
Nb4 Ne8 32. f5 $1 {Once again Aronian suggested this move. One gets the feeling
that the Armenian wanted to get up from the board and switch sides! He was
seeing some really excellent winning resources for his opponent.} Nd6 33. fxe6

computer shows an excellent defensive resource for Black.} Nfd7 $3 {Even 2800
players can miss such moves!} (32... Nxd3 33. Rxc7 Nxf4 34. Nd6 d4 35. Rc8+ Kh7

Rc8 33. Kf2 Nc7 34. Nxc7 Rxc7 35. Ke3 {White is better here, but Black can
cling on by quickly bringing his king to the center.} Kf8 36. Kd4 (36. f5 $5)
36... Nb8 $1 {A nice move by Levon. Suddenly it is not easy to make progress.}
37. Nb4 Rb7 38. Kc3 Ke7 39. Ra1 Kd7 40. Nd3 f6 {Aronian offered a draw at this
point, but Giri saw that he will always have some chances with the f5 break or
the kingside pawn storm and hence decided to continue the battle.} 41. Ra8 Kc6

players was} 49... Re8 50. Ra6 Nxb4 51. Rb6+ Kc7 52. Kxb4 Rb8 53. Kb5 {Both the
players thought this was lost for Black, but as always the computer begs to
differ!} Kc8 $1 {A passive, backward retreating and a difficult move for humans
to see.} (53... e5 { Aronian and Giri showed this line and this is really
nice.} 54. Rxb8 Kxb8 55. Kc6 $1 d4 56. Kd7 $18) 54. Rxb8+ (54. Kc6 $2 Rxb6+ 55.

draw.}) 50. Ra6 (50. Nxc6 Kxc6 51. Ra6+ Kxc5 52. Rxe6 g4 $1 {A key point that
had to be seen beforehand.} 53. fxg4 Rf2 $11) 50... Nxb4 51. Rb6+ Kc8 (51...

An entire chapter on how to keep pressing your opponent and finding small
nuances in simplified positions can be written on this very game.} 1/2-1/2
