g5 16. Nf3 dxc3 17. bxc3 f5 18. exf6 Qxf6 19. O-O {All played instantly by
Aman, while Justin has been using up buckets of time. This doesn't bode well
for the youngster.} Bg7 20. Bb5 {So far Justin has defended remarkably well,
but with little time he makes a couple hasty pawn pushes and allows White to
break through spectacularly.} e5 (20... Bd7 {and while White's position would
be my preference, it still isn't so easy to break through.}) 21. Rad1 e4 22.
Nxg5 Ne7 23. Nxe4 $1 dxe4 {[#]} 24. h6 $1 {This spectacular diversion
completely discoordinates Black.} Bxh6 25. Bc4+ Kh8 26. Rd6 Qg7 27. Rxh6 { The
rook is immune to capture due to the diagonal check.} Bf5 28. Rd6 {Black's
position is in ruins and he still has no time on the clock. He fights
admirably, but there isn't much he can do.} Ng6 29. Bd5 Rae8 30. Bc6 Re7 31.
Rd4 Rc8 32. Qh5 Qf6 33. Rd6 Re6 34. Rd7 Nf8 (34... Ne5 {was perhaps a missed
chance, but White should still preserve his edge with} 35. Ba4) 35. Rf7 Qg6 36.

Justin Wang, as he is bound to be a force to be reckoned with in coming years.}
