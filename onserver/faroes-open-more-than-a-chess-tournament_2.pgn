b5 8. Nxc6 Qxc6 (8... dxc6 {was another possibility, but seems a lot less
lively.}) 9. Bd3 Bb7 10. Qg4 {I had got a nice, new position after 10 moves,
but the cost was 47 minutes (more than half) of time already spent. I had 43
minutes for the remaining 30 moves. My opponent on the other hand, had 87
minutes remaining here.} h5 11. Qg5 Ne7 12. a4 b4 13. Ne2 Ng6 14. h4 {I was
playing much faster around this point, but the position was quite complex and
clearly demanded more time for accuracy.} Qc7 15. f4 Be7 16. Qg3 Rc8 (16... Qd8
