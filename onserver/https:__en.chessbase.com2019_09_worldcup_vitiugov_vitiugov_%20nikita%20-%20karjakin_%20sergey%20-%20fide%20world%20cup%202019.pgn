Nc4 Re8 9. Bd2 b5 10. Ne3 Nf8 11. h4 {This has been seen before in
Duda-Laznicka, 2016. The question is, what is the point of this move? Well,
for starters Ng6 is now longer so comfortable because I can stop Nf4 with g3
and then push the knight back with h5. But mainly the h-pawn lunge is to move
ahead with h5-h6 and create weaknesses around the black king.} (11. O-O-O a5

11... a5 (11... Ng6 12. g3) 12. a4 $5 {But this is already a new concept.
White players have usually tried to long castle and continue with their play
on the kingside which leads to double edged play. What Vitiugov is trying to
do, is play on the entire board. The downside of this strategy is that he
doesn't know where he should be placing his king.} Bb6 {Karjakin defends his
a5 pawn, asking the question to White - what are you going to do with your
king?} (12... b4 {should be considered. It doesn't seem idea to give up the c4
square but this is not a big worry for Black, he can always exchange that
knight with his light squared bishop.} 13. Nc4 f6 14. h5 Ne6 $13) 13. h5 $1 {
Let's keep moving forward.} Ne6 (13... h6 {Judging from how the game proceeded,
this might be a wiser choice, stopping White from creating weaknesses on the
kingside.} 14. g4 $5 Bxe3 15. Qxe3 Bxg4 16. Rg1 Bxf3 17. Qxf3 Qd6 {Black is a
pawn up, but I am pretty sure that Vitiugov analyzed this position at home and
came to the conclusion that White has excellent chances.} 18. O-O-O $44) 14.

Karjakin.} (16... exd4 {This looked like a serious option during the game.} 17.

positionally quite favourable for White.} Qe7 21. f3 Bxe4 22. dxe4 $1 $16) 18.

that this is much better than what happened in the game.}) 17. axb5 cxb5 18.

21. exf5 Bxf5 {Here we reach another critical position. White has his trumps
in the position, the main one being the excellent pawn structure and the
little guy on h6 which constantly creates mating threats against the black
king.} 22. Qb7 (22. O-O $14 {This was the risk free way of playing the
position.}) 22... Re7 (22... Qd7 23. Qxd7 (23. Qxb6 e4 $132) 23... Bxd7 24. f3

position. However after} 24. O-O $1 {The threat of Bg5 forces Black to make
some decisions.} (24. Bg5 $2 exd3+ {is just what Black wants.} 25. Bxe7 Qxe7+

pieces have created a lot of positional weaknesses in Black's camp, it is time
now to bring the king to safety!} Qe8 26. Rae1 Bc6 27. Qa2 Qf7 28. Re3 Rae8 29.
Rfe1 R6e7 {I think such positions are Vitiugov's strength. There are
weaknesses in the position, he manoeuvres with precision, putting more
pressure on his opponent.} 30. b3 b4 31. Qa1 Qf6 32. R1e2 $1 Bd5 33. Qe1 {
Forming Alekhine's Gun!} Re6 34. Bc1 $1 {The bishop makes his way to b2. The
only downside is that the h6 pawn is weak, but e5 is definitely more important.

better for White on two counts: 1. The black king is weaker than White's king
and 2. the black pawns are weaker than white's. The opposite coloured bishop
with the queens on the board, adds to Black's worry rather than increase the
drawing tendencies.} a4 45. Bc5 Qd5 46. f3 axb3 (46... a3 47. Bxb4 a2 48. Bc3

Qb8+ followed by either winning the c6 bishop or mating the black king.} Qf7

to play Qc5+ now and pick up the bishop on c6. Karjakin deals with this threat
but forgets about the other threat!} (52. Qc5+ Qe7 53. Qxc6 Qe1+ 54. Kh2 Qh4+
