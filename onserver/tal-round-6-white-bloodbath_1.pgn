{It was truly surprising how easily Li Chao got in trouble today against
Svidler.} 1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 d4 3. b4 Bg4 4. Qb3 Nf6 5. g3 a5 6. b5 a4 7. Qd3 Bxf3
8. Qxf3 c6 {Over the past few moves, Black has foced White to play b4-b5 and
threaten the structure on the queenside, while giving up his bishop on the
light squares. This seems very unnatural to me, he is not even going to be able
to exploit the c5 square properly.} 9. Bg2 e5 10. O-O Be7 11. d3 O-O 12. Nd2 h5
13. h3 g6 14. Rb1 {Svidler has only made natural moves. Now his pressure on the
queenside is very considerable. Black has problems even developing.} Nh7 15. e3
{Black was threatening Ng5 trapping the queen, and the break on the center
seems natural.} Re8 16. exd4 exd4 17. Re1 h4 18. bxc6 bxc6 19. Rb7 {White's
advantage might already be winning. Notice the difference in power between both
sides.} hxg3 20. fxg3 {Black has opened up the kingside, but perhaps this only
helped White! Now the f-file is open.} Bf6 (20... Nd7 $1 21. Qxc6 (21. Ne4 $1
$16) 21... Nc5 22. Qxe8+ Qxe8 23. Rbxe7 Qb8 {is not 100% clear yet}) 21. Ne4
Nd7 22. Rf1 {The game is just over from now. Svidler soon collects the c6 pawn
and his superior activity, his pair of bishops and simple technique reel in the
point home.} Rxe4 23. Qxe4 Nc5 24. Qxc6 Rc8 25. Qb5 Nxb7 26. Bxb7 Rc7 27. Bf4
