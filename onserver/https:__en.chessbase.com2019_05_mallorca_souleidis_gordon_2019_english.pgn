but he didn´t want to run into the lately fashioned move} 3. d4 {, but which
wasn´t my idea.}) 3. g3 {No open Sicilian and no transposition to the Najdorf.

occupational reasons in the past years he doesn´t follow the latest trends in
the chess world. This move was new to him, so he basically ran into a good
line for White.} d4 ({There are some games with} 7... exf5 8. Nxd5 {which
proved that White has an edge.}) 8. fxe6 $1 {This is the point. If Black

after a while as White developes another piece and controls the black squares
at the queenside so that Qb3 can be played without any problems.} (14. a4 {
