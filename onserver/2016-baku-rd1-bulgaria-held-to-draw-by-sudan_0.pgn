{This could easily be a master vs. amateur game. It is indeed one, however, in
this game the weaker player, Elo-wise, demonstrates great understanding and
beats a strong International Master.} 1. d4  Nf6  2. c4  e6  3. Nf3  b6 {51
Petrov decides to play it classical: A Queen's Indian ladies and gentlemen!} 4.
g3  Bb4+ {345 After a long thought. Presumably, Petrov wanted to win this game
and then he decided to choose something less common than the main line.} 5.
Nbd2 $1 {65 A great choice by Abdelazeez! The exclamation mark is not because
of this move's strength but it is for its psychological value! White will have
a very solid position and although this is not an ambitious continuation for
White, it definitely keeps White's position solid and avoids complications!}
(5. Bd2 c5 {is what probably Petrov was hoping for.}) 5... Ba6 {(376) Again,
after a long time for an opening move. Petrov is obviously not happy with his
choice of opening and he seeks some complications in which he may outplay his
lower-rated opponent. But this move does not offer many complications, so he
should have tried the following continuation if he wanted a very complicated
game:} (5... Bb7 6. Bg2 c5 7. d5 $1 exd5 8. Nh4 O-O 9. O-O Re8 {[#] Well, this

the plan with d6 and Nbd7 but the queen on e3 here does not do much for White.
Nevertheless, we cannot blame him because he is following exactly the same plan
demonstrated by the expert of this opening, GM Pavel Tregubov} (11. Rfd1 h6 12.

good move in this position. Now White wants to move his knight either to d2 or
g5 to capture the bishop on e4.} Bxf3  17. exf3 {11 Petrov decideds to defend
with two knights vs.two bishops.} Qc6  18. c5 $1 {542 Brilliant positional play

will capture f5 and then c5.} Rfe8  (18... bxc5 $2 19. Bxf5 exf5 20. dxc5 Qxc5

Probably shocked at how a player who is almost 300 Elo below him had outplayed
him in 20 moves. Petrov starts to stall and hope for a mistake by his opponent.
However, in my opinion this was a bad practical decision. Once a player is
capable of demonstrating such a great positional skill, procrastination would
only give him more time to increase his advantage, Petrov should have played
bxc5 to complicate matters.} (19... bxc5 20. bxc5 (20. dxc5 d4 {could have
