{Inspired by my DVD on the French Defense Jason decided to play it against
Michael Adams!} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. Bd3 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7.
Ne2 cxd4 8. cxd4 f6 9. exf6 Nxf6 10. O-O Bd6 11. Nf3 {Mickey plays a very well
known positional line of the French Tarrasch, hoping to achieve a small plus.}
Qc7 {Stopping Bf4.} 12. h3 $5 {This move is gaining in popularity recently, as
White hopes to cause Black some small problems. The idea is to establish a
Bishop on e3.} O-O 13. Be3 Bd7 14. Rc1 {The main move although Mickey has
previously played the 2nd option, Re1.} (14. Re1 Nb4 (14... Be8 $5 15. Ng5 Bf7
16. Rc1 h6 17. Nxf7 Qxf7 {Looks close to equal.}) 15. Bb1 a6 16. a3 Nc6 17. Bd3
Rac8 18. Rc1 Qb8 19. Qd2 b5 20. Rc2 a5 21. Rec1 $14 {1-0 (81) Adams,M (2742)
-Harika,D (2516) Douglas 2015}) 14... Be8 {A standard idea in the French
Tarrasch, rerouting the passive bishop.} 15. Qd2 (15. Ng5 {Is the main move.}
Qe7 16. f4 Nb4 17. Bb1 Ne4 $5 18. Nxe4 dxe4 19. Bxe4 Nxa2 20. Ra1 Nb4 {[%cal
Ge8c6] Feels like a satisfactory position for the second player.}) 15... Bh5
16. Ng5 Bxe2 $6 {Possibly the move that cost him the game....} (16... Qe7 17.
Ng3 Bxg3 18. fxg3 h6 19. Nf3 Ne4 $11) 17. Qxe2 Rae8 {There is an argument for
White to play Bb5 at some point soon in order to make the e5 break less
effective.} 18. Rfe1 Qd7 19. Nf3 a6 $1 {Stopping Bb5.} 20. a3 e5 $1 {Black is
trying hard to equalise, although White will have an enduring advantage due to
the Bishop for Knight on the open board and Black's isolated d pawn.} 21. dxe5
Nxe5 22. Nxe5 Bxe5 23. Qd2 d4 24. Bf4 Ng4 $5 25. Bxe5 Nxe5 26. Bf1 Rf6 (26...

g6 33. Qe1 (33. h4 $5) 33... Kg7 34. g3 Qd5 35. f4 $6 {This move feels a bit
unnecessary, weakening the King.} (35. h4 $14) 35... Rxe6 (35... Qb3 $1 36.
Rxf6 Rxf6 37. Qd2 Re6 {And White's advantage seems to be evaporating.}) 36.
Rxe6 Rf6 37. Re8 Qb3 $6 (37... Qd6 $11) 38. Qe2 $1 {With the White Rook away
from e2 this move holds together White's position nicely, defending d3 and b2
whilst controlling the e file. Black should probably consider centralising the
Queen again with Qd5, but it's hard to admit a mistake on the previous move.}
b4 39. Qc2 (39. axb4 $1 {This looks more accurate and may have led to a
beautiful checkmate.} Nxb4 40. Re7+ Rf7 $1 (40... Kh6 {[#]} 41. Qh5+ $3 gxh5

Inviting White's next move.} (40... bxa3 41. bxa3 h5 $14) 41. Bd3 bxa3 42. bxa3
a5 43. Ra8 Re6 44. Kf2 Kf6 45. Bb5 Rd6 $4 {Hastening the end by blundering a
piece. Black still had his work cut out as he was likely to lose a pawn. A
well played game from both sides without any major mistakes until the very end.
From the moment he played 16...Be2 Jason had a slightly worse position which
he never fully recovered from. In typical fashion Mickey ground down his
opponent.} 46. Ra6 1-0
