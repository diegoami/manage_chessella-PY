15. O-O Nd7 16. Rbd1 $5 (16. Kh1 {is almost universally played, Wei Yi comes in
with a twist in the sharpest Najdorf!}) 16... h3 {In the only other game in the
database this move was played, but Wei Yi had anticipated it.} (16... Qg5 {is
the computer choice, but surely Wei Yi had something prepped here. It's amazing
that even in the computer era the Poisoned Pawn Najdorf remains a mystery.})
17. g3 Bb4 {Going for it. From a practical point of view one has to wonder
whether it is a good idea to accept a piece sacrifice which your opponent had
obviously prepared at home. But that being said, that is what you are supposed
to do in the Poisoned Pawn, isn't it?} 18. Qe3 $1 Bxc3 $5 {Picking up the
gauntlet.} (18... Qg5 $5) 19. Nxe6 {What else?} Qe5 $2 {Perhaps this move cost
Areshchenko the game.} (19... fxe6 $1 {Black had to go for it.} 20. Qxe6+ Kd8

quickly. Now however things are not so clear.} 24. Rd5 (24. f8=Q+ Rxf8 25.

something in mind or was he bluffing?}) 24... Qc3 $1) 20. Nc7+ Kf8 21. Qxe5
Bxe5 22. Nxa8 Nxf6 23. Nb6 {The problem for Black is that he doesn't have any
compensation for the lost material. Wei Yi shows excellent technique and takes
the game:} Kg7 24. Nxc8 Rxc8 25. Rf5 Bb8 26. Rdf1 Ba7+ 27. Kh1 Bd4 28. Bd3 Rc6
