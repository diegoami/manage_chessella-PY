take the game into a pawn endgame. A wise decision as the endgme is drawn.}

such an endgame the defending side has two ways to hold. One is to bring
the king back in front of the pawn. The other is to take it as far as
possible in this case a7, b7, a8, b8. As the first method is impossible
because the king is cut off, it makes sense to enter the drawing zone.
However, we will see the Zude doesn't follow the guideline of staying
within the zone.} 72. Kc7 $1 {The right move going towards the drawing
zone.} Qg4 73. Qh7 h5 74. Kb6 $6 ( 74. Kb8 {would have been the right

checking.}) 74... h4 75. Ka5 $6 {It is not yet lost yet because the king
should be in the zone (a7, b7, a8, b8) when the pawn reaches h2. The pawn
is still on h4. Hence this is still a draw, but the white player is taking
too many risks.} (75. Ka7 $11) 75... Qg5+ 76. Ka6 Qf6+ 77. Ka5 $6 (77.

was the last chance for white to make a draw with this move. Mainly the
white king is rushing back towards the drawing zone. Erik Zude's move
is a mistake but I think the mistake was made many moves ago when he decided
to keep his king on a5 and b5 instead of a8 and b8.}) 100... Kc2 101.
