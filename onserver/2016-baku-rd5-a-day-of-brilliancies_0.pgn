{Bok puts Netherlands on top of the table with this fine victory with black.}
1. d4  Nf6  2. c4  e6  3. Nf3  d5  4. Nc3  c6  5. Bg5  h6  6. Bxf6 {(2s) Stupak
has no interest in a theoretical duel in the 'Moscow variation'.} Qxf6  7. e3 
g6  8. e4 $5 {(7s) A very rare choice and an odd continuation.} dxe4  9. Nxe4 
Bb4+  10. Ke2 {(1s) The computers cry that this is a bad move but the idea of
taking his majesty to the battlefield dates back to the time of Steinintz when
he used to, sometimes, opt for 1.e4 e5 2.f4 ef4 3. d4?! Qh4+ 4.Ke2 !!} Qg7  11.
c5 {(132s) Stupak cuts off this bishop and his entire plan revolves around
keeping the bishop on c8 out of the game.} O-O  12. Qa4  Na6  13. Ke3 $2
{(183s) Stupak plays fast and inaccurately. He is playing with fire. It may
seem that he is about to win a piece but in reality he gets his king exposed to
numerous threats.} b5  (13... f5 14. Bxa6 fxe4 {looks also very good for
black.}) 14. cxb6  axb6  15. Qxc6  f5 $5 { (943s) Of course! A king hunt is
about to begin!} 16. Qxa8  Nc7  17. Nf6+  Qxf6  18. Qc6  Nd5+  19. Ke2  Rd8
{(684s) None of White's pieces can protect his king while all of Black's pieces
are active. That all happened with the mere material investment of an exchange
and a pawn!} 20. g3  Bc5 $1 {(610s) Brilliant play by Bok! } 21. Qa4  (21. dxc5
Qxb2+ {wins on the spot.}) (21. Bg2 Ba6+ 22. Ke1 Nb4 { This is the idea of Bc5!
it frees the b4 square for the knight!}) 21... Nb4 $2 {(36s) This almost lets
White escape.} (21... Bxd4 $3 22. Nxd4 (22. Qxd4 Nf4+ 23. gxf4 Rxd4 $19) 22...
Nb4 $3 23. Bg2 (23. Rd1 Qe5+ 24. Kd2 Rxd4+ 25. Kc1 Nd3+ $19) (23. Qxb4 Rxd4 24.
Qb5 (24. Qxb6 Qe5+ 25. Kf3 Qe4#) 24... Ba6 25. Qxa6 Qe5+ 26. Kf3 Qe4#) 23...
Ba6+ 24. Qxa6 Nxa6 $19) 22. Rd1  (22. a3 Ba6+ 23. Ke1 Rxd4 24. Qe8+ Kg7 25.
Bxa6 Rd8 26. Qxd8 (26. Qa4 Qxb2 $19 { [#] Ahh you were worried about castling?
Forget it! White's king has made way too many moves!}) 26... Nc2+ 27. Kd2 Qxd8+
28. Kxc2 Qa8 29. Be2 Qe4+ 30. Kd2 Bxf2 $44 {And it is not easy to imagine how
Bok was going to win this game.}) 22... Bb7  23. Rd2  Ra8  24. Qd1  Bf8 $2
{(29s) Loss of an important tempo.} (24... Rxa2) (24... e5) 25. a3  e5  26.
axb4  exd4  27. Qb3+  Kh8  28. Rd1 $4 {(41s) I have a very hard time
understanding this move.} (28. Bg2 { and I do not see how Black is going to
prove that he has enough compensation when his material investment has gone
from an exchange to a whole rook!}) 28... Re8+  (28... Qe7+ 29. Kd2 Bxf3 30.
Qxf3 Qxb4+ {was probably better!}) 29. Kd2  Bxf3  30. Qxf3  d3 $1 {(1s) Now
White's king is exposed again!} 31. Rb1 $4  (31. Kxd3 Qxb2 32. Qc6 Rd8+ 33. Ke3
Rxd1 34. Kf3 {doesn't seem to be losing just yet. Stupak should have kept his
faith in his king and had to let him to take care of himself!}) 31... Bxb4+
{(63s) Now Black owns White's king.} 32. Kxd3  Qe6 $1 {(18s) accurate play!
This covers all of White's king possible sorties.} 33. Kc2  Rc8+  34. Qc3+ 
Bxc3  35. bxc3  Qc6 {(13s) And finally Bok's attack pays off in this
tupsy-turvy game!} 0-1
