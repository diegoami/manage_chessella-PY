Nb3 Nb6 16. c4 Na4 17. Bd2 Qe7 18. Qc2 {White has a very nice advantage. His
pieces are obviously in better squares, he has targets in Black's pawn
structure and Black doesn't have a good plan.} bxc4 19. dxc4 Bb4 {Black's
pieces are so uncoordinated that White has decisive blow already.} 20. Bxc6 (

{It seems like Mamedyarov is hanging on like a champ. The rook endgame is by no
means easy to win. Black is active and if he can somehow trade off the c-pawns
he will be in great shape to hold a 4v3 draw. However, Mamedyarov flagged! With
this loss he was forced to win the next game.} 1-0
