Kh1 a6 9. a4 b6 10. f4 Bb7 11. Bf3 d5 $5 {Black refrains from solid moves such
as 11...Qc7 and immediately strives for counterplay, even if this compromises
his pawn structure} 12. exd5 exd5 13. Qd3 Nc6 14. Nxc6 Bxc6 15. Be3 Re8 16.
Rad1 Bb4 17. Bd4 Ne4 $5 {This leads to a double-edged position in which Black
is not better but has good chances. Chances that Bogoljubov uses much better
than his opponent.} ({The alternative} 17... Bxc3 18. Qxc3 Bxa4 {offered Black
hardly any prospects, e.g.} 19. b3 Bd7 20. Bxf6 Qxf6 21. Qxf6 gxf6 22. Bxd5 {
with a slight advantage for White.}) 18. Bxg7 {White strikes.} Qh4 $1 {Of
course.} ({After} 18... Kxg7 19. Bxe4 dxe4 20. Qg3+ {Black loses the queen.})
19. Kg1 f6 20. g3 Qh3 21. Nxe4 $2 {In a tactically complicated position White
is the first to go wrong and commits a fatal mistake.} ({Modern engines
recommend} 21. Bg2 {which after e.g.} Bc5+ 22. Kh1 Qh5 23. g4 Qg6 24. Nxe4 dxe4
25. Qc3 Qxg7 26. b4 {might lead to a double-edged position which the engines
evaluate as about equal.}) 21... dxe4 22. Qc4+ Kxg7 23. Qxc6 Bc5+ 24. Kh1 exf3
25. Qxf3 {The sequence that began with 21.Nxe4? cost White a piece. Moreover,
his king is in danger - which Bogoljubow exploits to finishe the game quickly
and energetically.} Re3 $1 26. Qb7+ ({After} 26. Qxa8 Re2 27. Rd7+ Kh6 {
White will be mated on h2.}) 26... Re7 {White resigned. After 27.Qf3 Rae8
Black has an overwhelming attack.} 0-1
