1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+ {After this game, I doubt people will repeat
this line. It has never enjoyed a great reputation, and I understand why -
there are far better options.} (3... d5 {could have been a solid option.}) (
3... c5 {could have been a winning try.}) 4. Bd2 Qe7 5. g3 O-O 6. Bg2 Bxd2+ 7.
Qxd2 d6 8. O-O e5 {This is why I don't like this line - Black wastes tempi
despite being behind in development.} 9. Nc3 Nc6 (9... Nbd7 10. e4 c6 11. Nh4
Nb6 12. b3 a5 $14 {is managable, but White is better.}) 10. Nd5 $1 Qd8 (10...

is a worse version of the game.} b5 16. Rfc1) 11. Rfd1 Re8 12. dxe5 Nxe5 13.
Nxe5 Rxe5 14. Rac1 Bg4 15. Re1 $5 {The start of a really deep plan.} Re8 16.
Rc3 Rb8 17. e4 {The computers are not a fan of Vidit's play, but I am. From
here White slowly takes over.} Nd7 18. f4 Be6 19. b3 a5 20. Rce3 Ra8 21. Qd4
Rb8 (21... a4 $1 22. b4 c6 23. Bf1 $5 (23. a3 Rc8 24. Bf1 Bxd5 25. cxd5 cxd5
26. Qxd5 Qb6 $14) 23... a3 $1 {atleast threatens something on the queenside,
and tries to distract White. Since the objective evaluation of the position is
bad anyway, Black should have aimed for disturbance, not passivity.}) 22. Nc3
$1 f6 23. Nb5 {Now Black's pawns are fixed on c7 and d6.} Ra8 24. Qd2 Qc8 25.
Nd4 Bf7 26. Qc3 Qb8 27. h4 Qa7 28. Bh3 Rad8 (28... Nf8 $1 {would have been a
better defensive try. As is with such a complex game like chess, timing is
everything. Jorge is too late in realising the optimal defensive setup.}) 29.
Kh2 Qc5 30. g4 Nf8 $6 (30... Qb4 $1 {is what principles dictate should be
played. If White exchanges queens, his attack is slowed down, otherwise Black
gets superb counterplay on the queenside with a4 and Nc5. Such a method is
present in the Maroczy as well. I am surprised that a 2686 player opted for
other defensive methods considering he had this at this disposal. Play can now
proceed} 31. Qxb4 axb4 32. Nb5 Rc8 33. g5 Be6 34. Bg2 Nc5 $14 {maintaining a
defensive position.}) 31. g5 $1 Ng6 32. Rf1 Nxh4 $2 {Now now, this is too much.
Cori had probably given up hopes of saving the game.} (32... Qb4 $1 $16 {
was still a possibility. White is considerably better after} 33. Qxb4 axb4 34.
h5 $1 Ne7 $16 {but Black has fighting chances.}) 33. gxf6 $1 gxf6 $2 {This is
hara-kiri.} (33... g6 {asks White how he will break through. I suppose Vidit
would have gone} 34. Qd3 $1 a4 35. Rg3 b5 36. f5 $1 $18 {throwing pieces
forward and winning easily.}) 34. Rg3+ Kf8 35. Ne6+ $1 {A nice shot to end the
game.} Bxe6 36. Qxf6+ Bf7 37. Qh6+ Ke7 38. Qxh4+ Kf8 39. Qh6+ Ke7 40. Rg7 {
A nice game by Vidit, but not as one sided as it initially seemed.} 1-0
