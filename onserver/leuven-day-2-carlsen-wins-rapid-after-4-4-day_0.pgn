Rxc1 21. Rxc1 Rd8 22. Rc7 {[#] It's more than a little remarkable that Kramnik
once more finds himself with a favorable rook endgame that looks very
reminiscent of his game against Nakamura.} Rd2 23. Rxa7 Rxe2 24. Kf3 Rb2 25. g4
{Although the position is balanced, if anyone has hopes of a win, it is White
thanks to the queenside majority.} Kg7 26. h4 e5 27. Ra6 Kg6 28. Rxb6 Rxa2 29.
g5 Kh5 30. Rxf6 Kxh4 31. Rxf7 Kxg5 32. Rxh7 Rb2 33. Rb7 Kf5 {In spite of the
exchnages, little has chnaged fundamentally: White has an extra passed pawn on
the queenside, but Black's strong king and rook should be more than enough to
neutralize it. Still, White alone can aspire to the full point.} 34. Ke3 Rc2
35. Kd3 Ra2 $2 {Though not losing per se, it is a fundamental mistake in
concept.} (35... Rc1 {was the principled move. The reason is simple: it keeps
the white king cut off from supporting his pawn.}) 36. Rc7 Rb2 37. Kc3 Ra2 38.
Rd7 Kf4 $2 {In spite of struggling, Black had been holding on, but short of
time, he misses a subtlety.} (38... Ke4 $1 {was correct. The point is that} 39.
Rd2 {cannot be stopped anyhow, but this prepares the flight of the black king
to stop the b-pawn's march.} Ra8 40. b4 Rc8+ 41. Kb3 Rb8 42. Rc2 Kd5 {and White
will be very hard-pressed to make progress.}) 39. Rd2 Ra8 40. b4 Rc8+ 41. Kb3
Rb8 42. Rd6 $2 {White allows Black to correct his mistake, and while he does,
for a move, it is clear the main defensive idea was missed.} Ke4 43. Rd2 Kf3 $2
44. Rb2 $1 e4 45. Ra2 $2 {A very complex endgame, in spite of the simplified
material, that presents swings in the evaluation that only a computer is able
to see in the time control the game was played in.} (45. Rc2 { was winning.})
45... Rh8 46. b5 Rh2 47. b6 Rh6 48. Ra6 $1 {The threat is b7 of course.} Rh1
