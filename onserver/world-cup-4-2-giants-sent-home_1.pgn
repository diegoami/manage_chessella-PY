losing move.} (61... Ke8 62. f6 (62. d7+ Kd8 63. f6 (63. Kg3 Rc7 $11) 63... Rf4

The point is to first play d7 and Kd5-c6, only then take on b4.}) 65... b3 66.
d7 b2 67. Rb3 Rxb3 68. d8=Q+ Kxf5 {it is amazing, but White has no way of
winning the rook. Wei Yi tries to create as many problems as possible.} 69.

cannot explain why, it all comes down to a forced series of check sequences
that humans are incapable of properly calculating. The computers understand
these kind of positions, we simply don't.}) 73. Qb1 {The chess board is big,
but not big enough for the rook to hide.} Kg5 74. Kc4 Rb8 75. Qg1+ Kf5 76. Qc5+

very soon.} 1-0
