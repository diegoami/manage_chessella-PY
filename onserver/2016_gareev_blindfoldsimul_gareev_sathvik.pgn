Nc4 Nc6 30. Qd1 b5 31. Nd2 Ne7 {I succeeded in my attack. However I realized I
had no quick win, and despite large material deficit my opponent was not going
to resign. I took a few deep breaths and continued in a spirit of a regular
tournament game.} 32. c4 c6 33. a4 Kg7 34. a5 Kf7 35. Qb3 Rg7 36. Qb4 Kg6 37.

this type of situations. I have had several painful experiences where I tried
to play faster and push for a quick win. That didn't go well increasing the
likelyhood of an oversight or a blunder. After playing for over 9 hours, the
most important part is to stay focused and patient.} Kg6 42. Kc3 Kf7 43. Qe5
