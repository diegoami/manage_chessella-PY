1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Rb1 { Not
only does this develop the rook, but it prevents, after cxd4 cxd4, a check on
b4.} (7. Nf3 {is definitely the main line, which transposes to many Kramnik
games. The Russian has employed this very successfully in the recent past.})
7... Be7 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Bxd7+ Nxd7 $5 (9... Qxd7 {had been seen earlier this
year} 10. d5 exd5 11. exd5 O-O {was one of the many draws in the Sharjah Grand
Prix, Aronian-Vallejo Pons.}) 10. Rxb7 {It's the only way to 'punish' black's
set-up, but of course it has a drawback} cxd4 (10... Nb6 11. Nf3 Qc8 12. Rxe7+
Kxe7 13. Ba3 {simply does not work for Black, as the two pawns provided more
than enough compensation for the exchange.}) 11. cxd4 Nb6 {Black's threat is
simple: Qc8 traps the rook. White doesnt really have much in the way of doing
something with the extra tempo to thwart Black's threat.} 12. Qd2 (12. Qc2 Bb4+
13. Kf1 Rc8 {leads to another problem: Black is better developed and White's
center is close to falling apart.} 14. Qb2 O-O {And Black's compensation for
the pawn is enough for a winning advantage.}) (12. Bd2 {100% computer move} Qc8
13. Rxe7+ Kxe7 14. Bb4+ Ke8 15. Ne2 Qc4 $1 {but even here the silicon brains
give the edge to Black.}) 12... Qc8 (12... Bf6 $1 {but Black's move in the game
is also good.}) 13. Rxe7+ Kxe7 14. Nf3 (14. Ba3+ Ke8 {has the unfortunate side
effect of running into Nc4 next move, so White doesn't have time to develop.})
(14. Qg5+ Kf8 {leads nowhere for White.}) 14... f6 15. O-O Kf7 16. e5 f5 {The
question here is if White has enough time to organize an attack against Black's
king. Without the initiative, Black's extra exchange (even though it is for a
pawn) would easily steamroll over the opponent's pieces.} 17. g4 {only move,
White must attack.} Rd8 (17... fxg4 $2 18. Ng5+ Kg8 19. Qf4 {gives White a
sizeable initiative}) 18. Qg5 {it is natural to put the queen on the kingside,
but it's hard to come up with concrete threats.} (18. gxf5 exf5 19. e6+ Kxe6
(19... Kg8 20. Re1 {and White's passed pawn might give chances, but Black is
still much better after} Re8 $1 21. d5 (21. e7 Nd5 22. Ba3 Qd7 $17) 21... Qc4
{is an important double attack.}) 20. Ng5+ Kf6 $13 { might be too much for
Black, the king is easily attacked.}) 18... Kg8 19. Qh5 Rf8 20. Ba3 Qc6 $1 {A
beautiful idea!} (20... Rf7 21. Ng5 g6 22. Qh6 Rg7 $17 { is awkward but also a
good way to continue for Yifan.}) 21. Ng5 (21. Bxf8 Rxf8 $1 {This is more or
less Black's point. White doesn't have a good way of defending the knight on
f3.} 22. Ng5 (22. g5 g6 23. Qh3 Qc3 {is horrible for White.}) (22. Nh4 f4 $1
{and again the knight looks ridiculous on h4.}) 22... h6 {an the knight is
already trapped:} 23. Nh3 Qf3 $19) 21... h6 22. Rc1 Qd7 23. Bxf8 Rxf8 24. Nh3
Qxd4 {Material is even, but now White's king, a-pawn, e-pawn and knight are all
in bad shape. The position is already a technical win and the Chinese super
star converts without problems.} 25. gxf5 Qxe5 26. Qg6 Rf6 27. Qg4 Rxf5 28. Qg3
Qd4 29. Re1 Rf6 30. Qg2 Nd5 31. Kh1 Qd3 32. Rg1 Qf3 33. Rb1 Qf5 34. Rg1 Rf7 35.
Re1 Rf6 36. Rg1 Qf3 37. Rb1 Qh5 38. Rg1 Rf7 39. Re1 Qf5 40. Qg3 Rc7 {With time
control reached Black stops shuffling around.} 41. Ng1 Nf4 42. Rd1 Kh7 43. Qf3
