1. e4 {11 jumps of a brave Knight in only 34 moves, very funny maneuver of the
Indian FM Ameya. If perhaps it is not the best plan, but it is the most
original!} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. f3 e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8.

It was time to change the riding knight, it seems ironic because the black
bishop is inside the chain and does not looks good, but Nxe7 will activate the

An important move to avoid the e4 advance and at the same time threaten the
strong capture in g6, for example:} Nd7 $2 22. Rxg6 $1 Kxg6 23. Qg4+ Kh7 24.

active, king safe...}) 26. Qh3 $18) 20... Bd8 21. Nb7 Bc7 22. Kb1 $6 ({The
protagonist had the secret again, it was time to play more active!} 22. Nxd6
Qe7 23. Bc5 Nd7 24. Nxb5 Nxc5 25. d6 Bxd6 26. Nxd6 $15 {With a very playable
position, white has to handle the little pression in the semi-open lines b and
