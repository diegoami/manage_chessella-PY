1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {According to my database, Eldar has not been employing 2..
.Nf6 since 1999. No doubts it came to me as a big surprise.} 3. e5 ({Another
main line is} 3. Nc3) 3... Nd5 4. Nc3 Nxc3 ({Mamedyarov got a comfortable
position against Wesley So after} 4... e6 {So,W (2792)-Mamedyarov,S (2804)
Tata Steel-A 80th 2018 (1) 1/2-1/2}) 5. dxc3 Nc6 6. Bc4 (6. Bf4 {[%cal Gd1d2,
Ge1c1,Yf1d3,Yd3e4,Yf1c4] looks more logical, and is by far the most popular
choice. The reason is that the f4-square is the only one reasonable square for
the dark-squared bishop in this position. Followed by Qd2 and 0-0-0, White can
choose between Bc4 or Bd3-e4 depending on Black's set-up.}) 6... e6 7. Bg5 $6 {
Useless move. It drives the Black's queen to the ideal square.} (7. Bf4 Qc7 (
7... Qb6 $5) 8. Qd2 h6 9. h4 b6 10. O-O-O Bb7 {Lagno,K (2547)-Paehtz,E (2464)
Huaian IMSA blitz (Women) 2nd 2017 (1.6) 1-0 would lead to the similar
position as in the text without losing a tempo.}) 7... Qc7 8. Bf4 {
Acknowledging the mistake.} h6 9. h4 b6 10. Qd3 {controlling the d6-square and
preparing Ba6 excahnging the bishops} ({After} 10. Qe2 {Eldar could have played
} d5 11. exd6 Bxd6 {which would give a favorable pawn construction to Black.
However, White's advantage in development provides a good counterplay on the
King-side:} 12. Bxd6 Qxd6 13. Rd1 Qc7 14. O-O O-O 15. Bd3 Bb7 16. Qe4 g6 17.
Qe3 Kg7 18. h5 $13) 10... Bb7 (10... a6 $5) 11. O-O-O $6 {The White's King is
moving towards troubles. After Pa6, Pb5, Ne7-d5, Qa5 and Pc4 it is clear that
Black can develop a strong initiative against the White King.} ({In order to
stop Black's next move in the text} 11. Ba6 {could have been tried. However,
it would be met by} Bxa6 12. Qxa6 d5 13. exd6 Bxd6 14. Bxd6 Qxd6 {[%csl Re6,
Gf2,Rf7,Gg2,Rg7,Gh4,Rh6] where Black managed to solve all opening problems.
Moreover, a potential endgame with an extra pawn on the King-side looks
promising for Black.}) ({Perhaps,} 11. Rd1 $5 {, taking control of the
d6-square, as well as keeping the King away from the queen-side, was a
reasonable choice for White.} {After sharp} Na5 $5 (11... a6 12. Qe2) {White
can even think about a pawn sacrifice:} 12. Bb5 $5 Rd8 13. Nd2 Bxg2 14. Rg1 Bb7
15. Qe2 $13) 11... a6 $1 {[%csl Rc4][%cal Gb6b5] Pointing out that White's
set-up is wrong.} (11... O-O-O 12. Ba6 $14) 12. Qe3 $6 {the worst square for
the White Queen, since Ne7-d5 maneuver will come with tempo. Any other choice
would be a lesser evil.} (12. Qe2 b5 13. Bd3 c4 14. Be4 Ne7 $15) (12. Qd2 b5
13. Be2 Ne7 $15) 12... Ne7 {[%csl Rc4,Re3,Rf4][%cal Ge7d5,Gb6b5] The Knight is
going to d5-square. A typical plan for this structure which I missed
completely.} 13. Qe2 b5 14. Bd3 c4 $5 {Perhaps, that is the first step of a
wrong plan. Eldar wanted to exchange the pair of the light-squared Bishops and
Queens. By doing that Black could achieve a slightly better endgame due to
superior Knight placed ideally on d5-square.} (14... Nd5 $1 {more ambitious
approach. After this move White would face a tough decision:} 15. Bg3 {as
Bishop departures from the Queen-side, Black can take advantage of it:} (15. g3
$5 Bc6 16. Be4 Qb7 17. Nd2 a5 18. Rhe1 a4 {with clear domination on the
Queen-side}) (15. Bd2 {looks too passive. Besides, after} c4 16. Be4 a5 $17 {
White's King is hopelessly trapped.}) 15... Qa5 16. c4 {seems to be the only
move which is not loosing on the spot. However, after} (16. Kb1 $6 Nxc3+ 17.

King can never be safe.} 17. Nd4 Rb8 $40 {[%cal Gb5b4]}) 17. Qxc6 dxc6 (17...

accurate than the text move. The idea is that after} Nd5 19. Be3 Be7 20. axb5
