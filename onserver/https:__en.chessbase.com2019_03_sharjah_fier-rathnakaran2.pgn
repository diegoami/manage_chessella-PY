Typical Rathnakaran. He immediately tries to play something unsual and
aggressive.} 10. b3 a6 11. Qd2 e5 12. Nde2 h5 13. Ba3 Re8 14. Bd6 Kh7 15. Nd5 Rh8 16. c5 b5 17. cxb6 h4 18. Rad1 hxg3 19. fxg3 Bh6 20. h3 Nxe3 21. Nxe3 Qxb6 22. Rf3 a5 23. Qc3 Ba6 24. Bc5 Qb7 25. Nxf5 $1 gxf5 26. Rxf5 Rhg8 27. Be4 Kh8 28. Rd6 {Finishing off the game in style. There have been many games in
Rathnakaran's chess career where he has worse, but his opponents have gone
wrong and given him the full point. But Fier made absolutely no mistake and
managed to take home the full point.} 1-0
