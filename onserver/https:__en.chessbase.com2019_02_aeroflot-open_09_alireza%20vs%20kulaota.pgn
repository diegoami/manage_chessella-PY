After facing one Iranian talent in round one, Kulaots was now up against
another talent - Alireza Firouzja.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6
5. Nc3 a6 {The Najdorf it is!} 6. h3 e6 7. g4 Nfd7 8. g5 b5 9. a3 Be7 10. h4
Bb7 11. Be3 O-O {If you play the Sicilian you should be ready for an attack
against your king.} 12. Qd2 Nc6 13. Nxc6 Bxc6 14. O-O-O Qb8 {With the pawn
already on a3, I prefer Black's position. The idea of a5 followed by b4 is
strong and launches a powerful attack against the white king.} 15. f3 a5 16. g6
$5 {[%cal Gg5g6] Alireza realizes that his play on the kingside was not moving
at the desired speed. At the same time Black is ready to kick his knight away
from c3 with b4. More than a thematic move in such positions, I would call it
a desparate way to stir up things.} b4 17. Nb1 d5 18. gxf7+ Rxf7 19. Bh3 Nf8 {
The knight does a good job of defending the e6 square.} 20. axb4 Bxb4 21. c3

shattered king, you will not be able to survive for long.} Qd6 $1 27. Kc2 (27.
