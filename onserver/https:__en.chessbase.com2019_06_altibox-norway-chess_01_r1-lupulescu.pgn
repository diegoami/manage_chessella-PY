already occurred in 38 games according to my database. It is the kind of move
you can explain to kids by saying "super grandmasters can do it." White's idea
is to prepare the development of his dark squared B on b2 while keeping
options on the kingside.} Qd7 {Black reckons that if White can play like this
he is also allowed to do the same} 7. b3 b6 8. Bb2 Bb7 {continuing the
"imitation game"} 9. Nd5 {White has probably had enough of Black's mirroring
