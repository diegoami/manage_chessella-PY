a bit of experience on the White side of this variation, and I have always
found this reply the most annoying.} ({White does well after the standard
procedure} 6... Be6 7. Qf3 g6 8. Nge2 Nd7 9. h3 {there he continues with
g2-g4.}) 7. Na4 (7. Rb1 {is OK, but then White cannot castle long.}) 7... Qa5+
