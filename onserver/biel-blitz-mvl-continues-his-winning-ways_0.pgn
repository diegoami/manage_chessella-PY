O-O Rad8 16. Rfd1 b6 $1 {Suddenly things are very bad as ...b5 and ...b4
condemn the bishop.} 17. Ba3 b5 18. Ncd2 b4 19. Nxg5 $1 {White's only fighting
chance. White grabs a pawn to maximize material gain for the lost bishop.} Ncd4
{Black tries to hit back.} (19... hxg5 {would let White back in with} 20. Bxc6
Qe7 21. Bxe8 Rxe8 22. Bxb4 Qxb4 23. Ne4 {and things are no longer clear.}) 20.
exd4 Nxd4 21. Qe3 bxa3 $2 {It seems hard to believe, but capturing the bishop
was a mistake. Not a losing one, but it reverses the balance of power.} (21...
Bg4 {was the correct continuation according to the engines, but good luck
finding that in a blitz game.} 22. Ngf3 bxa3 23. bxa3 f5 {and Black has a small
pull.}) 22. Nxe6 axb2 23. Nxd8 $3 {With a pawn attacking the rook and promoting
to queen, it would have been easy to be lulled into playing the rook, but White
is not to be misled.} (23. Rb1 $2 Qxe6 24. Rxb2 e4 $1 25. dxe4 Nf5 $1 {and the
point of e4 is clear: it opened the diagonal for the bishop to allow} 26. Qa3

{GM Daniel King said that with the dust settled, he preferred White, and right
he is.} Nf5 26. Qxa7 Qxd3 27. Qxc7 e4 28. Ne5 Bxe5 29. Qxe5 e3 30. fxe3 Nxe3
