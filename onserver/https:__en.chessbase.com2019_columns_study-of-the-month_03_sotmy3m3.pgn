{In Vienna, Mandler met many great chess players and this coproduction with
Imre König is among my favorites for its fourfold echo, light setting and
ultimately humor, showing that already in January 1924 Mandler's talent could
get him a chuckle. White to move and win.} 1. f7 $1 ({White can try other
ideas, and while Mandler's defenses aren't the only ones, ultimately they
easily draw.} 1. Rf2 $2 Rf3 $1 ({Among this study's more extended analysis, i.

{I would like to take this November 1967 study from "TfS", as it is commonly
abbreviated, to show how an incorrectness and correction of an idea can spawn
something new. Mandler's original solution and the "cook" (unintended solution)
are shown here, the correction split this study into two positions to show
both solutions. Another idea would have been to keep the position but make the
stipulation into "Draw. 2 solutions", although such multiple solutions are
usually used in helpmates, rarely in directmate problems and almost never in
endgame studies. White is to move and draw.} 1. Na5+ ({The unintended solution

{See the previous entry for the explanation. To be added here is that Mandler
was extremely lucky to have b3 as a square that corrects the study, as the
rook remains incredibly attacked but not able to be taken. White to move draws
in the originally intended way instead. Readers will easily figure out why the
perpetual check won't work here (remember what refuted the try in the other
twin).} 1. Na5+ R3b7 2. Ka3 $1 Ka7 3. Bxb7 Bxb7 4. Nc6+ Bxc6 $11 1/2-1/2

{This study originally was published with a different solution, but it was
changed later. As this makes the study the most extensive of the entire
Mandler research into this position (further research was done for example by
Werner Speckmann in the field of moremovers), it was included here as just one
example of the many subtleties of this endgame. Here White is to move and win.
We give all the complicated variations of the later changed solution here.} 1.

through all the variations, or just skip them and only watch the main
