the king side, harmony of pieces, next maneuver with the knight, against a
poor black position that still does not end its development with the somewhat
awkward pieces and little space to maneuver. This was the position that
Karthikeyan reached today and materialized in a very instructive way} Qd6 18.

25. cxd3 {The type of positions where there is an exception to the rule. pair
of bishops, double pawns. But those bishops cannot play, and the pawns defend
a strong knight, open lines for the rooks etc. In addition the space advantage
of the king side is also making a difference.} Qg7 26. Rhe1 Bf6 27. Bb4 hxg4

way to look for some activity in the position, even so the white advantage
already achieved is very large.} 29... Rxe5 30. dxe5 Bxe5) 30. Qa4 ({More

strong initiative.} Rxe1 34. Rxe1 Re8 35. Rc1 ({Stronger, forcing the rook
black to defend the eighth row and leaving black in a kind of zugzwang, the
weakness of the black squares due to a6 is also an important aspect of the
position.} 35. Rh1 Kb8 36. Qc5 Ka8 37. Kc2 Qf7 38. Kc3 {It seems very ironic
but c3 and d2 are a very good squares for the king. Defend d3 and d4, and
black can't do anything to attack him.} Qg7 39. Qd6 Qf7 40. Rh3 Qg7 41. Qh2 $18
