{I have annotated this game for CBM 185. For this article I have kept just
some brief comments.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. c4

14. Rae1 h5 {After some mutual inaccuracies in the opening, explained in my
extended comments, we reached a position both players had been aiming for.
Ivan put his bid on playing on both wings while I mainly relied on my better
central coordination.} 15. Nd1 h4 16. Bc3 Bh6 17. Ne3 Nh5 {Later that evening,
a mutual friend told me that, while praising my play, Ivan mainly put the
blame for his defeat on this move. Indeed, it allows White a surprisingly
effective regrouping.} 18. Bf3 Ng7 ({Against} 18... Bh3 {I had prepared} 19.

g4 $18 {trapping the bishop.}) 19. Bd1 $1 {Ivan kindly praised this move,
after which White is better prepared for the kingside battle.} Bh3 {Black
tries including as many pieces as possible into the attack.} 20. Ng2 f5 21. f4
({Ivan told me that he was worried about} 21. Nxh4 Bxf1 22. Rxf1 {and this had
been my first candidate, too. But the last move is strong enough.}) 21... b4 {
Black needs freeing the queen from the task of defending the knight, in order
to include her into the attack. But strategically this is a concession, as
White is absolved of any queenside worries now.} 22. Bb2 Bxg2 23. Kxg2 exf4 24.
e5 $5 {Not the only way already, but possibly the most spectacular.} fxg3 25.
e6 $16 {[%csl Ga5] The advance of the e-pawn has forever cut off the a5-knight
from real life. Even though I had lost two pawns in the process, I assumed I
would repell the attack rather soon, and then start my own, decisive, one.
Ivan confessed he had hopes that attacking with a reduced number of pieces
would be succesful due to the exposure of my king. He obviously underestimated
WHite's perfect coordination.} Qg5 26. Nf3 h3+ $5 27. Kxh3 Qg4+ 28. Kg2 Nh5 29.

this to be simpler than} 32. Nxh6+ Kh7 33. Bxc2 Kxh6 34. hxg3 $18) ({But} 32.

with a decisive attack.}) 1-0
