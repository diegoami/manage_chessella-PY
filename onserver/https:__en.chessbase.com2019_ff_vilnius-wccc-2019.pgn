{[%evp 0,3,29997,29998,29999,-30000]} {Looking at the position, the first
point one notices is that three black pieces can take the rook on c3. At the
moment there are mates set up for each capture: 1...Kxc3 2 Be5#, 1...Qxc3 2
Qe4# and 1...Nxc3 2 Qd2#. There is also a mate after Black's only check by 1...
Qxb5+ 2 Nxb5#. However, there are several Black moves for which no mate is
prepared; for example, 1...Qc2 or 1...Qc4. My first thought was to create a
threat which would force Black to take on c3, leading to the pre-arranged
mates, but it proved hard to create a reasonable threat.} 1. Qa2 $1 (1. Qe2 {
threatens 2 Qe5#, but by leaving d5 undefended allows Black to play 1...Qxb5+.
After a few minutes, I gave up the idea of creating a threat and instead
focussed on putting Black is zugzwang. This immediately seemed more promising,
as Black has no real 'pass' moves and most Black moves already have a mate
arranged. However, 1...Qc2 seemed a particularly awkward move to meet. What
weakness could this move create that would allow a mate?}) ({Suddenly, I had
the idea of} 1. Qb2 {so as to meet 1... Qc2 by 2 Qb4# and 1...Qxb2 by 2 Rd3#.
However, this fails, one reason being that, like 1 Qe2, it allows 1... Qxb5+.
But I was very close to the answer with this try. Just going one square
further with 1 Qa2! provided the solution. As soon as I saw that by
controlling d5 through the black queen, this again prevented 1...Qxb5+, I knew
that it had to be correct.}) {There are several variations:} 1... Qxa2 (1...
Kd5 2. Rd3#) (1... Kxc3 2. Be5#) (1... Qxb5+ 2. Nxb5#) (1... Qxc3 2. Nf5#) (
1... Nxc3 2. Qd2#) (1... Qc4 2. Qxc4#) (1... Qc2 2. Qc4#) 2. Rd3# {It's a nice
touch that 1. ..Qxc3 is now met by a completely different mate to that
prepared in the diagram.} *

This position can be solved by pure logic, so that despite the many pieces
it's actually fairly easy. The first pont is that White has to act quickly,
with checks or immediate threats, since once Black plays, for example, ...Qf8,
there is no hope of a quick mate. The most obvious idea is to threaten mate by
playing the queen to h1 or h2, but there are several queen moves which
accomplish this. Which one is correct? Since it wasn't obvious to me where the
queen should go, I decided to just try one and see what happens.} 1. Rc1 $1 ({
After} 1. Qg1 {White threatens two different mates in one, and it's clear that
the only defence is} g3 {but it was quickly apparent that this presents a
major problem, since after} 2. Rxg3 (2. Qxg3 g4 {is no better}) 2... g4 {
the king can slip away to g5 and there is no hope of mating by move 5.}) ({
Since ...g3 was so awkward, I then tried} 1. Qg3 {so as to block the g-pawn.
This threatens 2 Qh2#, and forces the reply} Be5 {Once again this seemed to be
the end, but then I wondered if it might be possible to sacrifice the queen by}
2. Qh3+ gxh3 3. Rxh3+ Kg4 4. Bd7+ {which fails only because the king can move
to f4. Then it occurred to me that this would work if Black's bishop were on
f4 rather than e5. At once the whole thing became clear. In the diagram, the
bishop must first be deflected from b2 to c1, so that when it moves to stop
Qh2# it goes to f4 rather than e5, setting up the queen sacrifice.}) {So the
solution is 1 Rc1!} 1... Bxc1 2. Qg3 Bf4 ({or} 2... Bf1 3. Qh2+ Bh3 4. Rxh3+

{[%evp 0,3,29997,29998,29999,-30000]} {A quick check showed that every Black
move is already provided with a mate: 1. ..e4 2 Rf4#, 1...f5 2 Ng5#, 1...Be2 2

would solve the problem, but it's a World Solving Championship so you can't
expect such an easy solution. It quickly became clear that White couldn't
preserve these mates and would have to give some of them up, replacing them by
new mates. Making the reasonable assumption that Black will again be in
zugzwang after the first move, which of the above mates is likely to be left
intact by the key? It's hard to see how 1. ..f5 can create any weakness apart
from unguarding g5, so it's likely that 1... f5 2 Ng5# will not be disturbed.

{[%evp 0,5,3237,29996,29997,29998,29999,-30000]} {A first glance at the
position shows that the black king has no moves, so any knight check could
potentially give mate. However, at the moment f5 and g6 are covered twice,
while a check on c6 is met by ...bxc6+, preventing mate in 3. Black has the
quite strong threat of ...Nef3, giving his king an escape route via f6, and
White's first move must take this into account. The knights are in such
excellent positions that it's hard to imagine one of them moving on the first
move, so the obvious piece to move is the queen, which also gives White the
chance to circumvent the defence by ...Nef3. At first sight there's not an
especially promising queen move, since the squares on the f-file are covered,
while moving the queen in another direction allows ...Kf6. However, this is
where it's necessary to look a little more closely to see if a potential
difficulty is more apparent than real. White can meet 1...Kf6 by 2 Nd7+,
forcing 2...Ke7, after which almost any check by the white queen would be mate.
So we can move the queen off the f-file, and the most obvious place is b2,
since this lines the queen up with the f6-square in preparation for possible
mates by, for example, Nf5+ followed by Ng6# (although that doesn't work right
away). Sometimes this type of reasoning leads straight to the key, and that's
the case here.} 1. Qb2 $1 {is indeed correct, with the threat 2 Qb4+ Kf6 3
Qd6#. There are several ways Black can prevent this, by using either his rook
or the knight on e1. The four key variations are} Nd3 (1... Nc2 2. Ng6+ Kf6 (
2... Nxg6 3. Nf5#) 3. Nxc2#) (1... Ra5 2. Nec6+ Kf6 (2... bxc6 3. Nxc6#) 3.
Nb5#) (1... Ra4 2. Ndc6+ Kf6 (2... bxc6 3. Nxc6#) 3. Nc4#) 2. Nf5+ Kf6 (2...
Nxf5 3. Ng6#) 3. Nxd3# {In each of these four lines only one of the four
available knight checks works. In the case of the rook moves, this is because
one particular knight must be reserved to cut off the black rook after 2...Kf6.
In the case of the black knight moves, it's because the black knight must be
captured when White gives discovered check. There are two sidelines: 1...Bf5 2
Nxf5+ Nxf5 (after 2...Kf6 almost any knight move mates) 3 Ng6# and 1...Kf6 2
Nd7+ Ke7 3 Qb4#.} *

{[%evp 0,6,-1558,-641,-1018,-491,-1112,29999,-30000]} {In a helpmate, spotting
the mating position is the key element. Here the crucial observation is very
simple: if both white pawns disappeared into thin air then Black would be
mated. But how can White engineer the requisite double check? Perhaps the most
straightforward idea is to play Rf7 and later Rc7#, and for this to happen
Black must start with 1...d6, to allow the rook to f7. So let's play 1...d6 2
Rf7. That still leaves two moves to dispose of the white pawns. White has only
one spare move and he can get the c5-pawn out of the way by playing cxd6,
leaving two black moves to remove the other pawn. At first sight Black can do
this by ...Rxd5 and ...Rd4, or ... Kxd5 and ...Kc4, but the position of the
white king means that 2...Rxd5 would pin the c5-pawn and so prevent cxd6. Thus
the solution is unique and runs 1...d6 2 Rf7 Kxd5 3 cxd6 Kc4 4 Rc7#. That
still leaves the question of the second solution open. Sometimes there is no
connection between the different solutions of a helpmate, but more often there
is an analogy. The first solution involved a switchback (a piece moving away
from, and then returning to, its original square) by the white rook and the
black king. Could the other solution also involve switchbacks? A switchback by
the white bishop would seem to involve playing Bh7 and then Bg8. Which other
black piece could perform a switchback? Playing ...Bxc5 and ...Ba7 is unlikely
as there's no obvious reason why the bishop should go to a7 rather than
another square. The rook is a far more likely candidate, playing ...Rxd5 and
then ...Rd4. That ties in with the white bishop switchback, as the bishop
would need to be on h7 to allow the rook to return to d4. The simplest is to
try these moves at the start of the solution: 1...Rxd5 2 Bh7 Rd4 3 Bg8+ and
then it's immediately clear that the final move has to be 3...d5 4 cxd6#} 1...
d6 ({Thus the solutions are:} 1... Rxd5 2. Bh7 Rd4 3. Bg8+ d5 4. cxd6# {and})

When faced with a board full of pieces and five moves to play with, it might
seem almost impossible to figure out the solution, and in such cases you can
hardly proceed by trial and error. Instead you have to work out (or guess!)
the point of the problem. Looking first at White's immediate checks, he could
play 1 Rd6+ Kxe5 and then a discovered check. Of course the first move is very
unlikely to be a check, but at this stage we are just trying to get
inspiration. There's also 1 Nf3+ Kxe4 followed by a discovered check, so we
can guess that these sequences will be important in the solution. Another
check is 1 Nc6+ Kxc4, but unlike the other two this doesn't at the moment lead
to a discovered check. Looking again at 1 Rd6+ Kxe5, a promising follow-up
would be 2 Rxe6+ (or else the king can run to f6) 2...Kd4, but further
progress seems impossible as the black king can move to c4. If we put these
two facts together: that there is no discovered check after 1 Nc6+ Kxc4, and
that it would be helpful to have c4 guarded after 1 Rd6+ Kxe5 2 Rxe6+ Kd4,
then there is a strong suggestion that the key is} 1. Rc8 {and indeed this was
almost the first move I tried. It's true that Nc6+ can now be met by ...dxc6,
but if Black moves his d-pawn then the check followed by discovered check
sequence will operate. The next step is to find the threat, but now that c4 is
covered it's not hard to see that White can play 2 Rd6+ Kxe5 3 Rxe6+ Kd4 4
Be5+ Nxe5 5 Rd6#. This threat entails a sequence of two checks to force the
black king to take a white unit on an adjacent square and then return to d4.
White then uses the newly vacated square to sacrifice another piece to force
mate. There are two other potential black king captures, on c4 and e4, which
might fit in with this pattern. There are few Black moves which stop the
threat, only 1...d5 and 1...Ne7 (to interpose on d5). Taking} d5 {first, we
already surmise this will be met by} ({The other variation,} 1... Ne7 {is met

Nf3# {completing the pattern of three closely related lines.}) 2. Nc6+ Kxc4 {
and now we must stop ...Kb3 so that forces} 3. Nxa5+ Kd4 {when everything is
set up for the sacrifice on the newly vacated c4-square:} 4. Rc4+ Bxc4 5. Nc6#
