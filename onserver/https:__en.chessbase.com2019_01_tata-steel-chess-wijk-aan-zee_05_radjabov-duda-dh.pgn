[%cal Gd2g5] This is the most tricky of White's two continuations. It also
scores better than the alternative.} (7. Nbxd2 {is equally popular and was
chosen by Carlsen in his game against Caruana from Norway in 2018:} a5 8. c3

with good compensation for the pawn in Carlsen-Caruana, Norway Chess 2018 (1-0)
}) 7... a5 {A common idea, although it is unclear whether the insertion of the
a-pawn moves is beneficial for Black.} (7... Qd6 {and}) (7... O-O {are both
more popular than the text.}) 8. a4 O-O ({It is worth pointing out that the
natural} 8... dxe4 $6 {is a mistake due to very concrete reasons:} 9. Nxe5 O-O
10. Nxf7 $1 Rxf7 11. dxe4 Qe7 12. Bxf7+ Kxf7 13. f3 $14 {and the material
imbalance should favour White.}) 9. exd5 Nxd5 {After this, Black must play
extremely accurately to maintain the balance.} (9... cxd5 $1 {leads to some
fascinating variations which would justify the inclusion of 7...a5:} 10. Nxe5

natural moves:} 11. d4 Nc6 12. O-O Nxe5 13. dxe5 Rxe5 14. Nc3 $14) 11. d4 (11.

and Black's active pieces give him sufficient compensation for the pawn. For
example:} 14. Qd1 Rb8 15. Nc3 Nd6 $1 {[%cal Gd6f5,Gf5d4]} 16. Qd2 Nf5 17. Rad1
Ba6 18. Rfe1 Rfe8 $44 {White's bishop on b3 is poor and the d4-pawn is weak.
Black's compensation is undeniable.}) 10. O-O f6 11. h3 Be6 $6 {Allowing a
dangerous initiative.} (11... c5 {looks slightly counterintuitive, but seems
to be Black's best chance to equalise. The idea is simply to prevent any
central pawns (as seen in the game). Surprisingly, White may continue as if
nothing happened:} 12. d4 $5 (12. Nc3 Be6 $11) 12... cxd4 13. Nxd4 $1 Nc6 $1 (
13... exd4 14. Qxd4 Be6 15. Rd1 Nc6 16. Qe4 Re8 17. Nc3 $1 $14 {and White will
regain his piece thanks to the many pins.}) 14. Nxc6 bxc6 15. Nc3 Be6 16. Rfd1
Rb8 $11 {and it appears that any simplifications should lead to a draw.}) 12.

play, for example:} 15. Rxe4 $2 f5) (13... f5 $6 14. Ng5 $14 {is simply better
for White.}) 14. Rxe4 $14 Bf5 15. Re2 Kh8 16. Nc3 b6 {[%cal Ga8a7,Ga7e7] This
makes sense, but again Black's plan is very slow.} (16... Bg4 {would have been
an interesting try}) ({while} 16... Na6 17. Rae1 Nac7 {would have kept White's
advantage to a minimum.}) 17. Rae1 Ra7 18. Nxd5 cxd5 19. Qf4 Bg6 20. c3 Rd7 21.

err.} (22. g4 $5 {is difficult to play for a human. It feels that White's
advantage can be nurtured without the need for such risks. However, this was
the moment to strike.} Bf7 (22... g5 23. Qh2 gxh4 24. gxh5 $18 {is hard to
evaluate at first, but White's more active pieces ensure a decisive advantage.}

to activate his pieces.} 23. Qf5 Nc6 24. Nf3 Ne7 25. Qb1 {A sign that things
have not gone according to plan. White is forced to retreat.} Ng6 26. Bc2 Rg7

Radjabov decides to repeat moves.} (27. Nh2 $1 $14 {[%cal Gh2f1,Gf1g3,Gg3f5]
