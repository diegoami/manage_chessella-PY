{I played this game for our club championship at DD in The Hague. I was a little
bit nervous because my opponent Pim Ghijsen has a KNSB rating of 2124, while I
have a KNSB rating of 1613. And the second reason I was a little bit nervous was
because I had Black! However, the opening went okay for me, but in the
middlegame White got the upper hand, and in fact could have gotten an advantage.
But I am especially proud of how I played the endgame. That saved the game!

see a lot, and I was just thinking about the game that I played at the
Kennemer open tournament a month ago. The opening was a Petroff, but with a
similar pawn setup. In that game, however, the queens were still on the board. So
with the text move Black will isolate the pawn.  JS Niels gave this a ? but it
also puts pressure on White, so I've gone for !?} (19... b5 {Of course much

instinct said that I had to play this move, but apparently it is a very weak

the lonely pawn on a3, as the knight can attack it. JS A good move
positionally, but Black is unlikely to move the knight from d5, so it could be
deferred. Instead, I'd like to activate the knight first. Ideally, it would
like to go to c5 but it is hard to achieve immedaitely, so perhaps something like} (

battle in which Niels ended up after the opening with rather less space but with a
nice knight on d5. His pawn thrust to a3 was double-edged, but White's b3-b4?!
left the knight safe on d5 with a perfectly playable position. Bf4, exchanging
the dark-squared bishops was positionally suspect. In what should, with good
play, have been at least a somewhat advantageous position, White hurried with
Bxd5 and then fell into a tacical trap, losing on the spot.} 0-1
