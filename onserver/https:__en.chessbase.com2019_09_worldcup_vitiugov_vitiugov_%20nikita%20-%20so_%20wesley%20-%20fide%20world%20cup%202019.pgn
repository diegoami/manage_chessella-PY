over 1000 games already having been played from this position.}) 6... Nxe5 7.
dxe5 Nxc3 8. bxc3 {Although this is a theoretical position, I would like to
take a look at it in some detail. The main reason being the interesting
imbalances in this position. Let's jot down the imbalances. 1. The first
thing that strikes you is the pawn structure. Black clearly seems to have a
better structure as he doesn't have any doubled pawns like White has on the
c-file. 2. Thanks to the e5 pawn, White has some space advantage. 3. White has
a majority on the kingside while Black has a majority on the queenside. 4.
White has the semi open b-file which could prove useful. After listing the
imbalances you begin to understand a few things. The pawn structure is really
not the main thing in the position. It would have been if Black had knights on
the board. Imagine adding a knight on d7 and a white knight on f3. Suddenly
things are not so clear, because the knight gets a very nice square on c5
because of the pawn structure. As there are only bishops on the board, White
doesn't have to worry about his pawn weaknesses for now. Also the pawns on
c2-c3 prevent Black pawns from advancing. easily on the queenside. Imagine you
had a pawn on b2 instead of c3. One can easily imagine the move c5 being more
powerful as then Black wants to run down White with c4,d4 and so on. With the
doubled pawns, it is not so easy for Black to push on. For White on the other
hand, the pawn majority on the kingside is easier to expand with f4-f5. Black
can stop White pawns after f4, by playing ...f5. However, that gives White a
passed pawn on e5, as we see in the game. All in all I feel that the position
is slightly better for White.} Be7 9. O-O (9. Qh5 Be6 10. Rb1 Qd7 11. h3 O-O-O

Vitiugov builds up this position.} 14. Rfd1 c5 15. Kh1 g6 16. h3 Qc7 17. Qf2 {
Not only putting pressure on the c5 pawn but also to reroute the bishop to f3.}
b6 $6 {Although this looks like a normal move, it might have been a good idea
to not touch this pawn without any provocation. The reason being it gives
White a hook to open up a line on the queenside at a later date with a5.} 18.

with g5, but he is not able to execute it.} 21. a5 $1 b5 22. a6 $1 {Now the b5
pawn will also be a small weakness.} Rd7 (22... g5 23. fxg5 Bxg5 24. Bxg5 Rxg5

more beneficial for White than Black.}) 23. Rdb1 Rb8 24. Bf2 Rdd8 25. Qe2 Qb6
26. Rb2 $1 {Again we see how Vitiugov is good at making these little moves.
The idea is not to double on b-file as then the a6 pawn would fall, but to
actually create a square on b1 for the queen.} Rd7 27. Qf1 $1 {The queen makes
a square on e2 for the bishop and gets ready to jog back to b1.} Rc7 28. Be2

because b5 hangs.}) (29... Bc6 {was perhaps a better idea as now Ra5 is not so
easy, but White can just improve his position slowly.}) 30. Ra5 $1 Kg7 31. Qa1
