{Juan Carlos Gonzales is Mexico's highest rated player and a very sympathetic
person at the same time. He finished third in the tournament, generally
playing sound chess. But his second round adventure surely is entertaining.[#]
White has burned all bridges behind him, giving up the castle and the
connection of rooks. Black reacted in a principled way (an attack on the wing
should answered with a counterblow in the centre) but it did not work.} 16...
dxc4 17. bxc4 c5 18. d5 Nd6 19. Rg4 {As inviting as it may look, the uncastled
king is not easy to harass. Things are different with his colleague.} Rc7 $2 (
19... Ng6 $14 {would have somewhat slowed down White's attack.}) 20. Rh4 ({
Missing the combination} 20. Bxh7+ $1 Nxh7 21. Rh4 $18) 20... g6 {The
weakening of the long diagonal is decisive.} ({Black could have hanged on for
a while with} 20... Nf5 $16) 21. Qg3 Bb7 22. Ne4 Nxe4 23. Bxe4 exd5 ({There is
no time to save the exchange with, say} 23... Rdd7 {due to} 24. Qe5) 24. Bf6 {
The rest is simple.} Qe8 25. Bxd8 Qxd8 26. Bxd5 Rd7 27. Qe5 Ne6 28. Rg4 Nc7 29.
