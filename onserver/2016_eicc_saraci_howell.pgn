and has no compensation. Black's position is so precarious indeed that Howell
did not dare to play on trying to prove that he is the better player. White, a
20-year old untitled player from Kosovo, on the other hand, probably did not
want to tempt fate and was happy to draw against a grandmaster.} 1/2-1/2
