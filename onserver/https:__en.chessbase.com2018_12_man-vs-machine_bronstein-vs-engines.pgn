1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 d5 3. c4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Qc2 O-O 6. e4 {Attacking the centre,
and posing Black the question what is going to do about it...} dxe4 {Take with
a pawn, with the knight, or not at all? Already a human could think for a few
minutes on this move.} 7. Nxe4 Nxe4 8. Qxe4 {And at the end of the exchanges
only one player is standing in control of the centre. Once more we see how the
programmers still didn't know how to convey such knowledge to the program.}

the pawns and creates more weaknesses that White can attack.} Nf6 10. Qe2 (10. Qh4 {
this was a possible alternative.} Re8 (10... Nd5 11. Qxh7#) 11. O-O c5 12.

way to centralise the rook, thanks to freeing the d8 square.} 12. Bd2 Qxc5 13.

programmers told the chess program to control as many squares as possible.} 14.

his pieces near the enemy king...a coincidence?} Rac8 16. Rad1 Ba4 17. b3 Bc6 $6
18. b4 Qb6 19. a3 Ba4 {The problem is: even if Black has the control of the d-file,
but no way to actually enter in the enemy territory, then it is useless.} 20. Rc1 Qc7 21. Rfe1 {Black is oblivious to what is to come...I guess the engine didn't learn from Tal's games!} Bf8 22.
Bb1 b6 23. Qf3 a6 24. Qh3 h6 {White, like an annoying mosquito, finally had
Black create a weakness he can exploit. Here we can learn how a top-player
like Bronstein exploits a small weakness like the h6 pawn, and creates a devastating
kingside attack.} 25. Qe3 Qb7 $6 (25... Be8 {Probably Black needed to amass
troops to defend the king pronto.}) 26. h4 (26. f4 {Modern engines indicate this is the move
White should have played.}) 26... Be7 $6 {Not a good idea! Before f7 was
protected by the queen, now she cannot see f7 anymore...} 27. g4 Ne8 $4 {
and the game is over! Here the engine evaluation went from a +1.2 advantage for
White to over +7!} 28. Nxf7 $1 Kxf7 {and here immediately my engine sees a
checkmate in 6 moves.} 29. Qxe6+ Kf8 30. Bh7 1-0
