{The top seed and the local hero, GM Ahmed Adly, didn't disappoint his fans. On
the contrary, he won the tournament in style, with a massive number of wins,
eight to be precise, delighting the public with his entertaining play. In the
following game, a critical moment appeared and the question was how to
continue? Breaking with the typical 15. c5 or perhaps...} 15. g4 $1 {the more
aggressive the better:)} g6 16. Ng3 exd4 ({if} 16... c5 17. d5 {with a
preferable position for White.}) 17. Nxd4 Nb8 $2 {A bit too passive, handing
White free hand in the remaining of the game. Black's position is not ideal but
is far from losing immediately} ({Better was} 17... Nc5 18. g5 ({The same idea
as in the game after} 18. e5 {doesn't work as well} dxe5 19. Nb5 Qb6) 18...
Nfd7 {White is pressing but Black can bounce back in a King's Indian fashion.})
18. e5 $1 {You should not give the initiative into Ahmed's hands!} dxe5 19. Nb5
