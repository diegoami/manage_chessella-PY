Rxd8 47. Rxd8 {This ending is definitely drawn but Black cannot afford to take
the defensive task lightly. In particular, if he loses the e-pawn then White is
winning.} Kg6 48. Kf3 Kf5 49. Rf8 h5 50. Ke3 Kg5 51. Kd3 {At the moment,
Black's pieces provide a barrier to the entry of the white king, so BÃ¶nsch
tests out the idea of moving his king around via the queenside.} Kg6 52. Kc4
Kg5 53. Kd3 {The king cannot go any further since Black could draw by giving up
the knight; for example,} (53. Kb5 Ne4 54. Rg8+ Kf5 55. Kc4 Nxg3 56. Rxg3 h4

55. Kf3 Kf5 56. Kg2 Kg5 57. Kh3 {White tries the alternative and more dangerous
plan of playing his king to h4 and trying to put Black in zugzwang.} Kf5 58.
Rf7 Kg6 59. Re7 Kf5 60. Kh4 e4 {This still draws, but it is a concession to
advance the pawn to e4 as now the white king has access to d4 and f4.} ({Black
could have made his life easier by refusing to touch the e-pawn.} 60... Ne4 61.

so easily.} (66... Kf6 {keeping control of e3, was simpler.}) 67. Ke3 Ng4+ 68.
Kd4 e3 {White has made some progress and by now Black's position requires
accurate defence. This move does not lose, but requires superhuman accuracy (at
30 seconds per move).} (68... Nf6 69. Rf8 Kg6 {was better, since White cannot
play his king to e5. The problem with playing ...e3 is that it effectively
immobilises the knight.}) 69. Rf8+ Kg5 70. Kd3 Kg6 $2 {Now the position is
lost. The only drawing move is the surprising} (70... Nh6 $1 {since} 71. Kxe3
(71. Rh8 Nf5 72. Rg8+ Kf6 {also defends}) 71... h4 72. gxh4+ Kxh4 73. Kf4 Kh5
{is a standard drawing position. The key idea is to transfer the knight to f5,
since from this square the knight not only defends the e3-pawn but also keeps
white tied down to the defence of g3.}) 71. Ke2 $2 { Giving Black a second
chance. The winning idea is to transfer the rook to the fifth rank; for
example,} (71. Ra8 Kf6 72. Ra5 Kg6 73. Ke2 Kh6 74. Kf3 Kg6 75. Kf4 Kh6 76. Ra6+

(72. Rg8+ $1 {so that after} Kf5 73. Ra8 Nh6 74. Kxe3 { Black cannot swap pawns
by ...h4}) 72... Kf5 $2 {The last drawing possibility was} (72... Nh6 $1 73.

Kg6 76. Ra6+ Kf7 77. Kf3 {This wastes time but does not endanger the win. White
makes no progress over the next few moves but eventually hits on the right
idea.} Kg7 78. Re6 Kf7 79. Re4 Kg6 80. Kf4 Kf6 81. Ra4 Kg6 82. Ra5 Kf6 83. Ra6+

off one way or another. The alternative is} ( 85... Kd7 86. Re6 Kd8 87. Kf4 Kd7

the h-pawn.}) 86. Rb7+ Kf8 87. Kf4 {Now that the enemy king is stuck on the
back rank, White can play Ke3 followed by Rb5, winning a pawn} e2 88. Rb1 Nf2
