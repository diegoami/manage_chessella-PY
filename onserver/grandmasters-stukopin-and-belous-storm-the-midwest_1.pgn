{Another key game of the tournament, as I was a leader by a half point going
into this game (I had 4/4 while he had 3.5/4). Unfortunately for myself, I
failed to capitalize on a large advantage and was duly punished.} 1. d4 Nf6 2.
c4 g6 3. g3 c5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bg2 Qa5+ 6. Nc3 Ne4 7. Qd3 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Nc5 9. Qd1
Nc6 10. e3 Ne6 11. O-O O-O 12. Nxe6 dxe6 13. Bd2 Qb6 {Not a square I'd
recommend for the queen, since Rb1-b4 is a nice idea for White anyway, but it's
tough to recommend clear improvements.} (13... Bd7 {would probably be my
choice, just trying to finish development.}) 14. Rb1 Rd8 15. Qe2 Ne5 16. Rfd1
Qc7 17. b3 a6 18. a4 Bd7 19. f4 Nc6 20. b4 {Black's position is quite cramped,
but it's not so terrible just yet.} Rac8 (20... a5 21. b5 Nb4 {is likely a
better choice, but I still like White's position.}) 21. Rdc1 Nb8 {[#] A sad
move to play, but Black is just trying to hang in there.} 22. a5 {Not a
terrible move, but not the one I wanted to play.} (22. b5 {was my intention,
but I missed something crucial at the end of the main line.} Qxc4 23. Bxb7 Qxe2
24. Nxe2 Rxc1+ 25. Rxc1 axb5 26. a5 $1 {The main idea.} Bc6 27. Bxc6 Nxc6 28.
Rxc6 Rxd2 29. Rc8+ Bf8 {and I thought Black was doing OK, but I missed that I
had} 30. Nc1 $1 {and the a-pawn will be nearly impossible to stop. Quite a
line!}) 22... Bc6 23. e4 Bd4+ 24. Be3 Be8 {Black's problem is that every piece
wants to use the c6 square. He's defending quite well, however, which makes my
life difficult.} 25. Nd5 Bxe3+ 26. Nxe3 Nc6 27. Qb2 b6 28. axb6 Qxb6 29. c5 Qb5
30. Bf1 Qb7 {Despite not being super accurate, I still have some edge here.
Unfortunately, I decided to lose my mind here.} 31. b5 {anti-positional
nonsense. I wanted to force the queens off, but this doesn't help in the least.
} (31. Nc4 {is the logical move, and after} Nd4 32. Bg2 {White still has some
advantage.}) 31... axb5 32. Qxb5 Qxb5 33. Bxb5 (33. Rxb5 {was the better
choice, but I was already off in the woods.}) 33... Nd4 {Vladimir doesn't miss
his chance.} 34. Ba6 Ra8 35. Bb7 Ra2 36. Rf1 Rb8 37. Rf2 Ra5 38. Rb4 Nc6 39.
Bxc6 Rxb4 40. Bxe8 Rxe4 {Since my crazy streak on move 31 I've defended
reasonably, but Belous continues to apply pressure.} 41. Ng4 Rxc5 42. Ne5 f6
43. Nf3 Kg7 44. Kg2 Re3 45. Bd7 Kf7 46. Ba4 h6 47. h4 {I wasn't crazy about
loosening g3, but allowing g5 seemed like the worse option.} Rcc3 48. Bd1 Kg7 {
Black wants e5.} 49. Rb2 e5 50. fxe5 fxe5 51. Kf2 e4 52. Nd2 (52. Ne5 {is a
stronger move which I didn't consider.} Rxg3 53. Re2 {followed by Rxe4 with a
likely draw.}) 52... Rxg3 {[#]} 53. Rb7 {A blunder ends the game immediately.}
(53. Nxe4 Rh3 54. Kg2 (54. Nxc3 Rh2+ 55. Kg3 Rxb2 {and I liked Black's chances
here with the rooks off.}) 54... Rcd3 55. h5 $1 {and White has good holding
chances.}) 53... e3+ {and I resigned, realizing that after Kxg3 he plays not
ed+ but e2+! Not the smoothest game, but Vladimir defended well and made the
most of the chances he got.} 0-1
