{Smirnov won the gold medal while Babarykin finished second to claim
the silver. Hence the duel between these two players in the fifth round
when both of them were on 4.0/4 was especially interesting.} 1. c4 e5

position from the reversed Sicilian. White is very comfortable in this
position and has just attacked the knight on c6. Babarykin doesn't really
have a good square for his knight apart from retreating it to a7 or b8.
But he had seen a combination and decided to go for it.} Nd4 $2 {At first
sight this looks like a strong move, but it turns out to be a big blunder.}

21. Re1 $1 {The queen is trapped.} Bxf3 22. Rxe2 Bxe2 23. f3 {The bishop
on e2 cannot be freed easily and White has a clear advantage.} Re5 24.
Re1 (24. Qxc7 $16) 24... Ra8 {Black resigned at this point because if
White takes the pawn on c7, his position is already quite bad.} 1-0
