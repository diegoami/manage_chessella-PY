Ra8 22. Rxa8 Qxa8 23. Nf5 Re8 24. b3 Bf8 25. bxc4 b4 {[#] The position looks quite clear after a brief glance, but this impression is deceptive. Black threatens to win the exchange with Ba4, but also Be4 is a threat. Finally, White must watch out for the further advance of the b4-pawn. From Black's point of view the question is whether White can manage to hold his extra pawn and consolidate an advantage in the long term. He must keep an eye on the knight on d7 and watch for threats to his king, especially on weak points at f7 and g7.
