{[A familiar situation - an almost equal ending has been reached, with black
having a slight disadvantage due to his 'bad' bishop. Carlsen has converted
many dozens of such endgame positions in his career, and he proceeds to do the
same here]} 20... Rc8 21. Rf1 Rc6 22. Rf3 Rb6 23. b3 Bb5 24. Bd1 Ra6 25. a4 Bd7
{[#]} 26. g4 $1 {[An important principle - the principle of two weaknesses.
White has to do a bit of 'nettlesome' play on the kingside - remember?!]} h6
27. h4 Rb6 28. Bc2 a5 29. Rf1 Rc6 30. Rb1 Rb6 31. Re1 Rc6 32. Rg1 Rc8 33. Bd3
Rc7 34. Rb1 Rc8 35. b4 {[#]} b6 $2 {[And finally Rapport cracks]} (35... axb4
36. Rxb4 Bc6 {offered much better chances of a defence}) 36. bxa5 bxa5 37. Rb7
{[This rook invasion is difficult to face in a blitz game - Carlsen wins the
game quite efficiently from hereon]} Kd8 38. Ra7 Rb8 39. Rxa5 Rb4 40. Ra8+ Kc7
