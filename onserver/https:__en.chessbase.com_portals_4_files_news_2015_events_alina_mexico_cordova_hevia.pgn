26. b4 $1 {The tournament winner's trademark, inspired pawn moves!} Rac8 ({
Obviously,} 26... c4 {or cxb4 run into} 27. Qb6) 27. Rc1 {A difficult
situation for Black: between the devil and the deep blue sea...} Qe5 (27...
cxb4 {is met by the same} 28. Qb6 {where the d6-pawn plays a more strategic
role than its white pale compensation that was taken on b4.}) 28. bxc5 dxc5 29.
Rxc5 Nf5 {Trying to mud the crystaline winning waters.} 30. Qc3 Qe7 31. Rxc8
Rxc8 32. Qb2 {Given the little time on the clock, this seemed to me the best
practical way to continue. What could be more tempting than controlling the
a1-h8 diagonal, followed soon by Bh3 and even mating ideas?} ({However, the
silicon valley shouts} 32. Qd2 {and after} Qc5+ 33. Rf2 {with no more threats,
pawn up and big advantage.}) 32... Ne3 33. Bh3 {Pretty grim for Black but
there was a good defensive idea; try to find it!} Qg5+ {was played, which was
not the winner ticket.} (33... Rc2 $1 {What follows in this line is quite
difficult to grasp and I will surely invest more time to properly comprehend
everything that my engine is suggesting. In practical play though and having
to make your moves on the 30 seconds increament, interesting things could have
happened had Black chosen for this mess.} 34. Qd4 Qg5+ 35. Kf2 Bc8 $1 36. Qxe3
Qh4+ 37. Kg1 Bxh3 38. Rd1 Rxa2 39. d6 Rc2 {These machines have zero fears!} 40.
Qb3+ (40. d7 {doesn't work} Bxd7 {and if} 41. Rxd7 Qe1+ {oups!}) 40... Rc4 41.
Ng3 Bd7 {Asses this if you can! (I would always choose White)} 42. e5 Qg5 43.
e6 Bxe6 44. d7 Qd8 {I am thouroughly enjoying the "only" moves that my
computer is throwing in! I must say I don't have the strongest laptop ever but
it gives an idea on how difficult to win a game became these days. At least we
play humans, which gives hopes:)}) 34. Kf2 Nxf1 35. Be6+ Kf8 36. Bxc8 {When
time is running out, the usual path to victory is to keep it simple, forget
about calculating sharp lines (if you can!).} ({Even stronger was} 36. Qh8+ Ke7
37. Qxh7+ Kd6 38. f4 ({or} 38. Qxb7) 38... Qd8 39. Qxb7 {And everything falls
apart, the knight on f1 is hanging, as well as the rook on c8 and the pawn on
a6, while the threat of e5 is floating in the air-->impossible for Black to
save his army.}) 36... Bxc8 37. Qh8+ Ke7 38. Qxc8 {Pawn up and close to
queening was more than enough for White to convert the advantage into a full
point.} 1-0
