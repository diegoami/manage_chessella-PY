41. Qd3 Nh2 {[#] Black has two powerful rooks on the second rank and threatens
to win immediately with 42...Nxf3+.} 42. Re7 {White counters the threat of 42..
.Nxf3+ with a counterattack. Le Quang Liem now has the right - drastic - idea
but fails to find the most precise continuation.} Qxc6 $6 {An imaginative and
powerful idea.} ({However, better and more precise was the stunning} 42... Bd4
$3 {[#] and White is helpless against the many threats.} 43. Nxd4 ({What else?
Black threatens to mate with discovered checks and} 43. Qxd4 $4 Nxf3+ 44. Kh1
Rh2# {also leads to mate.}) 43... Qxe7 $19 {Black is an exchange up and still
has a powerful attack.}) 43. dxc6 ({The engines indicate a cleaner way to a

check on d4 and now threatens to take on c7. Black's attack lost most of its
power and White is winning.}) 44. Qb3+ Kf8 {An absolutely amazing position:
White is a queen up but Black threatens to mate and the black king attacks
White's rook on e7.} 45. Kh1 Nxf3 46. Qxa2 Rxa2 47. Re2 {White has to return
material to parry the mating threat.} Rxe2 48. Bxd6+ Ke8 {Another creative
attempt to play for a win.} ({The obvious} 48... cxd6 49. Bg2 Re8 50. Bxf3 {
leads to an endgame with opposite-coloured bishops in which Black is a pawn up
but in which the passed c-pawn should guarantee White a draw.}) 49. Bg2 Ne1 50.
Bf1 Nd3 $8 {Continuing the tactics. However, Black no longer had much choice.
After} (50... Re3 51. Bxc7 $18 {material is equal and White wins with his
bishops and the passed c-pawn.}) 51. Bxe2 Nxc1 52. Ba6 Kd8 {The position seems
to have calmed down a bit: Black is a pawn up but White has the bishop pair
and seems to have good chances to save himself. But Maghsoodloo finds a way to
add fuel into fire.} 53. Bf4 ({Better and safer was} 53. Bf8) 53... Na2 54. Bc4
{Ein riskantes Man√∂ver vom Iraner.} Nxb4 55. Bf7 Nxc6 56. Bxg6 {White wins
the h-pawn but Black's passed pawns on the queenside are also very dangerous.}
Ne7 57. Bxh5 b5 58. Kg2 c5 59. Kf3 c4 {Here, Maghsoodloo had about a minute
left on the clock while Le had about eight minutes remaining.} 60. Bf7 Kd7 61.
