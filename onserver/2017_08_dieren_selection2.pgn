{A very good tournament for the Dutch IM Koen Leenhouts - shared 1st with
Sandipan, with 7/9! Perhaps the most important result for his performance was
the win in R8 against the top seed, Iturrizaga.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e6 4.

[%cal Rd8e7,Re7e5,Re5d4] Eduardo Iturrizaga is known to be a very resourceful
player and he plentifully showed us that (for example the game against Roeland
Pruijssers). This time though, using the same piece four moves in a row in the
ever sharp Benoni proved to be lethal. For himself.} 11. Bg5 Qe5 12. f4 Qd4 13.
