dxe5 9. fxe5 Nc6 10. e6 Nxd4 11. exf7+ Kxf7 12. Nxd4 Ne5 13. Qd2 $2 {We can
immediately see Black playing Qxd4 and then a discovered check with Nf3.} (13.
Be2 {In the beginning I don't use engines to analyze a game, I try to find the
moment where things went wrong. I feel this was probably the right move,
because it could bring the Rh1 into play immediately, while developing and
controlling better F3.} Qxd4 {Now this move doesn't work.} 14. Rf1+ Kg8 15.
Qxd4 Nf3+ 16. Rxf3 Bxd4 17. O-O-O $16 {Black has the Rh8 out of the game, and
the Ra8 blocked by the Bc8.}) 13... Qxd4 $1 14. Qxd4 Nf3+ {This game proves we
need to do our tactics every day!} 15. gxf3 Bxd4 16. Bc4+ Kg7 17. O-O-O Be3+ $6
{Very interesting, Black prefers to keep the bishop pair, than damage White's
pawn structure exchanging on C3.} (17... Bxc3 {With the knowledge from having
watched the entire game, also if Black won, I still think this move was more
appropriate to the needs of the position.} 18. bxc3 Bf5 19. Rhe1 Kf6 $15) 18.
Kb1 Bf5 19. Rde1 Bc5 20. Ne4 Rac8 {Now Black accept the idea of losing the
bishop pair, but tries to gain activity for his rooks on an open file. The Ra8
was out of the game for 20 moves, so it makes sense.} 21. Nxc5 Rxc5 22. Rxe7+
Kf6 23. Rf7+ Kg5 {Steinitz: the king is a powerful piece. Repeat this mantra
20 times a day!} 24. Bd3 Bxd3 25. cxd3 Rf5 26. Rxb7 a5 27. Rd1 Kf4 28. d4 Rd5

tactic in the endgame.} 47. Rxd7 h1=Q 48. Rf7+ Kg3 49. Kxa5 Qxf3 {Now that the
game is over, one should return to the beginning and analyze it with an engine,
to see what was missed, and if one's own analysis are correct.} 0-1
