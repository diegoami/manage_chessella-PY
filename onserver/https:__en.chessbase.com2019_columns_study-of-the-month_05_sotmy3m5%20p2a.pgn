{Of course, this classical miniature is one of my favorites. It demonstrates
castling as an attacking move, similar to what is found in some endgame
studies. Tartakower, seemingly winning a piece, soon finds that his opponent
has prepared a deadly double-check.} 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6
5. Qd3 e5 $2 {This move is a serious mistake, but one can only see that if he
already sees the checkmate.} 6. dxe5 Qa5+ ({Yes, technically the game still
would be playable after exchanging the queens. But if that is what you
sacrifice a central pawn for, you give up all winning chances and just have to
fight for a draw against an opponent who can decide if he rather wants a
positional or material advantage.} 6... Qxd3 7. cxd3 $5 (7. Bxd3 Nxe4 8. Bxe4

{The rest of the games is given without further analysis. Here Réti manages to

would have lost at least one rook for a knight.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. b4 Bg7

I would have tried} 31. R1d5 Nc4 32. Rxc5 Nxb2 {but objectively White wins,

exchange up, the game is won. Of course, on the world-class level the both
opponents played at, they surely saw those additional few forced moves, while
that might not have been the case at the much lower playing level of your
author and his usual opponents. This interestingly shows in your author's
opinion the difference between when masters and when more casual players
should resign.}) 1-0

{This game is a real curiosity, as Réti played 14.-Bg4 against Paul Krueger
1914 and won by sacrificing both rooks. So it is possible that Euwe, who had a
similar game already in the same year as this one (1920) with White against
Kroone (with 11.-Bc5 instead of 11.-Qc5) was prepared, but outprepared by Réti.
The previous games were pointed out as a discussion comment on another big
online chess database website by Geoff Chandler, Scotland, using a pseudonyme
in 2014.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. O-O Nxe4 6. Re1 d5 7.
