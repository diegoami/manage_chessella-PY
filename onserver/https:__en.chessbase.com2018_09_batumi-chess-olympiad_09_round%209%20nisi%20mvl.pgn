1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 Ng4 {MVL mainly
plays this move nowadays against English attack. It is not a difficult task to
predict what MVL might play in the opening but it is challenging to out
prepare him. Things get more difficult to actually win the game even after out
preparing him as he is very tricky and able to swindle from difficult
situations. In this game Dieter managed to do both. First out prepared him and
then once he got advantage he kept control over the game throughout.} 7. Bg5 h6
8. Bc1 Nf6 {That is modern chess nowadays! After playing three consecutive
moves with same piece and getting it back to its initial square all white has
achieve is now the black pawn is placed on h6 instead of h7. In pre-computer
era such moves would have been considered as coffeehouse chess but thanks to
strong computers our perspective has changed a lot and we now see such lines
at top level. Is h6 is a weakness or a useful move? That depends on which
setup white is going to take next. For instance, if he plays now Be2 then
black will play e5 and surely then h6 will be useful as it stops Bg5.
Basically, now if black can play e5 without concession then h6 is useful. If
he has to play e6 then the debate will be on if h6 can be called as a
potential weakness in future for kingside attack.} 9. Bc4 {The most popular
follow up which makes a lot of sense as it practically forces black to opt for
e6 setup. White can now try to prove that h6 can be a target.} (9. Bd3 {
Grischuk played this twice. Once against Duda in online blitz and and once
against MVL at Moscow GP 2017.} e5 (9... Nc6 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. O-O {0-1 (45)

12. Nxc6 $5 $146 {Completely new direction. All the games that reached this
position saw 12.f4. Judging by the time consumed I would guess this was cooked
over the board.} bxc6 13. Qf3 {Such things would not have worked with the pawn
on h7 as then black can simply castle without fearing any kind of kingside
attack.} Qc7 $6 {A natural reaction for stopping e5 but it is due to this
innocent looking move black king will now lack a safe place for rest of the
game. It was time to bite the bullet and simply castle on kingside.} (13... O-O
$1 {It does look a bit like inviting white for a quick kingside attack and
hence so not easy to take this decision over the board. Even with the engines
on I feel a bit skeptical about this whole process.} 14. g4 (14. O-O-O d5 {
[%cal Ga6a4,Ge7b4] Black has his own way to create a quick counter play.})

require much depth to draw any conclusion. Numbers are 0.00 which doesn't mean
much in a practical game but at least it shows that black is not getting
crushed through.}) 15... Bb4 16. exd5 exd5 17. g5 Bg4 (17... Ng4 $5 {also
doable}) 18. Qg2 Bh5 $1 19. gxf6 Qxf6 {gives black great compensation}) 14. Qg3

black from now on. Where to put the king?} Bb7 (14... Kf8 $14 {Top choice of
machine but for sure no one would like to play like this}) 15. O-O-O {Dieter
plays most natural move. Black is unable to run to queenside now as then white
can take on g7 and f7 will be hanging next. Computer insists that white could
actually have just started to collect some pawns without fearing any counter
attack by black.} (15. Qxg7 $1 Rg8 16. Qxh6 O-O-O 17. O-O-O c5 (17... d5 18.

better from every other aspect.} Rxh6 19. Bxh6 c5 20. e5 {Dieter switches his
play from direct attack to slow strategic play. There were faster and stronger

better structure and with black's center broken there are no more pawn rolling
ideas to be worried about.} Nd5 23. Bd2 {Once again Dieter choses the most
solid approach. Not to create any weakness and play simply for black's
weaknesses} (23. Qg8 {Engine way} Nxc3 24. bxc3 {[%cal Gh6g5]} Qe7 25. Be3 {
I personally would also have not opted for this line even though it gives huge
advantage.}) 23... Kb8 24. Qg8 (24. Na4 Ka7 25. Qg7 $1 {Queen on g7 is better

important square 'd3' and 'd1' which were essential to give any kind of
