{A game of blitz can make you do many illogical things for which you would have
no explanation. For example, in this perfectly fine position, one of the best
blitz players of our generation blunders an entire rook.} 30. Rd6 $4 {But why?}
Rxd6 {There is just no reason. Maybe he thought the e8 rook was undefended or
he just saw that Rxe4 was not possible because the queen would be hanging. Such
oversights happen all the time in blitz.} 0-1
