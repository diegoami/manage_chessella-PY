{I liked a lot my play in this game, up to this point at least and except some
earlier decisions. I wish I would play correct games from start to end but I
need more work for that and better nerves. For now, Black was suddenly sitting
on a gold mine, given my terrible previous move. So how would you continue?} 
31... Bf3 {was played, to my relief.} ({But} 31... Ne3 {would have brought
Black not only half a point but I would say a full one in fact. I was playing
on the 30 seconds increment and I remember telling myself that if this would
appear on the board, I would go:} 32. Rg1 {which loses immediately!} (32. fxe3

such a slippery game, one mistake and it's all over.}) 32. Ne4 {back in

events and R7 was no exception.} 19. g5 {was regretted further on by White.

piece down but with promising perspectives} Qa5 {allows White the chance to

the compensation for the piece} 24. Qa4 a5 {Have fun analyzing this position

who holds 4 GM norms already and only the rating is keeping her away from the
highest title. I would say she will reach that, judging by her strive to win
at all costs. Draw is almost never an option and I admire that! Some would
call it lack of objectivity, others would find different adjectives but
success comes to those who dare. IMO.} 0-1

if the 1st move is rather obvious, go as deep as you can, it helps your
