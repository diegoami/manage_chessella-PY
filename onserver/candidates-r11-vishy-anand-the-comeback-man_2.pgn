cxd4 9. exd4 Be7 10. Be3 (10. Qe2 {followed by Rd1 was played by Nakamura
against Svidler.}) 10... O-O 11. Qe2 Nb4 12. Ne5 {No real top player has played
this way. So it is possible that Aronian came up with this idea on his own at
home, because he was playing pretty fast.} Bd7 13. Rad1 Nbd5 14. Bc1 { Making
way for the rook lift from d3 to the kingside.} Bc6 15. Rd3 Nxc3 16. bxc3 Bd5
17. Rg3 Bxc4 18. Nxc4 g6 19. Ne5 {White has got his pieces in an attacking and
aggressive position, but unfortunately they do not look so threatening because
of the missing light squared bishop.} Nd7 20. Bh6 Re8 21. f4 Bf8 22. Bg5 Be7
23. Ng4 $1 h5 24. Bxe7 {Levon chooses the practical approach. But there was a
chance for him to launch a nearly decisive attack.} ( 24. Nh6+ Kg7 (24... Kf8
25. f5 $3 exf5 26. Qc4 $18) 25. h4 $5 {This was discussed by the players in the
press conference and it definitely looks like a strong move.} (25. Bxe7 Qxe7

moves like f5 and Nxf7 looks pretty strong.}) 24... Qxe7 25. Ne5 $14 {White is
definitely slightly better, but the worst seems to have ended for Black.} Kh7

34... Rhc8 35. Rb5 Rxb5 36. axb5 Qa3 {At this point it would have been wise to
take on g6 and just agree to a draw, but instead, out of inertia, Levon tries
to continue and gets into a perilious situation.} 37. Qc2 Rb8 38. Qe2 Qc1+ 39.
Kf2 Qxf4+ 40. Kg1 Qc1+ 41. Kf2 Qf4+ 42. Kg1 { Peter was quite confused whether
to continue or make a draw. But when he saw the move Kg8, he decided to give it
a go.} Kg8 43. Qb2 a6 $1 44. c4 axb5 45. c5 Qe4 46. Qd2 Qb1+ 47. Kf2 Ra8 48.

the World Championship Match look pretty slim now.} 0-1
