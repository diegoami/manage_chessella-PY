64... Rxf4 (64... Rxf4 {And here my opponent resigned. And it seemed like the
right move. After all, she was two pawns down and Black had everything in
order. Surprisingly, and much to my disbelief this position turns out to be a
draw.}) 65. Ra2 $1 {The precise move to hold the draw. I cannot} (65. Kg3 $2 {

way to win and a logical one. Black will play Rg3+ and get his king to g4.
This works because the rook is on c2 and the checking distance is not so huge.
If the rook were on a2, this would not work.} (66... Kd3 $2 {like in the game

my findings of this rook endgame. I would really be interested if someone has
something more to add to it and is able to find a win for Black. As far as I
could analyze and also work with Tigran Gharamian after the tournament, we
came to the conclusion that the game was drawn.} *
