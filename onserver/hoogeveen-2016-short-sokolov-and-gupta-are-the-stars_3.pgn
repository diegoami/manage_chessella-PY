1. d4  Nf6  2. Nf3  e6  3. Bf4 {[%emt 0:00:05] Sandipan has been playing the
London system quite regularly recently.} c5  4. e3  d5  5. c3  Nc6  6. Nbd2 
Bd6 {[%emt 0:00:07] This is the recommended way for Black to play. Simple and
sound development. However, it seems as if White is coming out on top in many
of the games. Let's see how Chanda plays here.} 7. Bg3  O-O  8. Bd3  b6  9. Qe2
 Bb7  10. O-O  Rc8  11. a3  Ne7  12. Bxd6  Qxd6  13. Ne5 {[%emt 0:00:08] The
position is round about equal. The bishop on d3 seems better than the bishop on
b7, but, soon we will soon see something quite paradoxical.} Ne4  14. Nxe4 
dxe4  15. Ba6 {[%emt 0:00:08] With the bishop exchange White hopes to exploit
Black's queenside weaknesses.} Bxa6  16. Qxa6  Qc7  17. f3  f6  18. Ng4  h5 $1 
19. Nf2  exf3  20. gxf3  Nd5 {[%emt 0:00:54] With powerful moves Black has
taken over the initiative.} (20... c4 $5 {was also pretty strong.}) 21. Qe2  e5
$6  (21... cxd4 $1 22. exd4 (22. cxd4 Qc2 $17) 22... Nf4 $15) 22. c4 $1  Ne7 
23. d5 {[%emt 0:00:32] White is now better because of the passer.} Nf5  24. Ne4
 Nd6  25. Kh1  Nxe4  26. fxe4 {[%emt 0:01:53] Suddenly the move h5 which was
excellent when it was played, turns into a weakness.} g6  27. Rf3  Qh7 28. Raf1
Kg7  29. h4  Rc7  30. Qf2  Rcf7  31. Qg3 Kh8  32. Kh2  Qh6  33. Qh3  Qg7  34.
Qe6  Kh7  35. d6  a5  36. R1f2  Kh6  37. Kg1  g5 $2 { [%emt 0:01:43] completely
impatient. Black was worse but this just hastens the end.} 38. hxg5+  Qxg5+ 
39. Rg2  Qh4  40. d7  Qxe4  41. Qxf7 { [%emt 0:02:28] The London system didn't
give White any advantage. In fact Lalith showed the best way for Black to play
against it, but in the middlegame he went wrong and Chanda was pretty much
ruthless.} 1-0
