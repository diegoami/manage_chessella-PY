f4 {The four pawns sets up a huge centre but White is making a big commitment
by playing four pawn moves out of his first five.} O-O 6. Nf3 Na6 7. e5 $5 {
The most aggressivve choice but asking a lot of the position.} Nd7 {[#] I
found about 100 games here in a contemporary database of just under 2.5
million. Be2 is most common followed by h4. c5 would be nice if White could
get control but he's a tempo short.} 8. c5 ({I really wanted to play the crude
} 8. h4 {But in contrast to the the Austrian Attack against the Pirc (where
White hasn't played c4) Black has an extra tempo so it perhaps shouldn't be
too surprising that Black is doing quite well if he plays sufficiently
accurately.} c5 9. d5 dxe5 10. h5 {Here exf4 has normally been played but
engines suggest:} Qa5 $5 11. Kf2 (11. hxg6 fxg6 12. Bd3 e4 13. Bxe4 Bxc3+ 14.
bxc3 Nf6 15. Bc2 Qxc3+ 16. Bd2 Qxc4 {is a natural line in which White has
practical chances but must be seriously worse in theory.}) (11. Bd2 {looks
better than Kf2 perhaps then}) 11... Qb6) (8. Be2 c5 9. exd6 exd6 10. d5 {
with a Benoni in which f4 rather gets in White's way.} (10. O-O)) 8... dxc5 9.
d5 $6 {By sacrificing the c pawn, White has taken the pressure off e5 for the
moment. If he had one more tempo, then he might have been able to keep control
with a good position but you have to ask whether it's "reasonable" that White
can play so many pawn moves in the opening and the theoretical answer seems to
be that he's overdone it and so is unable to keep control.} (9. Bxa6 bxa6 10.
Be3 cxd4 11. Qxd4 {Here White keeps his centre for the moment and while I
instinctively prefer Black, engines think White is OK too.}) 9... Nb6 (9... f6
{was interesting since if} 10. e6 Nb6 11. f5 Nb4 {and White falls apart well
before Black.}) 10. Bxa6 (10. a3 {was a thought to prevent Nb4 but} Bg4 11. h3
Bxf3 12. Qxf3 f6 13. e6 (13. exf6 Bxf6 14. Bd2 Bxc3 (14... c4 15. Rd1 Nc5 {
is a more ambitious way for Black to play.}) 15. Bxc3 Qxd5 {gives White some
play for the two or rather perhaps one and a half pawns}) 13... f5 {with d5
caving in White is in trouble.} 14. Bd2 Qd6 ({even} 14... Bxc3 15. Bxc3 Qxd5 {
is pretty good.})) 10... bxa6 11. Be3 Bb7 12. Bxc5 Nxd5 {[#]} 13. Qb3 $2 {
Up to here, White has taken some risks but remained within bounds. However,
this is a blunder after which Black is much better or even "winning with best
play".} ({Instead} 13. Nxd5 Bxd5 (13... Qxd5 14. Qxd5 Bxd5 15. Kf2 {can't be
too bad for White.}) 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 (14... Bxf3 15. Qxd8 Rfxd8 16. Bxd8 Bxg2 17.
Rg1 $16) 15. Qxd5 Rfd8 16. Qc4 Rab8 17. O-O {was a reasonable way for White to
bail out.}) 13... Nxf4 $1 14. Rd1 ({Of course if} 14. Qxb7 Nd3+ 15. Ke2 (15.
Kf1 Nxc5) 15... Nxc5 (15... Rb8 {is also strong} 16. Qc6 Nxe5 17. Nxe5 Rxb2+ {
with a huge attack.})) 14... Nxg2+ 15. Kf2 Qc8 $1 {The only move but perfectly
sufficient.} 16. Nd5 Bxd5 {It's a shame for Black that he has to give up the
beautiful bishop but the position should be winning anyway.} 17. Qxd5 Nf4 18.
Qd7 Qb7 19. b4 Rfe8 (19... f6 20. e6 Qe4 {was strong becuse if} 21. Rhe1 Nh3+ {
but this requires exact calculation and Goran very sensibly kept his position
together and allowed White to fall apart.}) 20. Bxe7 Bf8 21. Bxf8 Rxf8 {
Goran played very sensibly around here maintaining his advantage without
trying too hard to demonstrate anything forced.} 22. h4 Qb6+ 23. Kg3 Nh5+ 24.
Kg2 Qxb4 25. Rd4 Qb2+ 26. Rd2 Qc3 27. Rf1 Rab8 28. Rff2 Nf4+ 29. Kg3 Ne6 30.
Qe7 Qb4 31. Qf6 h5 32. Kh2 Qg4 33. Rf1 (33. Rg2 Qf4+ 34. Qxf4 Nxf4 {is also
quite lost but a slightly less bad version than than White actually got.})
33... Rb4 34. Rg2 Qf4+ 35. Qxf4 (35. Qxf4 {Again not trying too hard but
trusting in his technique to get him over the line.}) 35... Rxf4 36. Kg3 Rd8
37. Rgf2 Rd3 38. Kg2 c5 {With 3 (or perhaps 2.5) extra pawns and every piece
more active than its counterpart, Black is obviously totally winning.} 39. Rb1
Rb4 40. Rc1 {[#]} Kg7 {Reaching the time control. Quiet improving moves are
often the most unpleaant to face when you're lost.} 41. Kh2 c4 42. Rcf1 c3 43.

fxe6 50. R6f4 e5 51. Rh4 Rd2 {And White resigned. After a fierce opening
battle, Goran went from a small edge to a winning position when his opponent
blundered with Qb3?. He then wrapped things up very effectively, making life
utterly miserable for his opponent by refusing to rush things or enter into
even the most harmless of complications.} 0-1
