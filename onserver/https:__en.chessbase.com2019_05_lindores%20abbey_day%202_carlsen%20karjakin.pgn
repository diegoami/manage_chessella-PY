the game from this point onwards. It seems like the game would end in a draw.}

(21... dxe4 22. Bxe4 Rd8 {gives Black a safe and stable position, but Karjakin
tries for something more dynamic.}) 22. exd5 $6 {From the spectator point of
view, this was a great move. However, objectively this looks bad.} (22. bxa4)

position? White has just two minor pieces for the queen. But what he has is
this clump of pawns on the queenside.} Be5 (27... fxe6 28. Bxb7 Bd4 29. Nc4

told this is also a drawn position.}) 30... Bxe3 31. Nxe3 Qb2 (31... Qa5 $5 {
was a powerful move because it attacks the queenside pawns. And this c5 pawn
is much more critical than the b3 pawn that Karjakin won in the game.} 32. Bc6+
(32. Ba6 Qa2 33. Kg2 Qxb3 34. c6 Kd8 {White has managed to keep his pawn duo
but the bishop is out of play on a6.}) 32... Kd8 $1 33. Nc4 Qb4 $19 {White is
unable to hold on to his c5 pawn.}) 32. Kg2 Qxb3 33. b6 Qb5 34. Bf3 Kd8 $1 {
Karjakin plays carefully.} (34... Qxc5 35. b7 Qb5 36. Nc2 Qb6 37. Nd4 Qa7 {
This knight and bishop duo can be quite potent here. White can even win this
and Black has to be careful.}) 35. b7 Kc7 36. c6 {Although engines feel that
this is better for Black, during the game being inside the tournament hall, I
felt like it was Magnus who was playing for a win. Objectively this should be
drawn because I don't think Black has anyway to just make progress with his
queen.} Qb4 37. g4 Qd4 38. Nf1 h5 39. gxh5 gxh5 40. Ng3 e5 41. Ne4 Qc4 42. Ng5

49. Ng3 {It was a thrilling game with both players showing skills at a very
high level. Of course mistakes did happen, but when you have around 10-20
seconds on the clock, the quality of play that was shown by Magnus and Sergey
was not at all bad.} 1/2-1/2
