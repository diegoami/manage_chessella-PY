Rxc5 Rxf7 61. Bxb2 axb2 62. Rb5+ Kc6 63. Rxb2) 54... Ke6 {[#] And here it
happened. Guy picked up his pawn to promote it and, not seeing a queen to hand,
did what everybody has done in blitz games since time immemorial: put it on f8,
said "queen", and hit the clock. Unfortunately, this is not allowed under the
rules (incidentally, if you turn a rook upside down and say "queen" then it is
a rook, and when you attempt to move it as a queen you've made an illegial move).
His opponent called over the tournament director - who ideally should have
been there with a queen in his hand for Guy - and, in accordance with the FIDE
rules, the TD awarded the IM, who at that stage had 12 seconds left, an extra
two minutes. What Guy should have done is to stop the clock and go and find a
queen or scream for one, but he didn't know thisb and I'm not a great fan of
this rule anyway, since I feel that once you're effectively playing blitz
there should be some latitude - maybe a warning rather than an actual penalty.
I've also fallen foul of the rule myself at least once in a tournament blitz
game (happily at a time when your opponent got an extra two minutes rather
than winning instantly as under the previous rule). There have also been a few
high profile games where somebody has queened illegally and their opponent has
claimed a win. In any case, Guy was now fatally behind on the clock and his
opponent, rated more than 350 points above him, gained a rather Pyrrhic
victory.} 55. f8=Q Bxf8 56. Rxf8 b2 $2 (56... Kxe5 $1 57. Ng4+ Ke6 58. Nxf2 b2

Kf7 58. Rb8 {was winning.}) 57... Kxe5 58. Kxf2 a3 59. Nd5 a2 60. Rxb2 {[#] And
in this drawn position Guy lost on time. What a shame, after he had fought his
way back from an abysmal opening to reach a winning position and would
presumably have at least drawn had it not been for a technicality.} 0-1
