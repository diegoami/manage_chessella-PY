{This game hides a couple of interesting, tactical and positional sacrifices,
starting with:} 25. Rxd3 $1 {where Black was hoping to get the initiative after
} exd3 26. Qxd3 Re4 27. a5 Rfe8 28. Rf1 Re1 29. g3 R1e2 30. a6 R8e3 $1 {which
indeed happened and White collapsed under pressure; but he did have a very
strong counter-move!} 31. Qxf5 ({Instead,} 31. Ne7+ $1 {would have not only
saved White but would have also brought him advantage.} Rxe7 ({If} 31... Qxe7 {
then} 32. fxe3 {is possible, as the Qxg3 threat is no longer valid.}) ({In
case of} 31... Kf7 32. Qxf5+ Kxe7 {and} 33. Qg5+ {with a winning position.})
32. a7 Re8 33. Qxe2 Rxe2 34. a8=Q+ Kf7 {White is a pawn up but quite some work
needs to be done to convert the advantage. I don't think it is actually
winning, yet it was certainly preferable to what happened in the game.  White
missed that after:}) 31... Rxg3+ 32. Kh1 g6 $1 {is forcing the white lady to
stop protecting the d5-pawn.} 0-1
