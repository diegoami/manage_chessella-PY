an unfairly bad rep.} 9. axb5 axb5 10. c3 d6 11. d4 {for instance and now
Black can consider ...Rb6-a6 with decent equalising chances.}) (8... Bb7 {
is possible, and now the interest in} 9. d3 d6 10. Nc3 $5 {may have been
sparked by...Caruana,F-Adams,M Gibraltar 2007 (!)}) (8... Na5 9. axb5 Nxb3 10.
cxb3 d5 $14 {is not stupid, but Black doesn't quite get enough compensation
against good play.}) 9. d4 d6 10. dxe5 {Trying to play 'safely but for a win',
but as every Russian schoolboy knows, there is play in even the driest of
endgames.} Nxe5 11. Nxe5 dxe5 12. Qxd8 (12. Qe2 {was an equally unsuccessful
earlier experiment.} a5 13. Bg5 Ba6 14. Qf3 h6 15. Rd1 $2 (15. Be3 Bd6 16. Nd2

had great play for the material in Giri,A-Aronian,L Leuven 2018}) 12... Rxd8
13. Nd2 Bc5 14. Nf3 Bb7 {A novelty as far as I can see, but presumably one
Jones prepared against.} (14... Ng4 {is absolutely the most natural move for
me.} 15. Be3 Bxe3 16. fxe3 Rd6 17. Rad1 Be6 18. Bxe6 Rxe6 $11 {Robson,R-So,W

Kf1 (16. Be3 $5 Bd5 17. Bxd5 Rxd5 18. Nc6 {could be something, because the
b4-pawn is loose.}) 16... Kf8 $1 17. a5 Bd4 $6 {This could be inaccurate.} (

for a human it is not immediately obvious the rook doesn't get trapped:} 18.

level here.}) 18. Nxf7 Rd7 19. Ng5 $1 Nxg5 20. Bxg5 Bxb2 21. Rad1 (21. Be3 $1
Bxa1 (21... Bd4 22. Bxd4 Rxd4 23. Re5 $16) 22. Bc5+ Rd6 23. Rxa1 {seems to be
a definite plus for White, because all of Black's pawns on the queenside will
be weak.}) 21... Rxd1 22. Rxd1 Bc6 $1 {Now Black gets back into the battle for
supremacy.} 23. Bf4 Bb5+ 24. Kg1 Rc8 {Bd6 would have been a big check.} 25. Rd5

followed by ...Bd8 is the machine idea, because it is confident White can't
land a meaningful Re5+.}) 29. h3 c6 30. Rf5 Bd4 31. Bc7 (31. Be5 {was White's
chance to be only slightly worse, but the keyboard warriors saying Gawain lost
his way completely here have it wrong, because it's not obvious that after} g6

lose the pawn in almost as bad a way as in the game.}) 31... Rd7 32. Bb6 Bxb6

analysts than me will unpick what follows, but I deem it appropriate to stop
commentary here.} 34. c4 bxc3 35. Rc5 Rxb6 36. Rxc3 a5 37. f4 a4 38. Ba2 Rb7
