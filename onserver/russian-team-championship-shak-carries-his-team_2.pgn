1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Qa4+ { A
modestly popular sideline. White aims to interfere with Black's usual procedure
of ...c5, ...Nc6, ...Bg4 etc.} Qd7 ({Also possible is} 7... Nd7 {
Riazantsev-Nepo, 2015 saw} 8. Nf3 c5 9. Be2 O-O 10. O-O a6 11. Qa3 Qc7 12. e5 {
White seems to be doing the right thing, except for keeping his Queen out of
play.} b6 13. Bg5 Re8 14. h4 Bb7 15. h5 b5 {0-1(48)}) 8. Qxd7+ {Trading queens
this early is kind of lame.} ({Some 12 years ago Swiss GM Vadim Milov
introduced} 8. Qb3 {and it is still intriguing:} O-O 9. Nf3 c5 10. d5 e6 { I
don't see what this move is going to accomplish, except for making White's
d5-pawn into a passer.} ({I'd try} 10... Qc7 11. Be2 Nd7 12. O-O Ne5 {aiming
for c5-c4.}) 11. Be3 exd5 12. exd5 b6 13. Bb5 Qd6 14. O-O Bd7 15. a4 $14 {

c5 $1) 9... b6 10. Nf3 c5 11. Be3 O-O 12. Bd3 Nc6 13. O-O {
Mastrovasilis-Istratescu, 2016. White may have a little bit of something here,
as Bd7 is out of position.}) 9. Be3 (9. Bc4 c5 10. Ne2 {can be tried next time.
I like the flexibility of Ne2, and White can use his f-pawn to influence the
center.}) 9... O-O 10. Rc1 Rd8 11. Nf3 b6 12. Bd3 Bb7 13. Ke2 e5 14. Rhd1 Rac8
{[#] Some standard moves have been played, and White is looking for a plan of
campaign.} 15. d5 $6 {That is certainly not it.} (15. h3 $5 c5 $2 16. d5 {
would be a different story, as Black no longer has any counterplay.}) 15... c6
$1 16. c4 Bf8 $1 17. Kf1 $2 {This would be a perfect moment for White to strike
with f2-f4, but his pieces are not positioned for that. Still, the king retreat
is incredibly passive.} (17. g4 $5 {and try for something.}) ({Else, White
could consider} 17. a4 f6 18. a5) 17... f6 18. Be2 Nc5 19. Nd2 Na4 20. Nb1 f5
$1 {Shak is not going to sit there idly.} 21. Bg5 (21. f3 Bb4 22. Kg1 Ba6 ({Now
White is ready for} 22... Nb2 23. Rf1) 23. Rc2 cxd5 24. exd5 Rc7 25. a3 Bd6

has the energetic} 23. d6 $1 Rxd6 24. Rxd6 Bxd6 25. c5 {leaving the opponent
with a collection of weak pawns, albeit two of those are extra pawns!} ) 22.

25. Bg5 Bxc1 26. Rxc1 dxc3 27. Bxd8 Rxd8 28. exf5 gxf5 29. Rxc3 { The actrive
rook on the 3rd rank, and a possibility of c4-c5 help White maintain balance.})
21... Rd7 22. dxc6 $2 {Surrendering the center is a depressing choice.} (22.
exf5 gxf5 23. g4 $1 {represented Riazantsev's last chance to fight on equal
terms.}) 22... Rxd1+ 23. Bxd1 Bxc6 24. exf5 gxf5 25. Nc3 Nxc3 26. Rxc3 Bd5 27.

reminds me of Kramnik-Mamedyarov from Shamkir just a week ago: White's
desperate attempt at counterplay produces some fireworks, but ultimately
fizzles out, as Black's passer is just too strong.} Be6 37. Bc1 Rb8 $1
{Accurately calculated.} 38. Bxe6+ Kxe6 39. Rc3 (39. Rb3 Rxb3 40. axb3 Kxf6
