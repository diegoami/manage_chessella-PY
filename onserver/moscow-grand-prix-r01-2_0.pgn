{[#]} 17... Nd5 18. Ba5+ Bb6 {There is no doubt that White is better. He has
the pair of bishops and a safer king. Yeah, there is no immediate win or
anything, but why not play on?} 19. Bxd5 (19. Be1 {and Black will have to
suffer for a while to make his draw.}) 19... Rxd5 20. Rxd5 cxd5 21. Bc3 g5 {
Black has really survived the worse and the endgame is probably equal.} 22. Rd1
