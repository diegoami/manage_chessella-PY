c4 {A fascinating line, introduced to modern chess by Garry Kasparov. Both
sides are struggling with awkward positions of their queens that causes some
development issues.} Ba6 9. Nd2 g6 10. b3 {Theory doesn't look kindly to this
move. I suppose Pentala wanted to surprise his opponent.} ({On} 10. Nf3 { Black
has a choice of acceptable continuations.} Qb4+ (10... Nb6 11. b3 Bg7 12. Bg5

problem with the knight that plagues Black in this opening.}) 11... O-O 12. Qb2
{This isn't a novelty, but it had never been tried on GM level.} ({The
careless} 12. Bg5 {would land White in trouble:} f6 13. exf6 Qc5 $1 14. O-O-O
Rxf6 $3 {with raging attack on the dark squares near the white king.}) ({while
} 12. Bb2 {proves totally ineffective after} f6 $1) 12... Nb6 13. Qa3 {A new
idea.} Qxa3 14. Bxa3 Rfe8 15. O-O-O Bxe5 16. Nxe5 Rxe5 17. Bb2 {This is White
has been playing for. At the cost of a pawn he obtained the bishop pair, while
leaving Black's minor pieces stuck on the Q-side. Kasparov used similar ideas,
but he would keep his king out of action rather safely tucked in on the K-side.
} Re7 18. h4 d5 $1 {Evgeny's timely counterattack in the center exposes the
weakness of White's position. Essentually White is fighting for equality here.}
19. h5 dxc4 20. Rh4 Rae8 21. hxg6 fxg6 22. bxc4 {I bet Pentala didn't want to
play this move, but he hardly had any choice.} ({On} 22. a4 {Black begins to
make threats with} Re1 $1 {forcing} 23. Bc3 (23. a5 c3 $1) 23... Rxd1+ 24. Kxd1

trade down into an opposite-color bishop ending,} 24. Ba3 Rd4 25. Rxd4 cxd4 26.

cannot possibly lose.}) 24... Bb7 25. Rg4 {Hari must have had dreams of mating
Black. White just a bit short of firepower to do that.} ({Once again,} 25. Ba3
Bxg2 26. Bxc5 Bf3 27. Rd2 Red8 28. Be3 {and White shouldn't lose.}) 25... Bc6 {
Tomashevsky just being Tomashevsky: a solid positional play backed up by
accurate calculation of all possible tactics White might initiate.} 26. Rh1
Red8 27. Rh3 ({Both players must have looked at} 27. Bf5 Rd2+ 28. Kc1 Bd7 $1 {
and concluded Black comes out on top after} 29. Rxg6+ hxg6 30. Rh8+ Kf7 31.

Black will stay a pawn ahead.}) 29... Bd7 30. g4 {[#]} h5 $6 {This just isn't
good enough.} ({Black had} 30... g5 $1 {and no, Bxh7 isn't mate! In fact, it

bailout. Pieces will quickly dissappear from the board leaving Black only with
marginal winning chances.} ({Black would keep his advantage in} 31... Re8 32.
