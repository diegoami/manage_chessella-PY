For some reason, this Zviaginsev-espoused line hasn't attracted the cult
following of the related Glek line, which involves the same fianchetto with
the king's knight on e2 instead.} Nf6 4. d3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. c4 {This is some

This makes the game interesting, but I believe White has an advantage here
with best play.} (10... Nc5 $11 {is extremely comfortable for Black. White had

White has to resort to ideas like this 'not to resign immediately', to quote
Svidler. The point of course is that to force ...c6 through, Black must either
trade queens or weaken the long diagonal.} b6 {A very human move.} (17... Kh8 {
is given an astronomical -3.7 by Stockfish, presumably because the 22.Bxd5 of
the game will no longer give check, and White lacks a useful waiting move. The
