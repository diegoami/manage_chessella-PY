Raymond Song's opening versatility in this tournament was commendable.} 8. a4 (

moves with the c1-bishop}) 8... Bd7 9. Qxc4 (9. Ne5 Nc6 $1 (9... Bc6 10. Nxc6

bishop-pair. It is important to note the wrinkle} c5 13. dxc5 Rc8 14. b4 $1 $14

bishop-pair, when we consider the short-term factors.}) 9... Bc6 10. Bf4 Bd6
11. Qc1 $1 ({A recent elite game went:} 11. Bg5 Nbd7 12. Nc3 h6 13. Bc1 {
Even the official commentary stream was powerless to explain this move, which
seems to rely on considerations that are so long-term as to be practically
non-existent.} (13. Bxf6 Nxf6 14. Rfd1 {really does seem like a better try for
an advantage, even if it should also not work.} Qe7 15. Nd2 (15. Ne5 Bxg2 16.

wrong with this, and on another it signs away most of White's winning chances.
As Mamedyarov commented in his press conference, ... Bxf3 is often a terrible
idea when White has both bishops, but after one pair has been traded off,
Black can worry less and can perhaps even think about winning the battle of
minor pieces.} (16. e3 {was a little more ambitious- it is still not
completely clear to me how Black intends to deploy his pieces. White's queen
can retreat to e2 and he can consider playing for e4, or even Bh3 and Nd2-c4.}

useful detail}) 19... Bxf3 20. Bxf3 c6 $11 {Black was very much fine in Ding,
L-Mamedyarov,S Shamkir Chess 2018}) 11... Nbd7 12. Nc3 Qe7 13. Bg5 $5 {An
interesting and very logical move, threatening e4-e5, which I hadn't
previously considered.} (13. Re1 Bxf3 14. Bxf3 Bxf4 15. Qxf4 c6 16. a5 e5 $1

rather less inspiring Hillarp Persson,T-Sjodahl,P Norrkoeping 2016}) 14... Bxf3
$6 (14... Qe8 $1 {Since I really don't like the text, there's only really one
other way to stop White from playing e4-e5. The hope here is that the
awkwardness of White's bishop being on h4 will counterbalance that of Black's
queen being on e8.}) (14... g5 $4 {simply doesn't work immediately:} 15. Nxg5
Bxg2 16. Kxg2 hxg5 17. Qxg5+ Kh7 18. Ne4 {and Black loses at least his
f6-knight.}) 15. Bxf3 g5 $6 ({The lesser evil, as in the examples above where
Black also took on f3, was} 15... c6 $5 16. Ne4 (16. e4 e5) 16... a5 {This is
a position I don't really know how to assess, except that Black isn't better.
Probably White, after messing around to some extent, will find there is no
better alternative than swapping both pairs of minor pieces and then playing
for b4 somewhere deep in an ending, and Black should hold.}) 16. Bxg5 hxg5 17.
Qxg5+ Kh8 18. Bxb7 Ra7 ({For me,} 18... Rab8 19. Bxa6 Rxb2 {is a lot more
natural, but Black is still worse.}) 19. Bg2 Nh7 20. Qd2 $14 {White's plan of
f4 and e4-e5 is extremely simple and hard to combat, though maybe White would
have been better served with the bishop on c6 than on g2.} f5 $6 ({Maybe
Black's best shot at counterplay was to try and establish a pawn presence in
the centre immediately with} 20... c5 {and if} 21. d5 {then perhaps} Rb8 {
or ...Ndf6 with the idea of ...e5.}) 21. e4 f4 22. e5 Bb4 23. Rfe1 f3 ({
I remember being a bit surprised Black didn't immediately go} 23... c5 {

the other rook:} 26... Rd7 27. Rd1 Rxd4 28. Rxd4 cxd4 29. Qxd4 Bc5 $14) 27.
