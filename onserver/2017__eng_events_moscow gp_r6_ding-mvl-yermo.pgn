a3 O-O 9. b4 Re8 {This quiet move is getting more popular these days.} ({
The reason might be that the old line} 9... Be6 10. d3 a5 {Very much a
double-edged move. Black wants to get a hold of the b3-square, but leaves his
b7-pawn vulnerable.} 11. b5 Nd4 {is currently getting challenged by} 12. Bb2 $1

success in Howell-Naroditsky, 2015, but things aren't that clear.}) 12... Nb3

Moscow GM Sergey Makarichev back in 1991!} ({Standard procedure is} 10. d3 Bf8

familiar with this position.} 11. Bb2 (11. Be3 Bg4 {Dubov-Vachier Lagrave, 2016

known was} 12. h3 Bh5 13. d3) 12... f5 {Maxime is not a kind of guy to back
down from challenge.} 13. Nc5 e4 14. Ne1 Be2 {[#] So the white rook is trapped,

to slip up a bit.} (26. Be4 $1 {was a great idea underlining the power of
centralization. White doesn't even mind to lsoe his remaining rook, as} Nc5 27.

Instead,} 30. Ke1 Rd7 31. Qc6 Kg8 32. Be2 Rfd8 33. Qxa6 $16 {was a better

World Championship cycle. The second miraculous save in rook endings (along
with the Grischuk game) make Vachier-Lagrave seem destined to qualify.} 1/2-1/2
