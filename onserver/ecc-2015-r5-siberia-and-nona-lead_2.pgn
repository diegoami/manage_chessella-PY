{Maybe the most important game of the tournament. The top seeds SOCAR were up
against Siberia and Kramnik faced Topalov. It was excitement at the maximum.}
1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 $5 {Kramnik sticks to his policy of play relatively
unknown, but not unsound, variations. The point with e3 is that there is a lot
of scope for deviations.} c5 4. Bd3 b6 5. O-O Bb7 6. c4 $5 {The move 6.c3 would
have taken the game into the Colle, 6.b3 into Colle-Zukertort. With the move
6.c4 we are into the e3 variation of the Queen's Indian.} cxd4 7. exd4 Be7
(7... d5 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. Ne5 {[%cal Gd1g4,Gg4h5] Will lead to similar positions
as in the game with a queen soon coming to g4 or h5.}) 8. Nc3 d5 ( 8... O-O $6
9. d5 $1 $14) 9. cxd5 Nxd5 {Black would have a great position if he could
castle and play Nc6, but it's White to move and he gets his attack started with
the next move.} 10. Ne5 $1 O-O 11. Qg4 (11. Qh5 {leads to a funny variation
after} Nf6 12. Qh4 Ne4 (12... Nc6 13. Bg5 g6 (13... Nxe5 14. Bxf6 Nxd3 15. Bxe7
Qd7 16. Bxf8 $16) 14. Ba6 $3 {is a well known trick which many famous players
have fallen into.}) 13. Qh3 Qxd4 14. Bf4 {More than 45 games have been played
with this move.} (14. Bxe4 Bxe4 15. Nf3 {It seems as if Black will lose some
material but it isn't the case after} Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Qd7 $1 17. Qxa8 Nc6 $17)
14... Nf6 15. Ne2 Qa4 16. Rfc1 $44 {This leads to a complex position where
White has enough compensation for the pawn.}) 11... f5 (11... Nf6 12. Qh4 {This
move transposes into the variation that we saw above.} (12. Qg3 {is an
additional option.})) 12. Qe2 Bf6 13. Bc4 Re8 14. Rd1 Nd7 {This has all been
seen before in the game Polgar-Bischoff. Now Kramnik improves White's play
with} 15. Bb5 $1 (15. Bxd5 {was played by Polgar and after} exd5 16. Bf4 Nf8
$11 {The position was round about equal.}) 15... Bxe5 16. dxe5 Qe7 17. Nxd5
Bxd5 18. Qh5 {Kramnik is probing the kingside, trying to induce dark squared
weaknesses with the move g6.} (18. Rxd5 exd5 19. e6 {doesn't really work on
many counts, the main one being the back rank weakness.} Qxe6 20. Qxe6+ Rxe6
$19 {[%cal Ge6e1]}) 18... g6 {One could say that this move was not necessary,
but the question then is what should have been played? The threat of Bg5 is not
so easy to meet.} (18... a6 19. Bg5 g6 20. Qh6 Qf7 21. Bxd7 Qxd7 {and we
transpose into a position similar to the game.}) 19. Qh6 Rec8 20. Bg5 Qf7 21.
Bxd7 $1 {Kramnik realizes that after the exchange of bishop for knight, it is
going to be just one way traffic. What is the reason for that? Because in
opposite coloured bishop middlegames the side with the initiative is the one
who has the better chances. Here White has the initiative because Black's
kingside is weak and in a practical game it is very difficult to defend such a
position.} Qxd7 22. Bf6 Qf7 23. b3 Qf8 24. Qf4 {Of course the queens should not
be exchanged at all costs.} Rc2 {What should be done next? It's time to
introduce a new warrior into the battle. A small one but one who will bring
about huge damage.} 25. h4 $1 {[%cal Gh4h5]} Rac8 26. h5 Qe8 27. Rd3 $1 {
White's attack develops like clockwork.} R2c3 28. Rad1 gxh5 {This allows a
strong combination, which is not very obvious. But nevertheless it is difficult
to suggest a good move for Black.} (28... Qf7 {Maybe Black should wait and
watch passively but even here White can slowly improve his position with moves
like Kh2 and then Qb4 or Qg3.}) 29. Rxd5 $1 exd5 30. e6 {Why exactly did White
sacrifice an exchange? First of all the rook on c3 is attacked. Secondly just
have a look at the black king. It is in desperate need of new clothes which he
will not get until the next game. And thirdly the exchange sacrifice was mainly
to open a few lines for the rook to come into the game. Now the combination of
queen+rook+bishop will be unstoppable.} (30. Rxd5 {was also very strong.})
30... R3c7 (30... Qxe6 31. Qg5+ Kf7 32. Qg7+ Ke8 33. Bxc3 $18) 31. Rxd5 Qxe6
32. Qg5+ Kf8 (32... Kf7 33. Rxf5 $18) 33. Rxf5 Rf7 (33... Rc1+ 34. Kh2 Qd6+ 35.
Be5+ $18) 34. Qh6+ {All these calculations are easy for a player of Kramnik's
class.} Ke8 35. Re5 Rc6 36. Qxh5 $1 {Topalov is going to lose a queen, after
which he will end up being a piece down. And so he resigned. What a smooth game
by Kramnik! How can we classify this battle? A positional game or an attacking
one? I would say this is a brilliant example of a positional attack. The move
Bxd7 was the key positional idea of giving up your bishop to end up in an
opposite bishop scenario where your attack will slowly but surely be
unstoppable.} (36. Rxe6+ $2 Rxe6 {of course Kramnik is not going to be so
careless and let Black come back into the game.}) 1-0
