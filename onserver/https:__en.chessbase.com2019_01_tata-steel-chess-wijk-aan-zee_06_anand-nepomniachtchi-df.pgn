nothing from the opening; that much is clear. What remains for him to do is to
play suitably circumspect moves so that he doesn't end up worse.} Qc7 20. Qe3
Qc6 21. Rhe1 Rfe8 22. a3 Kf8 {I suppose this move indicates a willingness to
repeat the position by artificial methods if necessary, and the arbiters were
disinclined to stand in the way of the draw anyway. That all being said, could
not Black have played on at the end?} (22... Rxd1+ 23. Rxd1 Ne6 {makes sense,
with either ...Qc5 or ...Nd4 in the pipeline, when it is hard to see what
White can constructively do. Though, of course, the position is still level.}
