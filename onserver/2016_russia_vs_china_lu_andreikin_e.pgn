sharp play.} 13. f4 Nc6 (13... Nexg4 $2 14. e5 $18) 14. Bh3 Nd7 15. g5 c4 16.
g6 ({White does not accept the offered pawn but prefers to attack himself.
After} 16. dxc4 Nc5 17. Be1 O-O-O {Black is a pawn down but has compensation.})
16... O-O-O {Offering another pawn.} 17. gxf7 Nc5 18. Be1 {[#]} c3 ({A safer
alternative was} 18... cxd3 19. cxd3 Qc7 {Now the engines recommend} 20. Na3
Qxf4+ 21. Kb1 Qxf7 22. Rf1 Qe8 {and give White a slight plus - though here it
is White who is a pawn down.}) 19. Nxc3 $5 {White gives a piece to keep his
structure intact. With three pawns for the piece he is definitely not worse.}
dxc3 20. Bxc3 Kb8 21. b3 a5 22. d4 {[#]} Nxd4 {Retreat seems to be no option
for Black. However, after} (22... Na6 23. Qc4 Nc7 24. Bb2 {White's pawn mass
looks intimidating.}) 23. Bxd4 Rxd4 24. Rxd4 Nxb3+ 25. cxb3 Qxd4 {[#]This was
Black's idea. The opposite-colored bishops make this position extremely sharp
and offer both sides chances. But objectively White should be better.} 26. Kb1

move before the time-control - and a very creative one, even though it does
not stop White's attack.} 41. Rxc5 Rxf1+ 42. Kb2 $1 ({After the tempting
counter-check} 42. Rc1+ Kb8 43. Rxf1 Qb5+ 44. Kc2 Qxf1 {Black regains the rook
and secures the draw. But after the strong text move Black has no adequate
defense against White's attack.}) 42... Qd1 43. Ra5+ Kb8 44. Qe5+ Kc8 45. Qxe6+
