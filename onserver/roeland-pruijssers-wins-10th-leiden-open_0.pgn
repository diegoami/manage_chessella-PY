{18-year-old Thomas Beerdsen is a talented player from the Netherlands. To beat
van Wely is a great result for the young boy.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nd7
4. O-O Ngf6 5. Re1 a6 6. Bd3 b5 7. c4 g5 $5 {Loek van Wely never shys away from
a fight. This line has been popular at the highest level, as it was tried first
by Topalov and then by Grischuk against none other than Magnus Carlsen.} 8.
Nxg5 Ne5 9. Be2 bxc4 10. Na3 {Beerdsen goes for Carlsen's approach in the first
game against Topalov. Although it is well known that 10.Nc3 is much better move
here.} (10. Nc3 Rb8 11. Rf1 $5 h6 12. Nf3 $14 {Carlsen-Grischuk London Chess
Classic 2015.}) 10... Rg8 11. f4 Nd3 12. Bxd3 cxd3 13. Qb3 d5 $1 { Loek is up
to the mark and the position is clearly in his favour at this point. } (13...

Nh5 $6 (15... hxg5 16. exf6 e6 17. Qh7 Rg6 18. fxg5 Rxg5 19. d3 Rg6 {Black
seems to be doing alright here. This seems like the most human variation to
play.}) 16. e6 $1 {An extremely strong retort by White, who now changes the
dimension of the play.} Bxe6 (16... hxg5 17. exf7+ Kxf7 18. Qh7+ Ng7 (18... Rg7
19. Qxh5+ $16) 19. fxg5 {And Black is just badly tangled.} Qd6 20. Rf1+ $18)
17. Nxe6 fxe6 18. Qf3 $1 Ng7 19. Qd3 (19. b3 $1) 19... Nh5 20. Qf3 Ng7 {Hoping
for a repetition but the position is just too good for White to repeat.} 21. b3
Kd7 22. Bb2 Nf5 23. Nc4 $1 {The knight enters with decisive effect on e5.} Bg7
(23... dxc4 24. Qb7+ Ke8 25. Qc6+ Kf7 (25... Qd7 26. Qxa8+ $18) 26. Qxe6+ $18)

$18) 26. Qh5+ Kf8 27. Qxf5+ $18) 24... Rxg7 25. Ne5+ Kd6 26. b4 {The material
is even and the black king is right in the centre. In short it is a completely
lost position.} c4 27. Qf2 (27. Kh1 {With the idea of g4 was quite strong.})
27... Qc7 28. g4 $2 (28. Kh1 $1 $18 {Avoiding the queen exchange was better.})
28... Qa7 $1 {With the exchange of queens Black's chances of survival
increases.} 29. Qxa7 Rxa7 30. Rac1 h5 31. d3 hxg4 32. dxc4 d4 33. b5 axb5
(33... Kc7 $1) 34. cxb5 Rxa2 $2 {The final mistake which seals the fate of the
game.} (34... g3 {and White is better. But anything is possible.}) 35. Rc6+ Kd5
36. Nd3 $1 {Nb4 mate is as well as Re5 are not so easy to parry.} Ne3 37. Nb4+
