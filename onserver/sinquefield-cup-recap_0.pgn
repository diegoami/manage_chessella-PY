Nxc3 9. Rxc3 b6 10. c6 Nf6 11. a3 a5 12. Bd3 Ne4 13. Rc2 f6 {The first
deviation of the game. 12...Ba6 has been played before by Caruana (against Giri
in Wijk aan Zee). Although the game was drawn, his position was a little
suspicious.} 14. Qe2 Bd6 15. O-O g5 $5 {Black didn't want to capture on f4, so
he forces White to capture himself!} (15... Bxf4 16. exf4 $6 {leaves the e6
pawn weak in the long run, and e5 will never be achieved.}) 16. Bxd6 Nxd6 17.
Re1 a4 18. Nd2 e5 $5 19. e4 $1 {Creating serious tension on the center...} f5
$1 {A funny looking move! The tension accumulates, but Black is ok no matter
which pawn Aronian takes.} 20. f3 (20. dxe5 fxe4 (20... Nxe4 $5) 21. exd6 exd3
22. Qxd3 Qxd6 $13) (20. exd5 $2 e4 $15) 20... dxe4 $6 {Releasing the tension at
the wrong moment.} (20... Re8 $1) 21. fxe4 Ra5 $2 {Caruana underestimates
White's attack and allows a brilliancy!} (21... exd4 22. e5 Re8 $14) 22. exf5
Nxf5 23. Bc4+ Kg7 24. d5 {Now e5 is very weak.} Re8 25. Ne4 {Perhaps Fabiano
underestimated this move? The knight is magnificently placed and Nd4 doesn't
work...} Nd4 26. Qh5 $1 {The point.} Nxc2 {otherwise he is just lost} 27. Nxg5
Bf5 28. Rf1 {Simple and sufficient. Black is up a rook, but Black simply cannot
defend his position:} Qf6 (28... Bg6 29. Rf7+ Kg8 (29... Bxf7 30. Qxh7+ Kf6 31.
Ne4+ Ke7 32. d6+ {and Black gets mated.}) 30. Qh6 $18) 29. Ne6+ (29. Rxf5 Qxf5
30. Ne6+ {seemed easier, but everything wins.}) 29... Rxe6 30. Rxf5 Qg6 31.
dxe6 {Being up two pawns usually forces resignation, but Black is lucky to
still be alive.} (31. Rg5 $1 {Was stronger according to the computer, and
flashier, but Aronian's move is winning also.}) 31... Qxh5 32. Rxh5 Nd4 33. e7
Ra8 34. Rxe5 {Two pawns is too much. Caruana flutters for a few more moves, but
it is over.} Re8 35. Re4 Nf5 36. Be6 Nd6 37. Bd7 Nxe4 38. Bxe8 Kf6 39. Bg6 1-0
