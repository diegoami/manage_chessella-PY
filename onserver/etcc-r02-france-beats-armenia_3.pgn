1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 {Bologan chooses the
English Attack against the Najdorf.} e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3 h5 {That's a logical
move to prevent White from expanding with g2-g4.} 9. Qd2 Nbd7 10. Nd5 Bxd5 11.
exd5 g6 {This is all main stream theory, with Bologan himself having played
three games against Molner, Esen and Dominguez in this line.} 12. Be2 Bg7 13.
O-O b6 {This is played with the intention to stop Na5.} ({Earlier everyone used
to} 13... O-O {but then} 14. Na5 $5 {would be pretty irritating.} ) 14. c4 O-O
15. Rac1 Nh7 16. Bd3 f5 17. Bb1 Rc8 18. Kh1 a5 19. a4 Nc5 20. Nxc5 bxc5 {White
surely has a very comfortable position with his two bishops. Sooner or later he
will have to break the kingside with g2-g4 to open up his bishops. Bologan
feels that this is the right moment to go for this critical move.} 21. g4 $5
{It is unclear whether this is premature or not. Maybe some preparation before
breaking out would have been better.} hxg4 22. fxg4 e4 $6 ( 22... f4 $1 23. Bf2
Qg5 24. Rg1 Qh6 {[%cal Gg6g5] Black should be ok.}) 23. gxf5 gxf5 24. Rg1 Kh8
25. Rxg7 $1 {Such sacrifices are as natural as a baby's smile for a player like
Bologan.} Kxg7 26. Qg2+ Kh8 27. Bd2 $1 {The bishop transfers itself to the
important long diagonal.} Qh4 28. Bc3+ (28. Rg1 $1 Qg4 29. Bc3+ Nf6 30. Qf1

Rh5+ $1 Kg8 33. Rxh4 $18) 32. Bxe5 dxe5 33. Qxe3 $18 {White is two pawns up and
the black king is completely exposed.} Ng4 34. Rxf8+ Kg7 35. Qe2 Kxf8 36. Bf5
Nxh2 {Radoslaw sacrifices his knight for the h2 pawn in the hope for a
perpetual check. But none exists.} (36... Nf2+ 37. Kg2 $18) 37. Qxh2 Qe1+ 38.
