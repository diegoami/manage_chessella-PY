{US team is second seed and one of the main candidates to win this event, with
three of its four players in the Top 10 in the world. However, that is not what
makes the US team a favorite in this event. It also has two strong young
players: Sam Shankland and Ray Robson who are close to 2700. Therefore, we can
say that the US is balanced and ready to win any match in this event. In this
match against the Scottish team, USA team's rating average was almost 300
points above their opponents in 'kilts'. However, in this game experienced
Scotch GM Colin McNab almost threw GM Shankland off the cliff.} 1. Nf3  c5  2.

up for a reversed Maroczy-bind.} (6... e5 $2 { bad due to} 7. Nxe5) 7. b3  (7.

opening.}) 7... e5  8. Bb2  f6  9. Rc1  (9. O-O Be7 10. Rc1 O-O 11. Ne1 {would
have transposed to the game Aronian-Svidler}) 9... Bg4 {(89s) A rare move. It
is funny to see that one of the players who played this move is actually the
oldest man in Canada! (see the ChessBase article on Zoltan Sarosy} 10. d3

dangerous attack for Black!}) 10... Qd7  11. Na4  b6  12. a3 {(62s) McNab
prepares for the typical b4 pawn sac. He also procrastinates a bit in order to
make sure that Shankland is not going to play h5-h4 against his kingside
castle.} O-O-O {(1460s) After almost 25 minutes of thinking, Shankland decides
to put his king in front of a rook on a semi-open file while the h1-a8 diagonal
is exposed and White's bishop is in it! Nevertheless, the move is not entirely
bad even if he probably would have been better off playing short castle and
asking White what he wants to do with his knight on a4!} 13. Qc2  Nd5 $6

McNab does not try to optimize his advantage. Maybe his approach of good enough
moves in the opening paid off due to the complications in the position, but in
a rook endgame you need to be one thing: a maximizer!} ( 36. f4 {seems more
appealing to me.}) 36... hxg4  37. Rxg4  Rd5 $1 {(7s) Shankland plays fast and
effective. He creates some counterplay.} 38. Rxg7 $2 {(30s) This throws away
his winning chances. McNab falls for Shankland's trap.} (38. Ka3 $1 g5 (38...
