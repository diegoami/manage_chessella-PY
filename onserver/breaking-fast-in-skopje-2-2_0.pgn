{The big matchup between Svetushkin and Georgiev was saved for the last round,
a dream scenario for the organizers and reporters alike. The Moldavian GM was
leading throughout the entire event and before the final game was up half a
point and having the white pieces too for the last round. Some would say that
the odds should have been on his side but playing in the morning against an
experienced and fearless opponent like Georgiev, while also having played two
very tough tournaments before the Karpos Open, could be a bit too much for
Svetushkin's plate...Here Georgiev has just played the typical:} 22... f5 {
