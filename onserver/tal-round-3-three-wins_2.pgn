afraid of} f4 {but I am not so sure. With the knight on d7 in such a structure,
I might play this,} (14... fxe4 15. Bxe4 Na5 {White gets the e4 square, but I
can play this.}) {but here White has} 15. c5 $1 dxc5 16. dxc5 Ne5 17. Be2 {with
the idea to play c4, and Bc3. Li Chao: I don't like the knight on e5. Anand:
Yes, it is hard to say.}) 14... Qh5  15. e4 Na5  ({Here, I was hesitating,
because I can play} 15... fxe4 16. Bxe4 (16. fxe4 { can win a tempo for White,

not at all worried about my position.}) 16. Rae1 {I suspected I was better

I had thought earlier.}) 17. fxe4  Ba6 {54 I was beginning to think that I may
be better, but he found the only move that does not make him worse.} 18. Bf4 $1

that he has Rf5. Li Chao suggested:} c5 20. Rf5 Qe8 21. Ref1 Qe6 {I thought
here he could take the file with} 22. Qf2 {It is close to being better, but
even if I take the pawn on c4, he has moves like Qa2. It is hard to keep the
structure perfect and do everything. I would be annoyed if there is a simpler
way to be better.}) 19. Bxc4  Nxc4  20. Qb3  d5  21. Qb5 {21 These moves are

to trap his bishop, but he goes} 28. g4 {and I couldn't see how to make

the king to b7 to free the rook, but it is other-worldly. It won't work here

for me to control what was happening.}) 22. Qc6 {So this is okay, but it is my
fault that I kept missing one tactic or the other...} Rfe8  (22... Qe8 {will
