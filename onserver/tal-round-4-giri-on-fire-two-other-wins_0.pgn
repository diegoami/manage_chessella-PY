This maneuver is rather hated by the computers, and personally I think it
simply wastes too much time.} (14... Nd7 $5) (14... a5 $5) 15. b4 Bf8 16. a4 g6
17. Bb2 b5 18. Ne4 Rb8 19. Bc1 Nd7 20. Bb3 Bxb3 21. Qxb3 {Upon close
inspection, it is clear that Black's position is simply bad. The knight on e4
is very powerful, White's structure is better, the rook on the a-file can
penetrate... also, White has nothing to worry about: there is little in the way
of counterplay.} Re6 22. axb5 axb5 23. Be3 Nf6 24. Rad1 Nxe4 25. dxe4 Qe8 26.
Rd5 {The symmetrical structure alleviates the position somewhat, but White
continues with the initiative.} Nd8 27. Ra1 Nb7 28. Ra7 c6 29. Rd1 Nd6 30. Nd2

Bxd2 (43... Be7 {was perhaps the best move, but it is rather passive.}) 44.
Bxd6 Bxc3 45. Re7 {Black has won a pawn, but now his pieces will be tied up
dangerous to the f7 pawn.} Qg8 $6 {natural but incorrect.} (45... Qf8 {White
doesn't have an immediate win here based on a discovery.} 46. Qe6 Ra8 {is
similar to the game, but up a tempo for Black.}) 46. Qe6 Qf8 (46... Ra8 47.
Bxe5+ Bxe5 48. Qxe5+ Kh7 49. Qf6 {cannot be held.}) 47. Kg2 {It's hard to come
up with a move here for Vishy.} (47. Rc7 Rxc7 48. Bxf8+ Kxf8 49. Qd6+ Re7 50.
Kg2 Bd4 51. f4 {is probably winning. Black is getting Zugzwanged, and will have
to play Ke8, dropping both c6 and b5 soon.}) (47. Bxe5+ $2 Bxe5 48. Qxe5+ Kg8
{is not clear at all.}) 47... Rd8 (47... Ra8 48. Qd7 {and the simple h4-h5 is
hard to deal with.} Bd4 49. h4 (49. Qxc6 Ra2 $11) 49... h5 50. Qxc6 Ra2 51. Re8
$18) 48. Bc5 Bd4 49. Qxc6 Kg8 (49... Bxc5 50. Qxc5 {is not a lot of fun
either.}) 50. Qxb5 Rb8 51. Rxf7 $1 (51. Rxf7 Rxb5 52. Rxf8+ Kg7 53. Rc8 Bc3 54.
