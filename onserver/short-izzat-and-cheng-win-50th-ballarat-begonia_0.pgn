1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {Nigel is a staunch adherent of the advance variation
in the Caro Kann and the currently popular 4.Nf3 followed by Be2 system is
named after him.} c5 $5 {Izzat goes for this interesting variation trying to
get his opponent out of theory.} 4. c3 {Nigel chooses the most solid system.
Of course taking the pawn on c5 is more critical.} Nc6 5. Ne2 Bg4 6. Be3 {
Short has already played it twice against Granda Zuniga and Alexey Dreev in
the past.} e6 7. a3 Nge7 8. f3 Bf5 9. b4 cxd4 10. cxd4 Nc8 $1 {A very nice
manoeuvre trying to get to the c4 weakness.} 11. g4 Bg6 12. Bg2 $6 {This move
looks a tad dubious. It allows the knight to sit comfortably on c4 and the
bishop doesn't look so well placed on g2.} (12. Nf4 {It would have been better
to eliminate this bishop.}) 12... Nb6 13. O-O Nc4 14. Bf2 $5 {It is obvious
that Nigel saw Bxb1. But I think Bc1 was too depressing a move for him to make.
} Bxb1 15. Qxb1 (15. Rxb1 Nxa3 16. Rb3 Nc4 17. b5 N6a5 18. Rb1 {was another
way to play but after} Be7 {Black looks pretty good with the extra pawn.})
15... Nd2 {Black wins the exchange.} 16. Qd3 Nxf1 17. Rxf1 {For the deficit in
exchange, White has a clear plan of playing on the kingside with f4-f5. Of
course the compensation would not be enough but White has enough play to
create complications.} Be7 18. f4 Bh4 (18... O-O 19. Be3 {With the idea of f5
looks scary but Black can strike back with} f6 $5 20. exf6 Bxf6 21. b5 Na5 22.
f5 $5 {Weakening the d5 square.} exf5 23. Nf4 $1 $44 {This is exactly what
Nigel must have been looking for.}) 19. Be3 $1 {Keeping the bishops on the
board to muddy the waters in future.} Qe7 20. Bd2 {Threatening b5 followed by
Bb4.} a6 21. Kh1 {White tries to get his knight to f3 via g1 in order to break
f5.} (21. f5 $5) 21... Na7 22. Ng1 Qd8 $2 {The crucial mistake of the game.} (
22... h6 {Stopping g5 was important.}) 23. g5 $1 $16 {With the knight coming
to f3, the bishop on h4 is trapped.} h6 24. Qh3 (24. f5 $5 Bxg5 25. fxe6 fxe6
26. Qg6+ Kd7 27. Bxg5 hxg5 28. Rf7+ Kc8 29. Qxe6+ $18) 24... hxg5 25. fxg5 Qc7
26. Nf3 Qc2 27. Be1 Rc8 28. Nxh4 {From being materially down, White now has
two pieces for a rook.} Nb5 $2 (28... g6 {White is better but Black can fight
on.}) 29. g6 $1 Nxd4 30. gxf7+ Kd7 31. Qg4 g5 32. Qxd4 gxh4 33. Bxd5 {A topsy
turvy game which was won by Nigel thanks to his superior practical skills.} 1-0
