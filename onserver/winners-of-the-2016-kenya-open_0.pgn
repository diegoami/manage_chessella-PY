{Here is my first round game from the recent Kenya Open. Normally, the first
game is easy for the higher rated player, but my youthful opponent gave me a
really tough time. I had to sneak to avoid a threefold repetition and draw.
Part of me felt guilty for not agreeing a draw, part of me felt that I play
chess to win.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bf5 5. Nc3 e6 6. Be2 Bd6 7.

14. Qc2 Ndf6 15. Ne2 Bb8 {Lining up my Q and B on the diagonal does not mean
much, but I couldn't find an active plan} 16. c5 {Inviting ...e5, but my pieces
have moved away from control of that square.} Bh7 17. b4 Qc7 18. Nf4 Nd7 {This
move allows a tactic on f7 on move 21.} 19. Ne5 {I liked his move as now I have
no easy access to the h2 square.} Ng5 20. Bxh7+ Nxh7 21. Nxf7 Kxf7 22. Qxh7 Nf8

dxe5 d4 {At the time, I thought this was a forced pawn sacrifice as my queen
only has an exit on e4, but after 29...Qd4 30. Qxe4 dxe4 31 Rc4 I am down a
pawn. So I plunged into the complications.} 30. Bxd4 Rxd4 $1 {The exclaimation
mark is only for the practical nature of the exchange sacrifice.} 31. exd4 Rd8
$6 {31...Nf4+ should lead to a perpetual check.} 32. Ke3 Nh4 33. Qh7+ Ke8 34.
Qg8+ Ke7 35. Qg7+ Ke8 36. Qg8+ Ke7 37. Qg7+ Ke8 38. Qg8+ {My opponent did not
know the rules. If he had called the arbiter when he was making his move, the
game would have been drawn. Instead, he made his move, pressed the clock and
after some time told me that he thought the position a draw (which I was ready
to accept). However, my desire to win took over and I quickly varied. In the
meantime he then called the arbiter, but it was too late. I thought my next
move could lose, but I wanted to play on...} Kd7 $6 { (the only reason this
move gets ?! is because it keeps the game going. It really should lose as the
pawn on e6 supports the f5 square for the Nh4. With it gone, my attack should
fall apart.} 39. Qf7+ Kc8 40. Qxe6+ Kb8 41. Qg4 $4 { Here 41.Qf7! wins outright
because my queen doesn't even have access to d5.} Qd5 {I am an exchange and two
pawns down, but his king is in the middle of the board. And my opponent was now
down to a couple of minutes....} 42. Rhg1 $4 { My opponent blunders in time
pressure.} Rf8 {The tables have turned and now Black is winning.} 43. Rg3 Rf4
44. Qd1 Re4+ {My opponent resigned as the queen falls.} ({Even better is;}
