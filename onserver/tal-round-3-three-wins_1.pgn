1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 c6 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bxf6 {The Moscow is
definitely quieter than the Anti-Moscow with 6.Bh4, but that doesn't mean it
doesn't hold any dangers for Black.} Qxf6 7. g3 Nd7 8. Bg2 dxc4 9. O-O Be7 10.
Ne4 Qf5 11. Ned2 e5 12. e4 Qh5 {A novelty that I do not think will be repeated
any time soon, even if objectively the move is ok, it gives White unnecessary
options.} (12... Qe6 {Had been played by Topalov earlier this year against Li
Chao, but also by Anand a few years ago.}) 13. Nxc4 exd4 14. Qxd4 Qc5 $5 (14...

17. Ne3 Qb4 18. Nd4 $1 {Clearly Mamedyarov is gearing for a Kingside attack,
not caring about his pawn on b2. The position is objectively dangerous for
Black, he must be very careful, though the computer's cold blood says that
black is fine with accurate play.} Rd8 $6 (18... Bc5 $1 19. Rfd1 (19. Rad1 Qxb2
20. e6 Bxd4 21. exf7+ Rxf7 22. Rxd4 Bd7 $15) 19... Qxb2 20. a4 {trying to
perpetual the queen.}) 19. Rad1 Qxb2 20. e6 {Black cannot get rid of the knight
on d4 now, and he must find precise moves.} Bxe6 (20... Bf6 21. Nef5 $1 {With
an initiative, was the best hope for black.}) 21. Nxe6 fxe6 22. Bh3 $1 { Simply
put, Black's lightsquares are too weak. The rest is easy for an attacking
prowess like Mamedyarov.} Kh8 23. Bxe6 g5 24. Ng4 Rxd1 25. Rxd1 Qg7 26. Ne5 $18
