Qxb2 9. O-O $5 {[Might have been played for the surprise value, more than
anything]} (9. Bd4 Qb4+ 10. Nbd2 Qxc4 11. Nxc4 Bb4+ 12. Nfd2 {leaves white
with more than enough compensation for the pawn}) 9... Nd5 (9... Qxa1 $4 10.
Bd4 {traps the queen}) 10. Bd4 Qxe2 {[Excellent fight in an open tournament,
though it does look if it all hangs by a thread for black]} 11. Qb3 Nb4 12. Na3
$2 {[Inexplicable - after bottling up black's queen, it is logically expected
that white would want to swallow him instead of letting him escape]} ({White
should have gone for the eccentric looking} 12. Ne1 $1 {[Threatening Bg2-f3
trapping the black queen]} Qh5 (12... Bxd3 13. Nc3 (13. Bf3 $4 Qxf1#) 13... Qg4
14. Nxd3 Qxd4 15. Nf4 Qb6 16. Rae1 {and looking at black's state of
development, white is completely better in spite of the three(!) pawn deficit})
13. a3) 12... Qxd3 {[It is still a glorious mess with white having the
initiative but black has better resources now]} 13. Qb2 $2 {[This looks
obvious, but overlooks a crucial tactical detail, which white probably
overlooked]} (13. Bc3 $142) 13... Qa6 {[#] [Diagram]} 14. Bxg7 $4 {[Looks
straightforward, but look for a Geometry here for black!]} Nd3 {[This
intermezzo seals the day for black]} 15. Qc3 Bxa3 16. Bxh8 Bb2 $1 {[The point!
The black bishop does a reverse turn with Bf8xa3-b2xh8 to save the day for
black! Not every day that you see such an artistic straight lines on the board]
