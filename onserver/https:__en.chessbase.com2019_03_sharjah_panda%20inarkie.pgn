has a very specific idea. White wants to push away the knight on d5 with e4,
avoiding the capture of the knight on c3. Also the knight on a4 keeps an eye
on the c5 square.} e5 (5... Bg7 {is the main move, but Inarkiev goes for
something active.}) 6. dxe5 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Ne3 $5 {This move has already been
played in 53 games with Aronian also haveing tried it with black.} 8. fxe3
Bxd2+ 9. Qxd2 Qh4+ 10. g3 Qxa4 {Computers are very happy with White's position
and give an advantage of nearly a pawn. But this is not true. Practically
White's position is not so easy to play with these tripled pawns.} 11. Qd4 (11.
Bg2 O-O 12. Nf3 Nc6 13. O-O $14 {Definitely leads to a position which is
slightly better for White.}) 11... Qa5+ 12. b4 Qa4 13. e6 f6 (13... O-O $5) 14.
Bg2 (14. Qxf6 Qxb4+ $19) 14... Nc6 15. Bxc6+ Qxc6 16. Nf3 Qxe6 {Black has been
able to restore the material balance and slowly took over.} 17. O-O O-O 18.
