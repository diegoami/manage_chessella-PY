{The question is: Bxf6 or no Bxf6?!} 19. Kh1 {I decided to play a prophylactic
move.} ({To me} 19. Bxf6 {was unclear in whose favour that is.} gxf6 20. Bd1

to.} ({It was blurry to me whom should have the advantage in the final
position.} 20. Bxf6 gxf6 21. Bd1 Bd7 22. Ba4 Bxa4 23. Nxa4 c4 24. Qd2 Kh8 $13 {
The engine likes White but I have a suspicion that is because of the d and e
pawns, which is not enough reasoning. Black has easy play with the same Kh8,
Rg8 idea and b5 is also in the air.}) 20... a6 {For the 3rd time: the same
question:) And probably the best moment to have done it.} 21. Bh4 {This move
looks like from a different movie.} ({Such an interesting structure appears
after the well known by now} 21. Bxf6 {But how exactly to evaluate it? That is
a different story...} gxf6 22. Bd1 Bd7 23. Bh5 b5 24. Nd1 Kh8 $132) 21... Qd6
22. a4 Rac8 23. h3 {Ruined the structure and the game just one move later as I
didn't see a simple tactic.} ({Now it is a bit late for} 23. Bxf6 {but
certainly better than what happened on the board.} gxf6 $15) 23... Bd7 24. g4
Nxg4 25. hxg4 Qh6 26. Qh3 g5 {the rest is less important as White didn't get a
chance to return into the game.} 0-1

{Second example of structural change. Is} 11... d5 {working?} 12. e5 {It
doesn't but not exactly with this move.} ({Much stronger was} 12. Nde2 $1 {
this retreat I completely missed during the game. The knight on b6 is surely
very sad.} e6 13. f4 Qc7 14. e5 $16 {Positionally and structurally, Black is
on the ropes.}) 12... Ne4 13. Nxe4 dxe4 {How should White continue?} 14. Bxe4 {

stopping any potential counterplay on the queenside.} Qb6 40. Qe1 Qc7 {What to
do, Black is suffering and has no other way but wait.} 41. Qd2 {With not so
much time on the clock, moving the pieces here and there is a very common
