remain on the board and the funny thing is that there is not even one bit of an
imbalance. Both sides have same kind of minor pieces and the pawn structure is
identical. Yet you can see how this position goes down for the Armenian number
one.} 32. Bd3 {White allows the move c4 with a gain of tempo. More than the
tempo it's the space that matters in this sort of positions.} ( 32. Be2 {with
the idea of exchanging the bishops also doesn't work because of} c4 33. Bf3

the bishop pair but in return his pawn on d3 is weak and requires constant

it doesn't really change the assessment of the position, although one must

play as black.} 56. hxg4 fxg4 57. fxg4 Bg5 58. Ke1 Bb3 59. Kd2 Bc4 60. Ke1 Bd5

error of the game.} (61. Nxd5 Kxd5 {looks scary because the Black king is
penetrating and also the d3 pawn is now no longer vulnerable, but it's a draw.}

is just no way through on the queenside. So Black has to shift his attention on
the kingside. But that too doesn't work as when the black king goes to the
kingside he will have to pass through f4 when the white king will move upto
d2.} Kd5 68. Bd4 $1 {It's important to relocate the bishop to f2.} Ke4 69. Bf2
