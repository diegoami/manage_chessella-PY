1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5 4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 {I have never had much luck
accepting that cursed pawn,} ({usually settling on} 5. b6) 5... Bxa6 6. Nc3 d6
7. e4 Bxf1 8. Kxf1 g6 9. Nf3 Bg7 10. g3 O-O 11. Kg2 Qb6 $5 ({Against the
standard} 11... Nbd7 {I wanted to try the modern line} 12. a4) {Now I had a
change of heart.} 12. Re1 (12. a4 Na6 13. Qe2 Nb4 14. Nb5 {was still possible.}
) 12... Nbd7 13. h3 Rfb8 14. Re2 {All this reflecting took a good 30 minutes
of my clock and in the end I found myself trudging old dusty roads of a
standard Benko setup.} (14. e5 {was another option.}) 14... Qa6 15. Bg5 {
[#] Obviously I wanted to provoke h7-h6. After the game James told me he was
not in the mood for that.} Rb4 ({Yet,} 15... h6 16. Be3 Nb6 17. Rc1 Nc4 18. b3
Nxe3+ 19. Rxe3 {At least Black doesn't have Bh6 here.}) 16. a3 (16. Rc1 h6 17.
a3 {would have been a more refined move order.}) 16... Rb7 17. Rc1 Nb6 18. Rcc2
{[#]} Nc4 $1 ({On} 18... Na4 19. Nxa4 Qxa4 {I prepared a great shot} 20. b4 $1
{main line being} cxb4 21. Rc8+ Bf8 22. Qxa4 Rxa4 23. Bh6 Nd7 24. Rec2 $1 bxa3
25. Rxf8+ Nxf8 26. Rc8 {mating.}) 19. e5 {To be honest, I mainly choose thios
move not to get worse should things go wrong somewhere.} (19. Qd3 h6 20. Bxf6
Bxf6 21. Nd1 Nb6 22. Qxa6 Rxa6 23. Ne3 {seemed a reasonable way to proceed as
well.}) 19... Nd7 20. exd6 ({Once again, the real try was the double-edged} 20.
e6 $5 {recommended by Jaan Ehlvest.}) 20... exd6 21. Bc1 Nde5 22. Nxe5 Nxe5 23.
Bf4 {[#]} h6 {Unfortunate, but it was hard to foresee White's 26th move.} ({
In case of} 23... f5 {I could have settled for} 24. Bxe5 Bxe5 25. f4 Bd4 26.
Qe1 $14) ({The most forcing line was} 23... Nd3 24. Bxd6 Nxb2 ({Nothing comes
out of} 24... Rd7 25. Be7 Bxc3 26. Rxc3 Rxd5 27. Kh2 $16) 25. Rxb2 Rxb2 26.

win out of this.}) 24. Ne4 Nd3 25. Bxd6 Nxb2 {[#] Here it comes!} 26. Qh1 $3 {
I cannot recall ever playing a stranger move than this. Shockingly, it works.}
c4 (26... Nd3 27. Nxc5 Qxd6 28. Nxb7 Qxd5+ 29. Kh2 {is the idea.}) 27. Kh2 Nd3
28. Nc5 Nxc5 29. Bxc5 {Just like that White emerged with a healthy extra pawn.
For the rest of the game James Plaskett had to deal with a tough defensive
task aggravated by time shortage.} Rc8 30. Bb4 c3 ({I thought} 30... Bf8 {
was better.}) 31. Qe4 Kh7 32. d6 Rd7 33. Qd5 Bf6 $2 {[#]} (33... Rcd8 $1) 34.
