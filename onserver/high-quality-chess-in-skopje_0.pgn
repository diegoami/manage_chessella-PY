{It is surprising that a solid player like Anish, who hardly ever loses, goes
down to Babula who is rated nearly 250 points below him. But in chess even the
best blunder, and when that happens nothing can be done!} 1. d4 e6 2. c4 d5 3.
Nc3 Bb4 4. Nf3 dxc4 5. e3 b5 6. a4 c6 {By some weird move order we are now into
one of the sharpest lines of chess called the Noteboom Variation.} 7. Bd2 a5 8.
axb5 Bxc3 9. Bxc3 cxb5 10. b3 Bb7 11. bxc4 b4 12. Bb2 {[%csl Ga5,Gb4,Yc4,
Yd4,Ye3] [#]This is all pretty well known theory. Black has those two extremely
dangerous looking passed pawns on the queenside and White has the central
pawns. I would say it is one of the most exciting and imbalanced opening
positions in the game of chess.} Nf6 13. Bd3 O-O 14. O-O Nbd7 15. Nd2 Qc7
(15... e5 16. f4 (16. Bc2 Qc7 17. Ba4) 16... exd4 17. exd4 Re8 18. d5 Nc5 19.
Bc2 $14 {leads to different kind of position.}) 16. f4 {Preventing Black from
hitting the centre with e5. But this has left the g2 point quite soft and Black
can advance his queenside majority which otherwise would not have been
possible.} a4 $1 17. Rb1 (17. Rxa4 $2 Qc6 $19) 17... Qd6 18. Qe2 Rfd8 19. e4
Nc5 $1 {Anish is on the right track until now and navigating his way around
with quite some precision.} 20. e5 Qc6 21. dxc5 Rxd3 (21... Ng4 22. Be4 Qxc5+
23. Kh1 Rxd2 24. Qxd2 Bxe4 25. Bd4 Qxc4 26. Qxb4 $16 {is another complicated
variation which ends in a better position for White.}) 22. exf6 Rad8 23. Nf3
Qxc5+ 24. Kh1 {Black is a piece down but has excellent compensation. White's
centre is completely demolished and the a and b passers are still on the board.
} b3 $2 {A bad move by Anish. It blocks his queenside pawns, and the extra
piece makes itself felt.} (24... a3 25. Be5 b3 26. fxg7 Qe3 $11 {was the right
way to continue when Black is not even worse.}) 25. Rbd1 $1 {I wonder what
Anish missed here.} R3d6 26. Be5 Rxd1 27. Rxd1 Qa5 28. Nd4 {White's forces
co-ordinate perfectly.} g6 29. h3 Qb6 30. Kh2 h6 31. c5 Qa6 (31... Qxc5 32.

sad part of the story is that the black king cannot participate in this battle.
} Kh7 39. g4 {The white king will slowly come over and clean up the pawns.} 1-0
