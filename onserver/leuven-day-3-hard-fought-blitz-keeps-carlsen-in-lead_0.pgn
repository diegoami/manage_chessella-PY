Be3 Nd4 22. f5 Rf8 $6 {MVL is a renowned Najdorf player, so his instincts in
these wild Sicilians are second to none as a rule. This however is a strange
choice and one can only speculate whether he feared Nxf7 or possibly e5 and
freed up a square for his knight.} 23. Qh3 Rfd8 {Black is waffling and it is
cler that at this moment, under the pressure of blitz, the French man is unsure
how to continue. One thing is clear: shuffling the rook around isn't it. } 24.
