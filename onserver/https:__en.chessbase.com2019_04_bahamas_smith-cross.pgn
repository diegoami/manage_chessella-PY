I groaned inwardly when he played this variation. Since it has so seldom come
up in my games, I have never really studied it. Naturally I had seen it played
in the recent Carlsen-Caruana match.} Nxd5 8. Qxd5 $2 {Nathan shows his lack
of opening knowledge, but with his youthful talent, he proceeds to outplay me
from here on out.} a6 9. Na3 Be6 10. Qd1 Be7 $2 {I thought simple development
was called for, but apparently black needs to take action right away.} (10...

nearly four hundred points lower-rated, I was well aware that young talents
often play far better than their ratings.} b4 $6 (15... Bxd5 16. cxd5 Nb8 17.

really didn't want to play Rh6 and go for the repetition, so I decided to risk
losing.} (25... Rh6 26. Qg5 Rg6 $11) 26. exd5 $2 (26. Ng4 $1 Qc7 27. Nxe5 $16)

couldn't see deeply enough to catch all the nuances and I feared it could lose,
while I thought my move would at least not lose.} (34... Nc3 $3 35. Na5 (35.

blunders. He saw his threat but failed to notice his back-rank weakness. I
felt bad for young Nathan but certainly relieved since a loss or draw here
would have been a serious blow to my chances of winning the tournament.} (35.
