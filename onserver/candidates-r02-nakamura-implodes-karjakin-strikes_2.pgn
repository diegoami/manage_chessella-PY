1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.
Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. b3 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Be7 7. Bg2 d5 ({ Of course} 7... c6
{is the main line, but 7...d5 is also becoming quite popular these days.})
8. cxd5 exd5 9. O-O O-O 10. Nc3 Nbd7 11. Qc2 {Sergey makes the normal
developing moves and looks forward to a complex middlegame.} Re8 12. Rfd1
Nf8 (12... Rc8 {with the idea of directly going c5 would be more appropriate.})
13. Ne5 Bb7 14. Bc1 $5 {The bishop would be much better placed on b2.}
Ne6 15. Bb2 Bd6 {The threat is Nxd4.} 16. e3 (16. Nb5 $5 Nxd4 17. Bxd4
Bxe5 18. Bxe5 Rxe5 19. Qxc7 $14) 16... a6 17. Ne2 c5 $6 {Black is absolutely
not ready for this opening of the center. Firstly have a look at the white
pieces. They are just perfectly situated: the bishops on long diagonals,
one knight in the center, the other ready to jump to f4 to put further
pressure.} ( 17... c6 {Trying to hold was the right way to proceed.})
18. dxc5 Nxc5 (18... bxc5 19. Nc4 $1 Bc7 20. Nf4 $16) 19. Nd3 Nce4 20.
Rac1 {Kramnik, who is so good at such technical positions, felt that Black
must do something quickly or else he would just have to suffer with a
passive and inferior position.} Rc8 21. Qb1 Qe7 22. Bd4 Rxc1 23. Rxc1
b5 24. b4 {The sad face of the bishop on b7 determines White's advantage}
Nd7 25. a3 Nf8 26. Ba1 Ne6 27. Qa2 Bc7 28. Nd4 Bb6 29. h4 $5 {[#] Karjakin
has things under control and he tries to gain some space on the kingside.
It is true that this weakens the g3 square, but is it concretely dangerous?
Nakamura thinks so and that explains his next move.} Nxg3 $4 {A huge blunder
at this level. But as it is rightly said, such blunders do not happen
in vaccuum. It was the sustained pressure of Karjakin that prompted Hikaru
to make the mistake.} (29... Nxd4 30. Bxd4 Bxd4 31. exd4 Qf6 $14 { is
slightly worse but nonetheless playable.}) 30. fxg3 Nxd4 31. Bxd4 Bxd4
32. exd4 Qe3+ {Hikaru must have ended his calculations at this point.
The knight on d3 is hanging and if Nf2 then the c1-rook hangs. So White
has to give back the piece. But Sergey has seen a move further.} 33. Qf2
$1 Qxd3 34. Rc7 $1 { [%cal Gc7f7,Gc7b7] A strong double attack and just
like that Black loses a piece.} f5 35. Rxb7 h6 36. Bxd5+ Kh7 37. Bg2 Re2
38. Bf1 {A painful defeat for Hikaru, but still a long way to go.} 1-0
