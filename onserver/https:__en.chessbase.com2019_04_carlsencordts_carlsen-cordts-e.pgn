{We see the earliest (!) game of Magnus Carlsen in the ChessBase Megadatabase.
When the game was played the future World Champion was nine years old -
Carlsen was born November 30, 1990. In 2004 Carlsen became grandmaster, in
2010 he became the world's number one, and in 2013 he became World Champion.
Back then there was no increment and the time limit was 120 minutes for 40
moves, 60 minutes for another 20 moves, and another 30 moves for the rest of
the game.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. Nf3 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 {The only move to
