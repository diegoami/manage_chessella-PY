1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Be3 e6 5. Nd2 Bb4 $6 {A relatively rare line.
Black brings the bishop to the queenside and - theoretically at least - has
more room for maneuver on the kingside. However, the black-squared bishop
might be missed as a defender.} 6. c3 Ba5 7. Be2 Nd7 8. f4 Nh6 $146 {A new
move but in the further course of the game the knight never fully recovers
from starting the game on the rim.} 9. h4 f6 10. g4 Bg6 11. h5 Bf7 12. Bd3 fxe5
13. fxe5 {Black's unusual treatment of the opening does not really convince.
His pieces appear to be scattered and lack harmony. However, if Black manages
to coordinate his pieces he might be able to exploit the weaknesses in White's
position.} c5 14. a3 Rc8 15. Nh3 cxd4 16. cxd4 Qc7 17. O-O O-O 18. Nb3 Bb6 19.
Rc1 Qb8 20. Rxc8 Qxc8 21. Qe2 {[#] White is better: he has a space advantage
and Black's pieces lack coordination. White now tries to convert his
positional advantages into something more tangible by building up an attack on
the black king.} Qd8 22. Bg5 Qe8 23. Bb1 {A human move.} ({The engines prefer
the straightforward} 23. Bxh6 $1 gxh6 24. Qe3 Kg7 25. Bb5 {White is ready to
give up his bishops to win a pawn. One possible line is} Rg8 26. Qf4 a6 27.
Bxd7 Qxd7 28. Qf6+ Kf8 29. Qxh6+ {with a winning advantage for White.}) 23...
Kh8 24. Nf4 Bg8 25. Kg2 Nf7 $6 ({Trying to reduce White's pressure by
exchanging pieces with} 25... Bd8 $1 {looks more natural than the contorted
knight-move.}) 26. Bh4 Nh6 {The knight returns to h6...} 27. Kh3 Bd8 28. Qe1
Nf7 {...but again grows restless and returns once more to f7.} 29. Bxd8 Nxd8
30. Qh4 {Threatening the devastating Ng6+...} Nf7 {...which brings black's
knight back to f7 to keep an eye on h6.} 31. g5 Qe7 32. Rg1 $2 {[#]Missing the
chance to finish the game with a tactical shot:} (32. Ng6+ $1 hxg6 {and now}
33. Rxf7 $1 {and White wins.}) 32... Nfxe5 {The unlucky knight sacrifices
itself to give Black counterplay - which almost succeeded.} 33. dxe5 Nxe5 {[#]}
34. Ng6+ $2 {Missing another tactical shot and spoiling the win.} ({White wins
with} 34. Bxh7 $1 {Black cannot take the bishop. After} Bxh7 (34... Kxh7 35.
g6+) 35. Ng6+ {Black is mated or loses the queen.}) 34... Nxg6 35. hxg6 Rf3+
36. Kg4 Qf8 37. Qh2 {[#]} Rxb3 $2 {Another tactical mistake.} (37... e5 $1 {
exploits the precarious position of White's king and is winning. Black
threatens 38...Be6+ and suddenly it is White who is helpless against the
mating threats.}) 38. gxh7 Bf7 $2 {Probably both players were in time-trouble
but it is Black who commits the last tactical mistake.} ({After} 38... Qf3+ $1
39. Kh4 Bxh7 40. g6 Qe3 {threatening ...Qh6+, both sides have nothing better
than a repetition of moves, e.g.} 41. Kg4 Qf3+ 42. Kh4 Qe3) 39. Rf1 $1 {
Now White is winning again.} g6 40. Qe5+ 1-0
