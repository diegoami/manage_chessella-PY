{This game was without a doubt the most critical one for the final standings.
After an intense fight, with many structural changes and maneuvers, White got
more space, the bishop pair and dangerous attacking perspectives.} 1. e4 c6 2.

chances to hang on to the game since the king on g7 is not so ill anymore,
while the g4 pawn is also a target.} Qg5 27. Rf4 Qh6 28. Rf3 gxf5 {In Romanian
chess schools we learned that eliminating the tension is not always a good
idea, unless the lines have been calculated thoroughly. Black is already in
trouble but opening the king speeds up the process. It is however a very human
move, especially with little time on the clock, when at least for the brain,
those forcing moves bring some clarity.} (28... Qg5 {Maybe the result would
have been the same 1-0, but very often the more resilience, the more
opportunities.}) 29. gxf5 Rag8 30. Nf4 {Bringing an extra piece in the attack
is the most natural reaction but it doesn't quite work in this particular
moment. White missed Black's regrouping idea which will be revealed further on.

honest and perhaps too harsh, when commenting about the game:"I played bad,

words sound like a fighting game, which by definition is prone to errors,
especially if playing in the morning and with two rounds each day.} 1-0

I absolutely loved the way I played so far. I was sharp, calculating and
seeing many lines, the opening phase went great, in other words: Black
outplayed White and now it's purely about collecting the dividents.} 26. Kc4 $1
{The exclamation mark stands for the surprise it gave me during the game. My
eyes popped and I started doubting myself. Simply because I didn't consider
this move doesn't mean it is a brilliant one, so I should just sit back, relax
and look at the board again. Instead, I panicked.} Nxa6 {Nothing wrong yet but
I can say that mentally I was disturbed: how can I ruin such a beautifully
constructed game by not seeing one move? Needless to say how poisonous those
thoughts are.} ({Black is so winning that it doesn't really matter which move
will be played.} 26... d3 {rolling the pawns}) ({Or} 26... c6 {Zugzwang?!:)}

is essential for stopping White's defensive ideas and for attacking plans as
well.} 27... Ra8 $19) 28. Kxd4 b3 {More panick as now the clock is ticking too.
In my defense though, here I started calculating again and it looked to me
like the best move. And it is:)} 29. a4 {After being so winning before, now
Black must keep an eye on that a-pawn.} Nb4 (29... Bb4 $142 30. Kd3 Bd2 $19 {

this typical occurence: a surprising move which one missed shouldn't
destabilize the mind nor the position.} 0-1
