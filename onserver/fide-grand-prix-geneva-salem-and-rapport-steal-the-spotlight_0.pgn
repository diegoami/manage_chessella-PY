{This was a game that I was betting would be interesting. Both players are
sharp and creative.} 1. e4  c5  2. Nf3  a6 {8 Probably a small surprise, but it
didn't take Salem long to answer.} 3. c4  Nc6  4. d4  cxd4  5. Nxd4  e5  6. Nf5
{240 The quickest route to d5. In a normal Sveshnikov the knight would to via
b5-a3-c2-e3-d5. This way White wins two tempi. However, since White is already
commited with c4, Black's position is playable.} d6  7. Nc3  g6  8. Ne3  Bh6
{23 An exotic move, but logical. In this kind of position Black typically plays
Be7-g5 trying to exchange this bishop for a strong White piece.} (8... Bg7 {is
the most played move and White can answer with different setups. In a recent
game he went for:} 9. Bd3 Nf6 10. Ned5 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 {Reaching a Kalashnikov
type of position. This may be slightly improved for White, but I don't think
there is a big difference.} O-O 12. Be3 Be6 13. Qd2 Rc8 14. O-O Ne7 $6 (14...
f5 15. f3 Bxd5 16. cxd5 Nd4 {would be the normal answer and it's better than
the game's continuation.}) 15. Rac1 Bxd5 16. cxd5 $16 { 1-0 (57) Bracker,F
(2427)-Sousa,H (2174) Fornebu 2016}) 9. g3 {652 A very natural novelty. The
bishop on g2 is not in the way of White's pieces and also protects the e4-pawn,
so the c3-knight can jump to d5 at some point. It is a novelty in this exact
position, since 8...Bh6 is not the main move, but it's a reasonable plan in a
basic position with this structure.} (9. Bd3 {again is possible and played.}
Be6 10. O-O Nge7 11. b3 O-O 12. Bb2 Rb8 13. Qe1 {exotic.} (13. Ncd5 b5 14. Kh1
{would probably be my choice.}) 13... Nd4 14. Ne2 Nec6 15. Nxd4 Nxd4 16. Rd1 b5
{with a complex middlegame, as seen in ½-½ (43) Sanchez Enriquez,O
(2374)-Bogner,S (2603) Barcelona 2014}) 9... Nf6  10. Bg2  O-O  11. O-O  b5 $5
{1066 It's not really a sacrifice, since White can't take the pawn without
suffering serious consequences. Without the inclusion of 11... Rb8, Black's
position has more flexibility and Salem is right in trying to create immediate
counterplay.} 12. f4 $1 {694 A nice move, the position gets chaotic just one
move after both players manage to castle!} (12. cxb5 axb5 13. Nxb5 Ba6 {is the
point of Black's play, and even if White doesn't give up the exchange, the
position is fine.} 14. Qb3 (14. Nxd6 Bxf1 15. Bxf1 Nd4 {is not enough for the
exchange.}) 14... Rb8 15. a4 Nd4 {with a pleasant position.}) 12... exf4 {748
Opening the position is dangerous, White's pieces are better placed than
Black's.} (12... Bg7 {is a strange suggestion. If the idea had been to play
Bg7, then why not just go there at once? But it is playable anyway and quite
interesting.} 13. f5 Nd4 14. Ned5 Nxd5 15. Nxd5 gxf5 16. Qh5 f4 17. gxf4 bxc4
18. fxe5 dxe5 {with a different complex middlegame. Both players have problems
to resolve, but I think I would be more comfortable with White.}) 13. gxf4  Bb7
 14. e5 $1  (14. cxb5 {is also possible, but not in the spirit of the
position.} axb5 15. Nxb5 Ba6 16. e5 Bxb5 17. exf6 Re8 (17... Bxf1 { is
tempting, but the bishop is more important than the rook for the moment.} 18.

position} 16. exf6 Bxe3+ 17. Bxe3 Qxe3+ 18. Rf2 {since Black's queen will have
to leave the diagonal after 19.Nd5, the king is better placed on g1.} (18. Kh1

point: the rook on a8 is hanging.}) 21. Nxf8  Qxh2 {76 The counterplay and the
checks are enough to get one of the knights back, no more than it.} (21... Rxf8
