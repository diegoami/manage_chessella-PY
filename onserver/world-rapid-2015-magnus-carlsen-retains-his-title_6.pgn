{This was the crucial last round. Mamedyarov has a very tiny edge here. If he
could somehow convert this into a win then Magnus would be in trouble as
Nepomniachtchi could catch him. Maybe it was the nervousness of the world title
that caused Magnus to play quite weirdly from this point onwards.} 25... Nd7

trouble. As Alexander Grischuk who came to the commentary room said, "You
cannot just waste 5-6 moves and then be alright!".} Rd8 34. Bc7 $6 ( 34. Rc7

everything is fine.} (34... Rd7 35. Be5 {was what Mamedyarov might have
expected.}) 35. Qxd7 Rxd7 36. Be5 Nh7 37. Rc8+ Nf8 {White has a definite edge
here but the position is just to static to make use of the better placed
pieces. Meanwhile Black has the clear cut idea with f6, Kf7 and Ne6.} 38. Kg3 (

the e6 square for the knight. Mamedyarov would have found this in a classical
game but to do that with very less time on the clock is not at all easy.})
