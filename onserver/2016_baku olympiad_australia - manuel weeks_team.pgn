1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 Nc6 4. Be2 g5 {Not the move many captains want to see
after giving the "play solid as black today" speech at breakfast!} 5. d3 g4 6.
Nfd2 h5 7. Nc3 {An interesting position. The moves g5 and g4 looks very risky
but it is all about the d4 square. The knight from f3 has been forced away.} d6
8. h3 Qf6 {Tactically defending the pawn. Now the value of every move is very
high, one mistake and blacks psotions can fall apart.} 9. Nb3 (9. Nb5 Rb8) 9...

act as it were! Once black finishes development he will be more then ok.} 15.

b6 17. Bf3 O-O-O 18. Ne2 Ng6 {Black has finished his development and has the
d4 square. The "solid" opening has survived and the captains blood pressure
has gone down to semi normal levels!} 19. Rhh1 a5 20. Na1 Nd4 21. Bg4 Nxe2+ 22.
Bxe2 Qg7 23. Nc2 e5 24. f5 Nf4 {All the Nimzo Indian players are now rejoicing.
