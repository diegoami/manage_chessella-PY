{We are currently in one of the most topical positions of
the Queen's Indian Defence 5.Qc2 variation. Svidler of course goes for
the sacrificial attack.} 15. Nxg6 $5 {This same move had been tried by
Radjabov in his game against Leko a few months ago.} hxg6 16. Qxg6+ {Computers
prefer Black at this point, but in a practical game the second player's
task is anything but easy. Look how Karjakin maintains his cool and refutes
the sacrifice.} Kd8 17. a3 { Threatening to trap the knight in the center
of the board with e4.} b5 18. e4 Nb6 19. Nc3 Ne6 (19... d6 {was played
by Leko but after} 20. Bf4 $1 {White had excellent compensation.}) 20.
b4 (20. Nxb5 Qc6 $17) 20... cxb4 (20... Nc4 $5) 21. Nd5 Nf8 22. Qg7 Rh7
23. Qg8 Nxd5 24. exd5 d6 25. axb4 {White's main compensation is the poor
co-ordination of black pieces, but the fact that White cannot really create
dangerous threats helps Black to unravel.} Qf5 26. Be3 a6 27. Rac1 Rc8
28. Bb6+ Ke8 29. h4 Qg6 30. Qxg6+ Nxg6 {Queens are exchanged and Black
was able to make his extra piece count. Svidler must be wondering how
he could have improved his play when the truth is that Karjakin played
almost flawless chess.} 0-1
