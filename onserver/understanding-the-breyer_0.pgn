1. e4 {After the game Kamsky said that he had expected Wesley would play 1.d4}
e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 {Black makes
it clear that he doesn't want anything to do with the Marshall today - it's
time
for the classical main line. Black threatens to win the Ruy Lopez bishop with
Na5 and hence the next move is logical.} 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 {White wants to
play d4.
But immediate 9.d4 is met with Bg4. That too is one of the lines, but Wesley
prefers to go for the absolute main line with h3.} Nb8 $5 {Welcome to the
beautiful word of Breyer where for the best co-ordination people are ready to
undevelop. To bring harmony, Black is ready to go to the extreme. It is in
that sense a very hypermodern idea. The knight on c6 wasn't particularly well
placed. Black would be interested to put his knight on d7 and bishop on b7.
Hence Black goes for the move Nb8.} 10. d4 Nbd7 11. Nbd2 Bb7 12. Bc2 {The
thing I like about the Ruy Lopez is that it is very logical. When White played
d4 Black was in time to play Nbd7 to defend the e5 pawn. Now White over
defends the e4 pawn so that he can continue his journey with Nf1-g3.} Re8 13.
Nf1 Bf8 14. Ng3 {Just in time once again! exd4 is now not a threat as e4 is
not hanging. Now Black first stops the knight coming to f5.} g6 15. Bg5 {
This is the third popular move in the position and the one that was used by
Fischer in his match against Boris Spassky in 1992. The main line is a4 and
the second most popular move is b3.} (15. a4 c5 16. d5 c4 17. Bg5 {was
Anand-Carlsen, Norway 2015 and the absolute main line.}) 15... h6 (15... Bg7
16. Qd2 {And now that h6 is not possible the pin on the diagonal is pretty
irritating.}) 16. Bd2 {The reason for exactly retreating the bishop here is to
keep the e4 pawn defended which wouldn't have happened if bishop was on e3. On
d2 it keeps the rook connected and later Qc1 can attack the h6 pawn.} Bg7 17.
a4 c6 (17... c5 18. d5 c4 19. b4 cxb3 20. Bxb3 Nc5 21. c4 {has been played
before and looks like a small edge for White.}) 18. axb5 axb5 19. Rxa8 Qxa8 {
According to Kamsky after the game he should have taken on a8 with the bishop
and left the queen on d8. But the computer thinks that Kamsky's decision of
Qxa8 was not incorrect.} (19... Bxa8) 20. Nh4 $5 {A very interesting idea by
Wesley. Most probably he had seen something similar at home. He would want to
sacrifice the knight on f5 square.} Qd8 (20... c5 21. d5 $14) (20... exd4 21.
cxd4 c5 22. d5 Qa2 23. Qc1 Nh7 $5 24. b3 h5 25. Nhf5 gxf5 26. Nxf5 $40 {
With attack. Somehow these knights on h4 and g3 are always ready to sacrifice
their lives for the kingside attack. So it looks like a deep idea prepared by
Wesley.}) 21. Qc1 $1 Kh7 $2 (21... Nh7 {looks like a safer solution.} 22. Nhf5
{
is the most logical.} (22. Nf3 h5 {and it doesn't look pretty, but Black can
survive.}) 22... gxf5 23. Nxf5 Re6 24. Bxh6 Bxh6 25. Nxh6+ Kf8 26. Nf5 Rg6 $13
{and Black should be able to defend this.}) 22. Nhf5 $1 {Such sacrifices don't
have to be
seen in too much depth. White gets two pawns and an attack. He isn't risking
so much with this piece sacrifice.} gxf5 23. Nxf5 Re6 24. Bxh6 (24. d5 {
Opening up the c2 bishop would also have been strong.}) 24... Ne8 (24... Nxe4
25. Bxg7 $18) 25. Bg5 $1 Bf6 {This is refuted very nicely.} (25... f6 26. Bh6
$18) (25... Qa8 {But this doesn't feel right.} 26. dxe5 $5 (26. d5 cxd5 27.
exd5 Bxd5 28. Ne7+ Kh8 {There doesn't seem to be a killer blow.}) 26... dxe5 (
26... Nxe5 27. f4 $16) 27. Bb3 $16) 26. Bxf6 $1 Qxf6 (26... Rxf6 27. Qg5 $18)
27. d5 $1 {The rook is almost trapped.} Re7 28. g4 $1 {A very nice finishing
blow. The pawn is coming to g5 and the rook on e7 would be hanging. A fine
game by Wesley.} 1-0
