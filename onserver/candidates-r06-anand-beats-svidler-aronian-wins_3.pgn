Aronian. Previously only Nf5 had been played.} g6 14. Bg5 Rb8 {Here Aronian's
opening knowledge came to an end.} 15. Bf4 $5 Rc8 16. Bh6 {The idea with this
Bg5-f4-h6 is to lure the rook to c8 before bringing the queen to f4 so that Qb8
is not possible.} Re8 17. Qf4 Na5 (17... Nh5 {was definitely what Levon was

the open d-file in his control and a more active king. This should mean

Rxc2 Rxa5 {This is the endgame position which Aronian thinks that he was
winning even if Nakamura didn't blunder. In the game he moved around a bit with
his pieces. In the analysis he began with h5 as the right way for White to
proceed.} 62. Rc4 (62. h5 Rb5 63. Rc8 Ra5 64. Rd8 Ra4 65. Kg4 Rb4 66. Kf3 {
[%cal Gf4f5] This is all still main line of the analysis. According to Levon
White threatens f5 here and it is a deadly idea.} Rb3+ 67. Ke4 {And now
Kosteniuk played Rb1. Instead Rh3 can be a strong move.} Rb1 {Even this is not
so clear as after} (67... Rh3 $1 68. f5 Rh4+ 69. Kd5 Rxh5 70. f6+ Kg6 $11) 68.

{Nakamura made this move and this led to the j'adoube controversy. Maybe Naka
didn't realise that Kf6 Ra6+ can now be met with Rd6. When he touched the king
he must have realized it. Or else he could have just played Ra4.} (74... Ra4
