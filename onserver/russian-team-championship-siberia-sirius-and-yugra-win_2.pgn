1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Nf3 d5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 O-O 7. a4 $6 { I'm
not familiar with this move, and I'm afraid, it is not very good. The idea of
putting the bishop on a3 works well in the Evans Gambit, but here Black has
already castled.} (7. e3 {is standard issue.}) 7... b6 8. Ne5 $6 (8. cxd5 exd5
9. Bg5) 8... Nfd7 9. Qd3 $6 {Fedoseev seems to be determined to wipe his
opponent clean off the board. I guess, having 5/6 does wonders for one's
confidence.} Nxe5 10. dxe5 Nc6 ({On} 10... Ba6 {White has} 11. e4 Bxc4 12. Qg3
{but the same idea} f5 13. exf6 Qxf6 {defends successfully.}) 11. Qg3 f6 $1 {
Indicating that White will not be given a free ride on the K-side.} 12. exf6
Qxf6 13. Bg5 Qf5 14. h4 Ba6 (14... d4 $5 {would probably do a quicker job.})
15. h5 Bxc4 16. Rh4 Qf7 ({More convincing was} 16... Rf7 17. e4 Qe5 {Why not
force the queens off when the opportunity is there?}) 17. e4 Bxf1 {Black begins
to slip up a bit. He didn't have to help the white king escape.} (17... e5 18.
Bxc4 dxc4 19. Rd1 Rae8 20. Rg4 Re6 {would keep White from making any threats,
and Black's Q-side pawn majority wouldn't have to wait long for its turn.}) 18.
Kxf1 dxe4 $2 {Opening the position is wrong in principle, plus the white rook
is glad to accept the invitation to join the game.} 19. h6 g6 20. Rxe4 e5 21.
Rae1 {White has full compensation, so Fedoseev's liberties in the opening will
go unpunished. This time.} Rae8 22. Kg1 Qd7 23. Qe3 Re6 24. Qe2 Rd6 $2 (24...
Rf5 $11) 25. f4 $1 exf4 $2 26. Be7 $1 {Just like that White is winning the
exchange and the game with it.} Rd2 27. Qc4+ Rf7 28. Ba3 Rd1 29. Qe2 Rxe1+ 30.
