looks like an unlikely candidate for a fortress. But around this point, I
realised that in fact I only need to push ...g5 and transfer my bishop from e6
to g6 and White would in fact have no way in.} 46. f3 Ba2 47. Qe7 {This is a
step in the wrong direction- simply restricting my king a tiny bit more isn't
a winning plan because I didn't want to move it anyway.} (47. Kf2 Bb1 48. Qc1

Now there will be no fortress: White wants Qb5 and f5 next.}) 47... Bb1 48. Kf2

simply by shortening the b1-h7 diagonal with} 48. g5 {. I suspect not, because

bishop away, which is a prerequisite for bringing the king in without facing ..

tight. However, it could be that White has a clever way to arrange to trap the
bishop using some tactics on the h-file.}) (48. Qb4 {or something else that
disrupts ...g5 would win too, because White's plan is not time-critical.})

draw, or not...} 1/2-1/2
