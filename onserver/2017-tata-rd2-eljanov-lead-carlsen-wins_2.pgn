1. e4  e5  2. Nf3  Nc6  3. Bb5 {6 This time Harikrishna chooses the Ruy Lopez
over Guioco Piano. The latter he used successfully to beat Sergey Karjakin at
the Olympiad.} a6  4. Ba4  Nf6  5. O-O  b5  6. Bb3  Bc5 $5 {1 The Arkhangelsk
Variation of the Ruy Lopez which is much more active than the closed Ruy Lopez,
but also riskier.} 7. c3  d6  8. d4  Bb6  9. Be3  O-O  (9... Nxe4 10. Bd5 $18)
10. h3  (10. Nbd2 {is more common.}) 10... exd4 {666 Adhiban has already played
this before against Kuzubov in 2011, but he thought for 11 minutes which means
that he wasn't expecting this line.} 11. cxd4  Nxe4 {11 Seeing that nothing is
wrong with grabbing the pawn, Adhiban goes ahead.} 12. Bd5 {618 Harikrishna
also thought for 10 minutes recollecting his lines.} Qe8 $1  13. Qc2  Nb4  14.
Qxe4  Qxe4  15. Bxe4  d5 {2 And the bishop is trapped in a very novel manner.}
16. Bxh7+  Kxh7 {2 Overall it would seem that the central e4 pawn is much more
important than the h7 pawn. And this is true. Black has a very comfortable
position. But it's a complex middlegame, so both sides have to play
accurately.} 17. Nc3  c6 {1426 23 minutes for the move c6. Adhiban would have
surely been looking at ...Nc2 options. Finally he didn't like them and
continued with this little pawn move.} (17... Nc2 18. Rac1 Nxe3 19. fxe3 Bb7
20. Ne5 {Somehow I feel that the bishops are a tad too passive.}) 18. Rad1  a5 
19. a3  Nc2  20. Rd2  Nxe3  21. fxe3 {10 The computers like Black's position
because of the bishop pair. Objectively the position is equal. But with all
these imbalances, the situation is rich and the better player has chances to
outplay his opponent.} f6  22. Rc1  Bd7  23. Kf2 {117 Hari just makes normal,
natural moves, not worrying about what he is trying to achieve in the position.
If his pieces are on good squares something will turn up. That being said
Adhiban has nothing to worry. His position is at least equal, maybe even
slightly better.} Rae8  24. Ne2  Re7  (24... g5 $5 $15) 25. Nf4  Rfe8  ( 25...
g5 26. Nd3 Kg7 27. Nc5 Bf5 $15) 26. Re2  g5  27. Nd3  Kg7  28. Nc5  Bf5  29.

h3 pawn is weak.} 31. Rh1 Bxc5 $1 32. dxc5 (32. Rxc5 Bxg4 $15) 32... Kg6 33.

{165 Adhiban must have felt that Hari would be fine with a draw. After all it's
not so easy to make progress. But Harikrishna fights on.} 32. g4  Bc8  33. Nd3 
Bd7  (33... Rc7 $5 {makes sense in order to take on g4 when h4 is played.} )
34. h4 $1 {84 Very alert.} gxh4  35. Nxh4+  Kg5 {204 The king has to move in.
But as we already know, the knight are tricky creatures. Hence, Black must
remain careful.} (35... Kh7 36. Nf5 Bxf5 37. gxf5 Rc7 38. Rh1+ Kg7 39. Rcg1+
$19) 36. Nf3+  Kxg4 {157 Good or bad, this pawn had to taken.} ( 36... Kg6 37.
g5 $1 fxg5 38. Nde5+ Kf5 39. Rg1 $16) 37. Rh1 $1 {230 The black king is
beginning to feel uncomfortable. Two knights and two rooks are trying to trap
it.} Kf5 {225 Adhiban's king makes a dash.} 38. Rh5+  Ke6  ( 38... Kg6 39. Nf4+

do you see the Lawnmower's mate at such a high level! A very interesting game
where Harikrishna showed that practically he is a stronger player.} 1-0
