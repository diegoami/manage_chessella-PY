$2 {White's pawns are certainly weak, and ripe for the picking, but Black
needs to consider actually capturing them since at some point White isn't
going to just leave them lying around.} (14... Bxe5 $1 15. Nxe5 Qxe5 {and the
game is balanced, but perhaps that is precisely what Sutovsky was not seeking.
Part of the problem is that while Sutovsky is rightly famed for his incredibly
imaginative play, Korobov is no slouch in the creativity department either.})

the most obvious choice in the position.} Rxd7 19. Qxd7 Kf7 20. Rd1 $1 {
[#] White's nasty plans for Black's king are no secret, but Black misses some
of concrete threats he faces. There is a saying: "Defense is 98% tactics."
This position illustrates that aphorism.} Bxe5 $2 {[%tqu "En","White find a
fantastic winner here. Can you do as well? White to play and win.","","",

double attack, forcing Black to recapture.",10]} 21. Rd5 $3 {A truly beautiful
