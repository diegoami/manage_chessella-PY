{"This was played in the 6th round of the Kocaeli province chess championship.
My opponent Aşkın Taşan has several times beeen champion of the province.
Although I had a good position after the opening and had good attacking
chances, I could not find the killer blow. I calculated a lot and sought the
right continuation/plans a lot but only lost a lot of time. In the endgame
phase I was one pawn up and stood well positionally but was in severe time trouble.
As a result I lost. But I think the game is worth to look at and I
decided to share with you as my "agony" game. I choose it because I
understand that being positionally better or materially up (a pawn) against a
better player does not mean that you will win the game."} 1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6

moves are utterly crucial. White can now either keep the tension or try to
resolve the centre to his advantage. My first thought was to try cxd5 and if
exd5 dxc5 hoping to leave Black with either a slightly weak pawn on e4 or an
isolated d-pawn. but it isn't very convincing since Black has many options.}

Ayhan resigned. A very sad end to an extremely complicated game in which, up
to this point, Ayhan had played well. He took advantage of his opponent's bad
resolution of the centre to gain a nice advantage which he increased with the
excellent Nf6-g4 and back again after h3, creating serious dark square
weaknesses around the enemy king. In the critical phase, Rd3 was strong but
from a practical point of view h6 would have perhaps been even better,
avoiding back rank disasters as actually occured in the game and putting the
ball back into his opponent's court.} (33. Qf4 h6 34. Qb8+ Kh7 35. Qxb7 f6 (

quite well until 16...e4? blunder move but I did not give up the game.
The next 5-6 moves my opponent could not understand the game positionally I think,
although he had quite good chances I was aware of the white king’s back rank
weakness and when the right moment came I benefited with the interesting 26...
Nb3! idea. I chose the game because I did not give up and I believe that I
played positionally good chess in the game. I created weaknesess in the
opponent's camp and finally benefited with the Nb3 idea which increased the
complications over the board. My oponent could not find the right continuation
due to complications and physiological tensions as well."} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6
