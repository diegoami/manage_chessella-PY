Kh7 {[#] White has a strong centre and has already positioned his forces
against the black King, although an breakthrough is not immediately
evident. Better but not winning is often a difficult spot to be in.} 14.
0-0 c5 15. d5 Nc4 16. Bg5 Nde5 $6 {Exchanging a piece to relieve the
pressure is tempting, but this only helps White. The f3-knight had
nowhere meaningful to go, but its disappearance, on the other hand,
makes way for f2-f4, reinforcing the attack.} (16... Nxb2 {was
possible.} )17. Nxe5 Nxe5 18. Rad1 ({Consequently, White now has} 18. f4

position up a pawn.} )c4 $1 {Black gives his knight a secure base on d3,
which, if it could be maintained, might be enough to keep the game
balanced.} 19. b3 {Naturally, White has other ideas.} Qc7 20. Kh1 {[#] White would like to play f2-f4 without worrying about any queen checks along the g1-a7 diagonal.} Rfe8 {With this move Black completely loses the thread. Because white plans to open the f-file at any moment, it would have been much more useful to guard the f-file and prevent an incursion on f7.
The e7-pawn could have been covered by the a-rook. A plan to activate that rook via the c-file would both been too slow and not directed
against meaningful targets.} ({Important was} 20... b5 $1 {to hold the d3-square at all costs. Together with the queen (and supported by the g7-bishop) Black's knight would have significant claim to key dark squares, which might tie down White's forces to defensive rolls.} )21. f4 Nd3 $2 {Now
he returns ruefully to his original plan, but it's no longer working and the black position soon collapses.} 22. bxc4 $1 {This simple move makes a big statement.} Nb2 23. Rc1 Nxc4 24. f5 {fxg6+ is coming with threats of Rf7.} Rf8 25.
