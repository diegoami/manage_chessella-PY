1. e4 {"I don't often open with 1.e4, but when I do..." would be a great
opening line for a chess TV commercial.} c5 {Joel took a moment or two to
decide on this one.} ({I expected} 1... e5) 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 {
I breathed a sigh of relief.} 5. Nb5 {This had been played by Karpov about a
couple of dozen times, but the game everybody remembers is his loss to
Kasparov in Game 16 of their 1985 match.} d6 6. c4 {The game has transposed to
a Hedgehog formation, which essentually is a closed opening, so my 1.e4 salvo
went unpunished.} a6 (6... Nf6 {is much more common. After some obvious
developing moves,} 7. N1c3 (7. N5c3 {is possible, but it's usually associated
with a different plan,} b6 8. Be2 Bb7 9. O-O Be7 10. Bf4) 7... a6 8. Na3 Be7 9.
Be2 {are played Black might want to stop and, instead of the expected} O-O ({
consider} 9... b6 10. O-O Bb7 11. Be3 Nb8 $5 {to force White into a modest
setup with} 12. f3 Nbd7) 10. O-O b6 11. Be3 Ne5 12. f4 Ned7 13. Bf3 Bb7 {
In this position, which has been seen quite a few times. White tries to
combine the restrictive approach of a Maroczy Bind with aggressive K-side
attacks typical of Open Sicilians. The results are often disastrous for him.})
7. N5c3 Nf6 8. Be2 Be7 9. O-O b6 10. Be3 Bb7 {[#]} ({In case of the above
mentioned knight repositioning} 10... Ne5 11. f4 Ned7 {White can do the same
with his own knight,} 12. Nd2 {heading out to greener pastures that the old
a3-patch.}) {Here I quickly settled on anotehr Karpov's idea} 11. Qb3 $5 {
The point is to disrupt the coordination of the black pieces by forcing the
wrong knight to come to d7.} Nd7 12. Rd1 O-O 13. Na3 $6 {I wasn't sure about
that one. I knew that with a different move order 6...a6 White would be forced
to keep his knights on c3 and a3.} ({Therefore I wanted to exercise my} 13. Nd2
{option. Then the plan Joel used in the game,} Nc5 14. Qc2 Nb4 15. Qb1 Bf6 {
would allow White to defend with.} 16. Nf1 Qc7 17. Ng3 {Before the reader
spots this and exclaims, see, you said it yourself, you are defending with
White, what kind of thing is that? You should play a better opening next time,
etc.  I'd mention that such is the nature of many early middlegames stemming
out of 1.d4: White builds to last, but he needs to apply prophylactic measures
against Black's disruptive tactics, in order for his setup to be completed,
and then, hopefully, in the not so distant future he will be able to enjoy the
fruits of his labor.}) 13... Nc5 {Joel took quite a bit of time here, but not
for nothing, as he worked out a plan of counterplay.} 14. Qc2 Bf6 $1 15. Rac1 {
I thought it was clever to ignore the threat of Bxc3.} ({Better was} 15. f3 Be5
16. Qd2 Qh4 17. g3 Qf6 18. Rac1) 15... Nb4 $1 {Benjamin prefers to change the
character of the game and I completely agree with him.} ({A lesser player
might have gone} 15... Be5 {and let me play the one move I needed,} 16. Nab1 $1
Qf6 17. Qd2 Qg6 18. f4 Bf6 19. Bf3 {and then everything falls in place.}) 16.
Qd2 Bxc3 17. bxc3 Nxe4 18. Qb2 Nc6 {[#]} 19. Qxb6 {This isn't going to cut it.}
({White needed to start with} 19. c5 $1 {although the real work is only about
to begin after} Ne7 20. cxb6 Nf5) 19... Qe7 20. Bf3 $2 {The second weak move
in a row.} (20. c5 d5 21. f3 Nf6 22. Nc2 $14) 20... f5 ({I think I'd find
myself in trouble after} 20... Ne5 {as the line I was looking at,} 21. Bxe4
Bxe4 22. Qxd6 ({I'd have to settle for} 22. Qd4 Bxg2 23. Kxg2 Qb7+ 24. Kf1 $11)
22... Qf6 23. Bd4 {gets busted by} Qg5) 21. Bxe4 fxe4 22. Nc2 {[#]} Ne5 {
I didn't think it was possible.} 23. Qxd6 (23. c5 d5 24. Nd4 Rae8 25. c6 Bc8
$15) 23... Qxd6 24. Rxd6 Nxc4 25. Rd7 ({It still took me a minute to realize
the pawn was taboo:} 25. Rxe6 Kf7 26. Nd4 Bd5) 25... Rf7 26. Rcd1 Bd5 27. Rxf7
Kxf7 28. Nb4 Nxe3 {liquidating.} ({Could Black have tried for more?} 28... a5
