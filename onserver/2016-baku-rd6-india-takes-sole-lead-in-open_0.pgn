{India-Netherlands was the crucial match of round six. The winner of this match
would take the sole lead in the event at this point. In what turned out to be a
close match, Erwin L'Ami's decisive blunder turned out to be the pivotal factor
in India's victory.} 1. d4  Nf6  2. c4  e6  3. Nc3  Bb4  4. Qc2  Nc6 $5 {(0s)

know what the point of this novelty is. Maybe it was Adhiban's improvisation.}

White is ahead in development and opens up the game in the center!} 14. f4 $1

consideration. I do not believe that Black would want to touch his e-pawn in
any case. A move which will leave White with a monster on c3.}) 16... c6

Black needs to do something!} 17. dxc6  bxc6  18. Ne4  Nxe4  19. Bxe4  Ra6  20.

this position. He believed that if you have opposite colored bishops when you
have the initiative it is as you were already a piece up in your attack!}) 21.

square of d5 to shut down White's bishop on c3.} 22. Rxd6 $6 {(186s) L'Ami
senses the danger and transforms the position into an endgame with equal but
unbalanced material. Nevertheless, he still makes Black's task easier. It would
have been better if he had kept the tension in this position.} Rxd6  23. fxe5

(17s) White has two pawns for the sacrificed exchange, nevertheless, Black can
always return the exchange and get a position in which he has a slight edge.

better practical chances.} Ba6  28. Bc6  Re2  29. Bd5  Re7  30. Bf6  Re8  31.
