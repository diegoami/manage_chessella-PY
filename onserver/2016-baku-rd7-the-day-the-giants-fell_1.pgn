Ne5 a6 9. f3 $5 {A new idea, perhaps, playing against the bishop. The computer
doesn't approve, but what do they know.} Bf5 10. g4 Bg6 (10... b5 {is necessary
according to the mechanical brain, let's analyze a little bit why:} 11. Qd1
Nxe5 $1 (11... Bg6 12. h4 {is the game}) 12. dxe5 (12. gxf5 Nc4 { doesn't make
sense for White.}) 12... Nxg4 13. fxg4 Qh4+ 14. Kd2 Bxg4 {And Black's pair of
bishops, better structure and better king give him enough compensation for the
piece. Is this easy to evaluate during the game? No, quite the contrary.}) 11.
h4 b5 12. Qd1 b4 13. h5 $1 Bxh5 14. Nxd7 (14. Ne2 $1 {is a very computer like
move} Bg6 15. Nxg6 fxg6 16. Nf4 Kf7 17. e4 $1 { With a big initiative.}) 14...
Nxd7 15. Rxh5 $2 {This move is strange, though, it makes sense to eliminate d5}
(15. Nxd5 Bg6 (15... exd5 16. Rxh5 Bd6 17. Kf2 {also looks very good for
Shankland.}) 16. Nf4 {still gains the pair of bishops, and the central pawn
mass gives White a big advantage.}) 15... bxc3 16. bxc3 Qc7 {The pressure on c3
now gives Black counterplay, not to mention d5 is not a weakness anymore.} 17.
Bd2 Bd6 18. Bd3 Nb6 19. Ke2 h6 20. g5 Kd7 $5 {With the kings in the center,
anything can happen!} 21. gxh6 gxh6 22. Rb1 Rag8 23. Bxa6 $2 {a bit greedy,
there was no reason to allow the move Rg2+.} (23. Qh1 $13 Nc4 $1) (23. Kf2 $1
{is a move so brave I wouldn't really consider it.} ) 23... Rg2+ 24. Kd3 $2
{Shankland seriously underestimates the attack.} (24. Kf1 Rhg8 25. Rh1 {keeps
White afloat, though his position is obviously grim.}) 24... Ra8 25. Bb5+ Kd8
26. Rxh6 Rxa2 {It seems like White has threats, but in truth it is only a few
checks.} 27. Rh8+ Ke7 28. Re8+ Kf6 29. Be1 Kg7 30. f4 { With Black's king safe
on g7, it is time for him to restart his attack.} f5 31. Qb3 Qf7 (31... Ra3 32.
Rb2 Rxb3 33. Rxg2+ Kf7 34. Reg8 $1 {And Black is the one that has to be
careful} Bf8 35. Rh8 $1 {And things are far, far from clear. }) (31... Rh2 $1
{was winning, threatening now Ra3,}) 32. Qd1 Nc4 33. Rd8 $1 { After this move
Sethuraman fell to below two minutes, with many moves to go the win is not easy
to find.} Be7 $6 (33... Nxe3 $1 34. Kxe3 (34. Qc1 Qh5 $19) 34... Bxf4+ $1
{Nothing else works.} 35. Kxf4 (35. Kd3 Qh5 $1 {is the prettiest.} 36. Qxh5

Nb2+ 35. Rxb2 Rgxb2 {at least won the exchange} 36. Bh4 Bxh4 37. Rxf7+ Kxf7 $19
{But the evaluation I gave at the end is very computer like. With two minutes
on the clock who knows if White has a perpetual or more. }) 35. Bxc4 dxc4+ 36.
