cxd4 9. Nb3 {This line of the King's Indian is currently quite popular. White
attacks the black queen and next move he wants to take on d4 to get a
comfortable and pleasant Maroczy-structure. However, Black counters with a
surprise:} Qxc3+ $1 {Officially a novelty but there's a good chance that
King's Indian aficionados analysed this move before.} 10. bxc3 dxe3 11. f3 Nh5
{Black has two pieces for the queen but one of these pieces is the King's
Indian bishop on g7. Despite the material advantage the position is much more
difficult to play for White - the engines evaluate it as about equal which
usually is a bad sign for the side which is material up.} 12. Qc1 Bh6 13. g4
Nf4 14. Kd1 Ne6 15. Kc2 Nc6 16. h4 Bf4 17. Qd1 Ne5 18. Nc1 Bd7 {Black calmly
develops and his two minor pieces seem to be much more active and stronger
than White's queen.} 19. a4 Rac8 20. Ne2 Bh6 21. g5 Bg7 22. Bh3 Nxf3 23. Qd3
Ne5 24. Qxe3 Nxc4 25. Qf2 Rc5 {Black continues to calmly increase the pressure.
} 26. Rhb1 Bc6 27. Bg2 f5 28. gxf6 Bxf6 29. Rf1 Bxc3 $1 {The beginning of a
tactical sequence that gives Black a better endgame.} 30. Qxc5 Nxc5 31. Rxf8+
Kxf8 32. Kxc3 Ne5 {Black now has three pawns and a dominating position for the
exchange.} 33. a5 Nxe4+ 34. Bxe4 Bxe4 35. Nd4 Bd5 36. Nb5 a6 37. Nc7 Bc6 38.
