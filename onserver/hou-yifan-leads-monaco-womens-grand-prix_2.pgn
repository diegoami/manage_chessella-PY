{Black's last move was Rg8-g7 offering the exchange of rooks. Of course the
first instinct is not to exchange, but if you delve deeper you will realize
that there is no way for Black to break through!} 88. Ra4 (88. Rxg7 $1 Kxg7 89.

to draw the game. It is important that when Black goes Ke6, you are ready to
meet it with Kg5 attacking the g6 pawn.} (90. Kd5 Kf6 91. Kd6 f4 92. gxf4 Kf5
