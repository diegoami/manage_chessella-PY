{I must say it took me some time to decide whether I should introduce this
game or not, as it brings back less pleasant memories from my last round, when
I missed a great chance to win a rather substantial ladies prize, rating and a
beautiful game. I lost it all but there was one moment which (even for me,
during the game!) brought a smile on my face. Can you find the continuation
for Black?} 31... Qa5 $1 {A blow out of nowhere!! After all, it was about time
for Alan to prove the power of the queen on a5, which didn't work against
Adams but did a pretty good job against me:)} 32. Rad1 {What else? There is no
way to prevent material loss or the 1st rank mate.} ({For example} 32. Rg1 {
runs into the same idea} Qxd2) ({Or} 32. Rdd1 Qxa1) 32... Qxd2 $1 {Oups! Great
geometric eye and intuition, since Alan admitted he saw Qa5 only in the very
last moment, with less than 10 seconds on the clock!} 33. Qxd2 Nf2+ 34. Qxf2
Rxf2 {The remaining moves are of no relevance but the tactic can go straight
into the books. Pitty I had to be the one to witness it up close:)} 0-1
