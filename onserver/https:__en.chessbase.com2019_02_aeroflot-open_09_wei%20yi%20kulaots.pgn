Kaido - "I replied to his 1.e4 with my customary move in this tournament –
1…c5. He chose the closed Sicilian. I was aware of the variation that Wei Yi
chose (it had been practiced by Rapport amongst others), but I had not really
checked this line for a long time. It led me trying to be very smart and
original right from the early stages. It backfired most horribly as White
ended up getting about as much as one could ever dream from such an
unpretentious line as the Closed Sicilian."} 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. Nge2 Nf6 4.

As Kaido said in his interview, "When Wei Yi entered my position with his rook
on c6, he must have been so happy with his position and future prospects."}
Rad8 {Kaido: "I simply protected my d6 pawn with Rad8. Ok, I self pin my f6
knight, but so what. I keep the material balance and plan to continue doing so
for the time to come. On his next move Wei Yi spent incredible amount of time.
On one hand it was a notoriously difficult choice between many good
continuations, on the other – how to really break through Black's position
that looks so shaky? His decision to give up his dark squared bishop was very
committal, but the idea being understandable – he wanted to dominate me
completely on light squares. Then the checkers started, just that white was
playing on light and black on dark squares."} (20... Nxd5 21. Rxd6 $18) 21.

king to g2 and shows that everything is fine in his position.} b3 {Kaido - "It
was a beautiful practical chance. Without even changing the objective
evaluation of the position! It still remained within the equality, but the
character of it changed considerably. True, White was now 1.5 pawns up, but
instead of one open file, which was by now under the lock and key of white's
monarch, Black could dream about using open files on the queenside too."} 45.
