Bf4 { (59s) And this is already a novelty. It seems strange to give up the c4
bishop in this postion when it can still exert considerable force, all to save
a tempo, but the you Dutchman has his ideas to blitzkrieg his opponent.} Be7 
8. O-O-O  Nxc4 $2 {(168s) This is a mistake for several reasons. In spite of
complaining about giving up the bishop couple of moves ago, a lot can change in
a couple of moves. Black has now spent three tempi to capture this bishop with
his knight, but his king is still in the center, and White's queen is not
poorly placed on c4. In fact, now that 0-0-0 has been played, the rook is aimed
straight at the black queen.} 9. Qxc4  O-O  10. Rhe1  ({Why be gun shy now?}
10. e5 $1 {is both unsubtle and strong.}) 10... Be6  11. Qf1  Qc8  12. Nd4  Bd7
{(97s) This is incredibly risky. It might seem as if nothing is happening just
yet, but White has great piece placement with the excpetion of the queen on f1,
lots of central control, and the kingside pawns can rain hail and fire much
quicker than Black's. Black needed to start taking active measures with Nd7,
Bf6 and start his pawns rolling, than this passive choice.} 13. f3  Rb8  14. g4
