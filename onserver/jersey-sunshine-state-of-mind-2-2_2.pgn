{After quite an interesting strategic battle in the opening and middlegame, it
was about time for Black to harvest, so I went:} 45... Nc3+ {planning that
after} 46. Bxc3 {to go not what followed in the game} dxc3 ({but} 46... Bxg3 {
instead, as} 47. a7 Kb7 {leads to nothing but a totally winning position for
yours truly. The black pawns' chain is incredibly strong and there is nothing
White can do to stop the malvolent plan of collecting the h2 pawn and then
queening. No idea what has happened to my brain, besides the fact I decided to
take a shortcut since I honestly believed the ensuing pawn endgame after 46...
dxc3 should be winning much easier...Was it?!}) 47. Nxd6 cxd6 48. Kb3 Kb6 49.
Kxc3 {All fine, until I went astray with} d5 $2 {Obviously my last move was
meant to meet 50.d4 with 50...c4, where I thought Black should be kind of
winning. Even in the worst possible scenario, I can still give up the c-pawn
and enter with the king to the weak d4-pawn. I was so convinced of my wrong
opinion that my opponent missed his chance, perhaps precisely because of that
reason?} ({The right way to go was} 49... Kxa6 50. d4 ({If} 50. Kc4 {the only
way to win is with} f4 $1 (50... Kb6 $2 51. d4 f4 52. gxf4 gxf4 53. dxc5+ dxc5
54. Kc3 {with a draw, as mentioned in a similar line below.}) 51. gxf4 gxf4 52.
d4 cxd4 53. Kxd4 Kb5 54. Ke4 d5+ $1 55. Kxf4 d4 56. Ke4 Kc4 {which is also
transposes to a line underneath; Black is winning.}) 50... Kb5 51. dxc5 Kxc5 $1
(51... dxc5 $2 {would again hand White half a point as there is no way Black
can breakthrough! A sample line:} 52. Kb3 c4+ 53. Kc3 Kc5 54. Kc2 Kb4 55. Kb2
c3+ 56. Kc2 Kc4 57. Kc1 Kb3 58. Kb1 c2+ 59. Kc1 {And now a handshake would do..
. impossible to avoid stalemate.}) 52. Kd3 f4 53. gxf4 gxf4 54. Ke4 d5+ 55.
Kxf4 d4 56. Ke4 Kc4 57. f4 Kc3 58. f5 d3 59. f6 dxe2 60. f7 e1=Q 61. f8=Q Qb1+
{and now with a couple of smart checks, the point should go into Black's
pockets. Somehow I feel that calculating all of it with 30 seconds on the clock
is not so easy. That means I should have definitely taken on g3, forget about
the piece and simply roll the pawns over! And I should study some more pawn
endgames too...} 62. Ke5 Qb5+ 63. Ke6 Qc4+ 64. Kd7 e2) 50. f4 $2 {This move is
too committal, since there will be no more fortresses in the position - Black
can go around the board and enter via h5-g4-f4.} ({A draw would have been
achieved after} 50. d4 c4 51. Kb4 f4 {Aimed to protect the e3-pawn in a line
that will be reveled further on.} 52. gxf4 gxf4 53. Kc3 Kxa6 54. Kb4 Kb6 55.
Ka4 c3 {Black has to sacrifice the pawn to be able to enter with the king.} 56.
Kb3 Kb5 57. Kxc3 Ka4 58. Kc2 $1 {opposition} Kb4 59. Kd3 Kb3 {stalemate
again.}) 50... gxf4 51. gxf4 Kxa6 52. d4 c4 53. Kb4 Kb6 54. Ka4 Kc6 {Pfiuu, the
morning game was over:)} 0-1
