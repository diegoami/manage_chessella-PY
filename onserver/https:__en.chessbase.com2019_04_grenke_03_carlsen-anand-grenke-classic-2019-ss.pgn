1. c4 e5 2. g3 {Vishy is used to meeting Nc3 with Bb4 and hence Magnus went
for g3.} Nf6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {If not on move two, then move three! But Vishy has to
play Bb4!} 4. e4 $5 {This was the same move that Magnus played against Caruana
at the World Championships 2018 in the rapid phase. It was clear that Anand
had come prepared for it.} Bxc3 5. dxc3 d6 ({The pawn cannot be won as after} 
5... Nxe4 6. Qd5 (6. Qg4 {is also interesting.}) 6... Nf6 7. Qxe5+ Qe7 8. Qxe7+
Kxe7 9. Bg2 $14 {White has a small but persistent edge.}) 6. f3 $5 {The most
natural move would be to play Bg2. But Magnus has different ideas. He doesn't
want his bishop to be on g2. Rather he would like to naturally place it on d3
and the knight will come into the game from h3 to f2. All of this had already
been seen in Carlsen's game against Nikita Petrov from the World Rapid
Championships 2018.} a5 (6... Be6 7. Nh3 h6 8. Nf2 a5 9. f4 Na6 10. f5 Bd7 11.

-Petrov,N (2593) St Petersburg 2018}) 7. Nh3 $5 (7. Bd3 Be6 8. Ne2 {The knight
is not so well placed here. Carlsen would like to use the e2 square for his
queen and the knight would do better on f2.}) 7... a4 {The first new move of
the game. Until now the players were following Svidler vs Tomashevsky.} 8. Nf2
Be6 9. Bd3 Nbd7 10. Qe2 c6 $6 (10... Nc5 11. Bc2 Nfd7 12. Nd1 Nb6 13. Ne3 {
White seems to have stabilised his position. Yet, this might be a better way
to play than what Vishy did in the game.}) 11. f4 $1 {Carlsen is extremely
alert and now threatens to trap the bishop on e6 with f5.} Nb6 (11... Nc5 12.
f5 Bc8 13. Bc2 $16) 12. Be3 {White has just free flowing development and Black
has absolutely no plans in the position. Anand understands the gravity of the
situation and tries to take some desperate measures.} c5 13. O-O-O (13. fxe5 {
This would win a pawn, but Anand hoped that it would give him enough
compensation and activity in return.} dxe5 14. Bxc5 Qc7 15. Bb4 Nxc4 16. O-O-O
$36) 13... Qe7 14. f5 {Magnus now gains a lot of space on the kingside.} Bd7
15. g4 h6 16. h4 {Let's just take a stock of the situation. White has more
space, he has the bishop pair and there is a huge pawn storm coming down his
throat. And not to forget, the player with the white pieces is Magnus Carlsen!}
O-O-O 17. g5 Ne8 18. Bd2 {Magnus prepares b4.} hxg5 19. hxg5 Nc7 20. Ng4 Rdg8

Rxh7 Rh8 {Vishy manages to exchange both the pair of rooks. His position
remains quite difficult, but at least psychologically you have lesser pieces
to worry about in this cramped position.} 28. Qh2 (28. Rxg7 Qf8 {traps the
rook.}) (28. g6 $1 {Was a finish that Magnus missed.} fxg6 29. Rxg7 gxf5 30.
exf5 $18 {The active pieces combined with the f-pawn gives White a winning
edge.}) 28... Rxh7 29. Qxh7 Qf8 30. Ne3 Ne7 31. Kc2 Qg8 32. Qh4 Qf8 {This is
not Anand's style to wait passively, but here he has no option.} 33. Kd1 Nc6
34. Qh7 Ne7 35. Ke2 Nc8 36. Kf2 Ne7 37. Be2 Qg8 38. Qh1 (38. Qxg8+ Nxg8 39. Nd5
{Should also be clearly better, but Carlsen wanted to keep the queens on and
understandably so.}) 38... g6 $1 {A great decision to try and clarify the pawn
structure on the kingside. Now Carlsen has to constantly worry about whether
black will take on f5 or not. Meanwhile he has three options. Pushing to f6,
taking on g6 and letting things remain as they are! Not so easy to decide,
which one is the best.} 39. Qh6 (39. f6 Nc6 {give Black some squares to play
with.}) 39... Ne8 (39... gxf5 40. Qxd6 $18) 40. f6 Nc6 41. b4 $5 Nc7 (41...
cxb4 42. cxb4 Nd4 43. b5 $16 {Yes, Black has the d4 square, but apart from
that nothing else is going his way and Bb4 is a big threat.}) 42. bxc5 dxc5 43.
Nd5 Ne6 44. Be3 Ka7 45. Bg4 b6 46. Nc7 Qc8 47. Nb5+ Kb8 {White is trying hard
to break in, but it is not so easy.} 48. Nd6 (48. Qh7 Ned8 $1 $11) 48... Qg8
49. Qh1 Qf8 50. Qd1 Ncd8 51. Nb5 Bc6 (51... Bxb5 52. cxb5 Kc7 $16 {White is of
course better here as well. But Black has some defensive chances in the
position.}) 52. Kg1 $1 {The idea of this move is pretty simple. White wants to
play his bishop to g3 via f2. It's never easy to make such king moves, but
Magnus is quite good at that!} Nc7 $2 {A big error. After this Black is lost.}
53. Bf2 Nb7 54. Bg3 Bxb5 55. cxb5 Qd6 {Somehow Anand is trying to minimize the
damage. Now White has multiple ways to win, but all of them revolve around
exchanging the queen and then using the two bishops to win the game. The most
interesting way is to play Kg2 and the idea is that after the queen exchange,
when a knight comes from d6-e4-c3, then there is no check on e2 and hence Kg2
is an ultra prophylactic move that is completely winning. Magnus tries to keep
the queens on and this easies Anand's defensive task.} 56. Qe2 $2 {The idea is
to play Qh2, but I think Carlsen missed that Ne6-f4 would be a strong idea.} (
56. Kg2 $1 Z0 57. Qxd6 Nxd6 58. Bxe5 Nxe4 59. Bf4 Nxc3 60. Be6 $1 $18) (56.

Black gets his activity.} 59. Kf2 Qxe4 60. Bxe5+ Kc8 61. Qh3+ Kd8 62. Qh8+ Kd7
63. Qh3+ Kd8 {Carlsen is objective enough to understand that he has no
advantage now and accepts a draw. A moral victory for Vishy Anand as he was
completely losing after around 11 to 12 moves into the game! Great fight
displayed by Anand who didn't bow down to Magnus' excellent technique.} 1/2-1/2
