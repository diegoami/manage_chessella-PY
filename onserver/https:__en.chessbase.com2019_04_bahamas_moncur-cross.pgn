I decided to try to shake things up with the Dutch.} 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 g6 4. Nf3

GMs seem to prefer Nc5 here, though Stockfish is fine with my move.} 12. dxe6

Bxc3 Ne4 {Taking the bishop on c3 seems to minimize white's edge. Play now
revolves around my weak pawn on d6.} (19... Bxc3 20. Qxc3 Qg7 21. Qd2 Rf6 22.

22. Nd4 Rae8 23. Ne2 Rf6 24. Nc3 Nc5 {Trading knights was a little more
prudent, though at the time I felt I needed to keep more material on the board,
feeling that I'd probably lose the pawn on d6 and need to be able to mix
things up tactically.} 25. Rd4 $6 {It took me a while here to realize what was
wrong with this move. I had been dreaming of finding a way to play f4, and the
rook coming to d4 gives me tactical justification to go ahead with that plan.}

I can only think that white believed he must go after the pawn on f3 and he
missed the problem of his king and queen being lined up on the first rank 
(which would have been avoided if his queen was on d2 rather than d1).} (28.

line is simply inhuman, while my move crystalized everything for me.} (30...
