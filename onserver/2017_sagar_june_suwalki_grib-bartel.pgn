{[#] White has just pushed his pawn to h6. Black has many ways to draw the
game, he can bring his king near to e7, or go Rh3, or even give Rf1+. But
taking the pawn on f4 also looks fine, right? Well, that's what Bartel thought.
} Rxf4 $4 {I do not blame Bartel for this move. After defending for so many
moves, anyone can feel the tiredness and blunder.} (59... Ke7 $11) (59... Rh3
$11) (59... Rf1+ 60. Kxa2 Rh1 $11) 60. h7 Rh4 {So how exactly is White winning?
} 61. Ra6 $1 $18 {A very simple, yet not so easy to see move. The rook
threatens the simple move Ra8 and Black is simply lost. The king on d7 is
standing on the worst possible square. He is away from the white rook, as well
as the white pawn! Bartel resigned.} 1-0
