1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. Qe2 {the usual line
is of course e5, but Andreikin wants to switch things around.} Qe7 (6... d6 $5)
7. Nc3 Qe6 8. a3 a5 $6 {I don't quite understand this move. White really didn't
want to play a5 and Ba6 is not such a desirable move.} (8... Bc5 $11) 9. Bf4
Bc5 10. O-O-O O-O 11. Bxc7 {White sees a pawn, White takes a pawn. The position
retains double edged qualities but Black has to find compensation for the
material.} Re8 12. e5 $1 Ng4 13. Ne4 $1 Ba7 14. Kb1 {Black's pieces have almost
no movements. Taking on e5 leads to the variation considered under 14. h3 but
worse as White didn't waste a tempo. Kramnik tries to lash out, but it simply
does not work.} (14. h3 Nxe5 15. Nd6 Re7 (15... Qh6+ 16. Kb1 Re6 17. Nxc8 $18)
16. Kb1 $1 {And White's behind is close to decisive.}) 14... d5 15. exd6 $1
Qxe4 16. Qxe4 Rxe4 17. f3 $1 Nf2 18. fxe4 Nxd1 19. Ba6 {Very nice calculation
from Andreikin!} Bxa6 20. Rxd1 {White's down a piece, but he will get it back
with his passed pawn.} Bc5 21. a4 $1 {Fixing a5.} Be2 22. Rd2 Bf1 23. g3 f6 24.
d7 Be7 25. d8=Q+ Bxd8 26. Rxd8+ Rxd8 27. Bxd8 {It's possible that there is some
kind of miraculous draw here with the opposite colored bishops, but from a
human perspective it seems to be this is just lost, two pawns are too much.}
