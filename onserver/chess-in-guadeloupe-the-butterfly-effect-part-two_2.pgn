{An Alina classic: How would you continue with White?} 8. Bxf6 {Is what I chose
but it was clearly not the best} ({The first move that entered my head was} 8.
e4 $1 {It is perfectly within the spirit of the position so why didn't I play
it? Laziness. I thought I didn't need to calculate this if I had the slow and
safe alternative of Bxf6...} dxe4 9. Nxe4 Be7 10. Nxf6+ Bxf6 11. Bh6 b6 12. Be2
Bb7 13. O-O $16 {Black will never be allowed to castle, not in good
circumstances anyway.}) (8. Nb5 {was another good option} Be7 (8... a6 { is
only a storm in a teacup. The knight is taboo.} 9. Rc1 $18) 9. Bh6 Ng4 10. Bf4
O-O 11. Bc7 Qe8 12. Nd6 Bxd6 13. Bxd6 Ndf6 14. Qa3 {winning an exchange}) 8...
Qxf6 9. Nb5 Nb6 {and I was suddenly faced with a difficult decision: go back or
calculate my way through?} 10. Qb3 $6 {This was the last round in the
tournament, so maybe I can find a good excuse with lack of energy?!} (10. Nd6+
{would have still brought White an edge} Ke7 11. Qb4 {looks good but after} Kd8
$1 12. e3 {is what I missed} ({I calculated only the most aggressive
continuation, which doesn't work} 12. Ne5 Bxd6 13. Qxd6+ Bd7 14. e3 Qe7 $13)
12... Bxd6 13. Qxd6+ Bd7 14. Bd3 Qe7 15. Qf4 {and White still has the upper
hand.}) 10... Qd8 11. Rc1 Nc4 12. e3 a6 13. Nc3 b5 {Sad but true. The only one
that can be better is Black. Fortunately, I managed to emerge victorious...} *
