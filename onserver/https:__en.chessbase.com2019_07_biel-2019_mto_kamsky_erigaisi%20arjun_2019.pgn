brings his speciality to the board]} 15. b4 $5 {[The engine doesn't believe in
it, but the move is pure Kamsky: a pawn sacrifice for piece play on the
queenside, which may be a rarity in modern chess. One does see such ideas
during a kingside attack, but how does it work here?! The answer lies on the
black bishop at h7, which will remain a silent spectator through the game]}

{[Somewhere around here, black doesn't find the best way to play]} (24... Bg6 {
was a nice positional move, hoping to bring the bishop back into the game at
some point, either with a future ...Nf6-d7 & f7-f6, or from h5 if the
situation presents itself}) 25. Ndb3 Nfd7 26. Ra7 Nc5 27. Bd4 Ra6 28. Rc7 Nxb3

Rxb4 {[Black is still fine, but that is only if you employ engines to analyse
the position! Imagine black being under pressure for about 20 long moves
inching towards the time control: he finally cracks here]} Bxa5 36. Rxb8 {

doesn't look anything serious]} Bc3 37. Bxc3 Rxc3 38. Kf2 Rc7 39. g4 f6 40. Rd8
f5 $2 {[The proverbial 40th move howler - haven't you observed when most of
the 'lashing out' pawn advances almost always turn out to be positional
mistakes?! A typical 'freeing' push when your whole being screams for
'release' of tension]} ({Black could have still sat still with his hands under
his bottom, but not an easy thing to do over the board being under pressure]}
