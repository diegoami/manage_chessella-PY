interesting part of this game was the battle in the early middlegame between
White's desire to create a kingside attack and Black's to open hostilities on
the queenside. White got it wrong, ending up with no prospect of a serious
attack due to the black sqaure blockage and Jason was then able to cash in on
the queenside at his leisure.} 0-1

exactly what White wants.} 12. fxe5 Be7 13. h4 f6 {[#] The Greek gift with
Bxh7+ is surely the most common and well known stock sacrifice in chess but it
needs certain preconditions to work. It was discussed in detail in Vladimir
Vukovic's "The Art of Attack in Chess" first published (in English at least)
for Pegamon 1963 and still easily available. Annoyingly, I couldn't find my
copy on my shelves (though I'm pretty sure that it has a light brown cover)
but of course I do know the basis precepts. When you play Bxh7+ then
occasionally Black can ignore it with Kh8 because he has such strong threats
himself but ususally he'll want to capture and after Ng5+ must either hide on
h6 or g6 or retreat to g8. The attack needs at least one more piece apart from
the queen. If the king reats to g8 then instead of a knight on g5 this may
become a rook on h1 or a pawn on g6. While if the king has to advance to h6 or
g6 then or a black squared bishop on c1 or knight on c3 coming in quickly may
be crucuial. The sacrifice will often not work or at least be unclear if the
black king can run, as happens here.} 14. Bxh7+ $2 (14. Ng5 $1 fxg5 15. Qh5 {
