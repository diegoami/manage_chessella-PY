30... Bb8+ $1 {It seems that black´s attack is overwhelming.} 31. f4 {There
are no better moves.} Bxf4+ $4 {After the game Espen explained that he had
seen the variation with 31...Rxf4 and that it was leading to mate, but was so
excited that he made a "slip-of-the-brain" playing a´ tempo with five minutes
left on his clock.} (31... Rxf4 $3 {Just winning in all varations. But then
again; it´s so easy sitting at home commenting on this with a cup of coffee
and Stockfish.} 32. Nxf4 (32. Nxh4 Rf2+ 33. Kxh3 Rh2#) 32... Nxf4+ 33. Kg1
Qxg4+ 34. Qg3 Qxg3+ 35. Kh1 Qg2#) 32. Qxf4 Rxf4 33. Nxh4 Ng5 34. Kg3 Rxd4 {

it was a draw after 60 moves.} 1/2-1/2
