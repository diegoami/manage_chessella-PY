played much in this position so far.} (5... c5 6. Bg2 (6. dxc5 Qa5+ 7. Nbd2

normal.}) 6. Bg2 Qc8 7. h4 O-O 8. c4 c5 9. Nc3 Nc6 $2 10. d5 Ne5 11. Nxe5 dxe5
{White should be better here.} 12. Qd2 Rb8 {[#]} 13. a4 $6 {Black's idea is b5
alright, but I don't think a4-a5 effectively prevents this. With the centre
closed, it was also idea for White to delay castling/keep the king and rook's
role more flexible.} (13. Nd1 $142 Qc7 14. Rc1 a6 15. e4 {[%cal Gg2f3, Gh4h5]
was probably better, preparing against b5, which looks like Black's only
counterplay.}) 13... a6 14. O-O Ne8 15. a5 Nd6 {I don't think this approach
fights effectively against Black's counter-play in this position.} 16. Qc2 Qc7
{I think here Black has already enough counte-play which comes very fast.} 17.
