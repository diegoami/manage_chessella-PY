1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 {The point of this move is to get Black to put the
knight on f6 before playing d4. In this way White avoids some of Black's most
popular antidotes.} (3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 {and Black has three main options:} a6
(4... Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 {(Compare this position to the one that arises after 5...
Nc6 later.)} 6. Qd3 {is one of those awkward lines that are aimed at getting a
Maroczy setup, even at the price of playing some strange moves.} (6. Bxc6 Bxc6
7. Nc3 {, is similar to the game, but here Black can also play} h6 {,
intending e7-e5 and Nf6.}) 6... g6 7. O-O Bg7 8. c4 Nf6 9. Nc3 O-O 10. h3 a6
11. Bxc6 Bxc6 12. Nd4 {could be called a tabiya.}) (4... Nf6 {has become more
popular lately and White usually continues} 5. Bb5+ Bd7 6. c4 $5 (6. Bxd7+ Qxd7
7. c4 Nc6 8. Qd3 Qg4 9. Nc3 (9. O-O Qxe4 10. Qb3 Rb8 $2 (10... Ne5 $1 {and
White has little to show for having squandered the center.}) 11. Nc3 $36 {

2016.}) 6... g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. O-O O-O 9. Qd3 {with another typical Maroczy/
Bb5+-Sicilian.}) 5. c4 Nc6 6. Qe3 $5 {The
let's-put-the-queen-on-a-strange-square has gone so far that "strange" has
aquired a different meaning. If it works it is good and works it does.} g6 7.

R (2636) Cap d'Agde 2015}) 3... Nf6 ({After} 3... a6 $5 {White's only decent
way to avoid the Najdorf is} 4. g3 $5 {when Black can choose between a dragon
set-up and a more traditional Taimanov- or Najdorf-fianchetto.}) 4. d4 cxd4 5.
Qxd4 a6 ({White is hoping for} 5... Nc6 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. Bxc6 Bxc6 8. Bg5 e6 9.
O-O-O {which is a whole different ball game. Last I checked theory seemed to
agree that Black is all right here, but with the rise of the machines it is
quite possible that this verdict has changed.} Be7 10. Qd3 {[%cal Gf3d4]} Qa5
11. h4 {leads to a sharp game, but whether it is balanced I don't know.}) 6. e5
$1 {Otherwise Black gets a perfect Sicilian with Nc6 on the next move.} Nc6 7.
Qa4 dxe5 8. Nxe5 Bd7 9. Nxd7 Qxd7 {White has gained the bishop pair, but Black
has a harmonious position and develops fast. Intuitively I would not evaluate
this position as "better for White", as my silicon friend does, but the more I
look at it the more I feel that I perhaps should.} 10. Bd2 {A logical move
that paves the way for 0-0-0, but there is also something to be said for the
alternative, more positional way:} (10. Be3 {White is aiming to play g3, Bg2,
Rd1 and then take it from there. Black cannot sit idly by and wait, but needs
to find a way to put a stick into White's wheel.} e6 (10... g6 $6 11. Rd1 Qc7

on equality. Still, this line clearly shows that Black is under some pressure.}

attacked. After} e6 11. g3 Bb4 {White cannot play} 12. Bg2 $4 {due to} b5 13.
Qb3 Nd4 $1) 10... g6 {With white's king evacuating towards the queenside, it
is a good idea to aim the bishop towards b2.} 11. O-O-O Bg7 12. Bg5 {This is a
new move.} (12. Be3 Qc8 13. h3 $6 (13. g3 $5 {is more to the point, but I feel
Black should be fine here.}) 13... O-O 14. g4 {This arrangement is too slow
for White as it does not threaten the king while Black is not afraid to have
the knight kicked away from f6.} b5 15. Qb3 $6 Na5 (15... e6 $1 {[%csl Rb3]})
16. Qb4 {was unclear, in Blehm,P (2420)-Janssen,R (2345) Calicut 1998.}) 12...
Qg4 (12... Qf5 {is more ambitious. Perhaps Nakamura wanted to avoid Kramnik's
preparation, thinking "he probably thought I would keep the queens on, so I'll
swap them!". Maybe not.} 13. h4 (13. Bxf6 $2 Qxf6 {is absolutely horrendous
for White}) 13... O-O 14. f3 b5 15. Qf4 Qxf4+ 16. Bxf4 Rad8 {and with Black's
pieces are working very well together.}) 13. Bxf6 {From a general
which-piece-ought-to-be-swapped point of view, this move is a bit surprising,
but it soon becomes obvious that it is a good move.} Qxa4 14. Nxa4 ({Not} 14.
Bxg7 $2 Qf4+ 15. Kb1 Rg8 $19) 14... Bxf6 15. c3 $1 {This move restricts both
the knight and the bishop. Black has no equivalent move to neutralize White's
minor pieces and thus Black's queenside comes under pressure.} e6 {At some
point Black must take control of d5 and this is as good a time as any.} ({
The active} 15... b5 {doesn't solve Black's problems:} 16. Nc5 (16. Nb6 Ra7 17.

are other ways to get some advantage, the principled} 17. Nd7 {seems the
simplest. After} Rfe8 18. Nxf6+ exf6 19. g3 Ne5 20. h3 Rac8 21. Kb1 {Black's
knight is not quite at par with the bishop.}) (15... Rc8 16. g3 Rc7 17. Nb6 e6)
16. g3 Rc8 17. Bg2 Be7 18. Rd2 h5 $1 {Since there is no way to exchange ones
way out of the pressure, priority number one becomes to get some counterplay.}

terrific pressure on the queenside.}) 19. Rhd1 (19. h4 $2 {would reduce
White's winning chances significantly as the kingside pawns are set to be
chewed on by Black's bishop.}) 19... h4 20. Nb6 (20. g4 $2 Bg5) 20... Rc7 21.
Na8 {This kind of repetition saves time and also sends a message to the
opponent about who is in the drivers seat.} Rc8 22. Nb6 Rc7 (22... Rd8 23. b4
hxg3 24. hxg3 Rxd2 25. Rxd2 Rh2 26. Bxc6+ bxc6 27. a4 {, followed by Nc4, is
difficult for Black as both a6, c6 and - at some point - f7 are weak.}) 23. f4

awful for Black. Observe that} Rh2 $2 {fails due to} 28. Nb6 $1 {followed by
Bxc6+ and Rxh2.}) 25. Na8 $1 Rc8 26. Rd7 $1 {A wonderful concept built on the
strength of the unopposed bishop.} Rh2 (26... Rxa8 27. Rxb7 Rc8 (27... Nd8 28.

bishop.}) 27. Be4 $1 Re2 28. Bxc6 $2 {This move ruins it for Kramnik.} ({

Rh7 Bg7 {looks almost exactly like the game, with the exception of the
placement of Black's active rook. In the game it is on e2, but here it is on
e3. But how can this be better for White? Now the rook is not just active but
also threatening a pawn! However, what is most important is that the rook is
not just on a casual stroll, windowshopping for g-pawns, but on an important
mission to protect the e6-pawn. If the rook moves away White will strike with
Nxe6! So, White can continue with} 33. Kd2 $1 {and the rook ends up in a
pickle:} Re4 (33... Rxg3 $1 {might be the best still although} 34. Nxe6+ fxe6

to d3, the bishop will control if from d6. If the knight goes to e4, then the
