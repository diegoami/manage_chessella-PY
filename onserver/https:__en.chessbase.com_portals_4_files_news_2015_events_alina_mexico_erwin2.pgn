{The pawn structure was initially: White - g2, h3; Black - f7, g7, h6. Is this
winning?! I actually don't know. After what I saw in the game, I have doubts
and I tend to believe it is not. If you find the way, kindly share it with us!
Even in the very final moment, after a heroic defense, Black can still hold!} 
70... Rc4 {was played, missing the trick Erwin had been playing for but didn't
succeed to make it work, until now.} (70... Rc2 {Is just the right square, but
difficult to find, I believe.} 71. Kf5 Kf7 72. Bb4 Rf2+ {the point!} 73. Ke4
Re2+ 74. Kf3 Rc2 75. Rf8+ Ke6 {Even though the king was forced to get out for
some fresh air, it is not enough for White to create a breach in Black's
barricades.}) 71. Kf5 Ra4 ({If now} 71... Kf7 72. Bd6 {and Black cannot
prevent the mate on f8 anymore.}) 72. g5 $1 {Game over, nothing to be done
against the Kg6 unannounced appearance, and 2nd place for my husband. The
winner takes it all of course, but we don't have bad memories either:)} 1-0
