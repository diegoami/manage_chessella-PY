White gets a huge lead in development.}) 8. Be3 Bb7 9. f3 Be7 10. Rc1 d6 11.
Be2 Nbd7 12. O-O O-O 13. b4 {One of the main problems of this hedgehog setup
with Black is that White has had absolutely no problems in setting up his
pieces. He has developed them with ease and now threatens to connect his rooks
and later go Nb3 with the idea of c4-c5 or a4-a5. Hedgehog afficionados will
quickly realize that White has easier play than what he is supposed to have in
such structures.} Rac8 14. Qe1 Rfe8 15. Qf2 Qb8 16. Rfd1 Bd8 17. g4 $5 { This
looks like preparation by Mariya. The plan is surprising but not new. White
usually plays on the queenside, but g4-g5 helps White to increase his centre
control.} Ne5 18. g5 Nfd7 19. Na4 {The c4 pawn is defended and f4 is
threatened.} d5 $5 {Dzagnidze goes for the most natural break. After all flank
play must be answered by central play.} 20. cxd5 (20. c5 $5) 20... Rxc1 21.
