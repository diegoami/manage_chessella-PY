{[#]} {White has sacrificed a pawn, but he has serious threats on the kingside.
The Black king is not thrilled about this bishop sacrificing on g6.} 19. Bxg6

{Svidler takes the sensible decision to force the draw.} (20... Nc4 $3 { is
some kind of computer move that seems so unreal (what is the point even? Is Ne3

that it surely came to Svidler's mind, but it's almost impossible to play.})
