1. d4 Nf6 2. g3 {This is the second time the Chinese player uses this very rare
move order.} e6 (2... d5 3. Bg2 e6 4. Nf3 Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 (6. b3 c5 7. Bb2

similar idea to the game Berkes-Petrisor 2018.}) 6... dxc4 {
transposed back to Catalan in Ding,L (2804)-Giri,A (2780) Batumi 2018. Using
this move order, White avoided the quick 4...dc4 and also 4...Bb4+, which are
often played against the Catalan.}) 3. Bg2 c5 4. Nf3 cxd4 {And we get by
transposition (1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e3 3.g3 c5 4.Bg2 cd4) to a variation that was
used several times by Aronian.} 5. O-O (5. Nxd4 d5 6. O-O e5 7. Nb3 (7. Nf3 Nc6

Be6 8. Bg5 Nbd7 $1 $13 {was played by Caruana as White in internet blitz in
2017.}) 5... Qc7 {was seen in quite a few games, but it looks already like a
step in the wrong direction as Black will also need to lose time with a6 to
secure himself against Nb5 ideas.} (5... d5 {is normal, when White could play} 6.
Nxd4 {and transpose back to the game mentioned before.}) 6. Nxd4 a6 7. b3 {
The right approach planning to build a strong queenside pressure.} (7. c4 {
would transpose back to lines from 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 c5 4.Nf3.} Qxc4 8. Nc3
{White gets compensation but maybe not more.}) 7... d5 (7... Be7 8. c4 O-O 9.
Bb2 $14 {[%cal Gb1c3] gives White a very nice version of an English, though it
was preferable to what Black got in the game.}) 8. c4 $1 {White needs this to
prove his advantage in development.} dxc4 9. Bb2 cxb3 10. Qxb3 {also introducing
Rc1 ideas.} ({White could also consider} 10. Nd2 {with more than adequate
compensation. However, one does not want to allow the liquidation of queenside
when he has at least a similar alternative.}) 10... Nc6 $6 (10... Bc5 11. Nd2
O-O 12. Rac1 Qe7 {looks quite dubious for Black, but nothing terrible happened
yet.}) 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Bxf6 $1 {White gives up the pair of bishops, but he is
getting his pawn back while also damaging Black's kingside structure.} gxf6 13.
Qc3 Bd7 14. Qxf6 Rg8 15. Nc3 $16 {Even though Black has the pair of bishops, the
black king is rather weak, his pawn structure ruined and Bd7 looks at the
moment like an overgrown pawn.} Rg6 (15... Bg7 16. Qf3 {is not an
improvement for Black.}) 16. Qf3 (16. Qh4 {putting more pressure on Black's
kingside was definitely worth considering.} h6 (16... Rh6 17. Qc4 $16 {Rh6
looks a bit offside.}) 17. Rfd1 $16) 16... Be7 {seems like the right place for
the bishop.} (16... Bg7 17. Rad1 Kf8 18. Ne4 {now the knight can land on d6, creating havoc.})
17. Rac1 Kf8 {Finally Black's king is getting somewhere that resembles safety.} 18.
Ne4 Be8 19. Nc5 (19. Rfd1 $5) (19. Rc2 $5 {is a more flexible approach,
defending a2 in advance.}) 19... Qa5 20. Qe3 {following up on his idea. However,
as said before, White shouldn't necessarily allow the liquidation of his
queenside.} (20. Nd3 {was also a solid option, as now Black cannot really take
on a2, for example.} Qxa2 (20... Rd8 {is a more sensible approach.}) 21. Nf4 Rf6
22. Qh5 h6 23. Qe5 $18 {[%cal Gf4h5,Gg2e4] Rf6 is very awkward and Black will
lose material.}) 20... Qxa2 $1 {Now at least Black can hope for some suffering
in a drawish endgame} 21. Be4 Rg7 22. Rc2 ({White has no way to trap Black's queen.

Black managed to consolidate somehow and also snatched the a2 pawn in the
meantime. Still, White's pieces are now very active making Black's position
very dangerous.} 24. Qf3 (24. Nd3 {eyeing Black's queenside weaknesses was also a
solid option.} Qd6 (24... Rc8 25. Bxc6 Bxc6 26. Ne5 $16 Qd6) 25. Qb6 $16) 24...
Kg8 25. Rb7 Qd6 26. Bd3 Bd8 (26... Kh8 $1 {was important to find, in order to get out
of the potential tricks that annoyed Black in the game.} 27. Qe3 (27. Ne4 Qa3
$1 28. Qe3 f5 $132) 27... Bf8 {with chances to survive.}) 27. Ne4 {now
Caruana's position becomes critical.} Qe5 (27... Qa3 {is now impossible due to}
28. Nf6+) 28. Rc5 (28. Qe3 $5 {It was interesting to take the d4-square from the queen.})

Qf4 (31. Bc4 $1 {was, according to the engine, winning immediately.} Kh8 32. e3

on more resistance.} 32. Rc4 Qd5 33. Rxg7+ Kxg7 34. Nd6 Bg6 35. Rb4 $16 {
Although Black's position still looks like it could collapse anytime}) 32. Rb8

strong a4-pawn.} ({With} 36... Qg5 {Black could recover his piece but after} 37.

miraculously swaps the queens he would still lose most of the endgames.}) 37.

human would ever play.}) (37. Qf4 a3 38. Bc4 (38. Qc4 $2 {is surprinsingly just
a draw.} Qxc4 39. Bxc4 Kd6 40. Ba2 Kc5 $11 {Black's king is very fast.}) 38... Bb6 (

42... Qb4 {was another version of the endgame we saw in the game. As the pawn
on c6 is not getting very far, it should be an inferior version. However,
White cannot easily get to the a3-pawn while keeping f2 and e3 alive.}) 43. h3 (

sure in Black's favour. Since the white bishop needs to babysit the a3-pawn
constantly, I believe White's winning chances to be really doubtful.} 46. Bb1 h4

Caruana played just the same.}) 47. Ne2 f5 48. Nf4 Kf7 49. Ba2 Be7 50. Ke2 Bf6

simplest for Black was to continue his waiting strategy, as I cannot really
see how White will make progess.} 55. Kb3 Bc5 (55... f4 $2 56. exf4 Bxf4

his bishop.}) 56. Ng2 Be7) 55. Nf3 f4 (55... Kf7) 56. Nxh4 fxe3 57. fxe3 Kg5 58. Nf3+

more pawn on the kingside.} 59. Kd3 Bc5 60. Ke2 Kf6 61. Bb1 e5 $2 {The decisive
mistake. Now Black will lose one of his kingside pawns, which will prove fatal.
However, it's very hard to judge this active decision considering that Caruana
has been down to the last second starting from around move 40.} (61... Bd6 62.

h-pawn from getting too far.} (62... Kg7 63. h5 Kh6 64. Nd4 Kxh5 65. Nxe6 $18) (

promote the h-pawn, now it is easily winning.} Kg5 70. Bf7 $18 Kf4 71. Nc4 Bg7

to get his opponent under pressure from the first moves. After missing his
chance to end the game quickly, we got to a very complex endgame that looked
close to a draw only to be finally decided by a time-trouble blunder.} 1-0
