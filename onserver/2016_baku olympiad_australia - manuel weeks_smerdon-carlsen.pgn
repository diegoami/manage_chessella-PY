1. e4 c5 2. c3 {As the c3 Sicilian appeared I thought of when the only other
Australian played a reigning world champion. Ian Rogers had played Karpov and
I was trying to remember whether Ian had played his beloved Center Counter and
enjoying some appealing symmetry since David has been playing the c3 Sicilian
since day one in his chess career} d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 e6 6. Na3
Qd8 7. Nc4 Be7 8. Be3 {Unusual, the normal move is Bd3} (8. Bd3) 8... cxd4 9.
Qxd4 {Maybe this move is not the most ambitious of moves but when you are
playing the world champion being a little extra cautious, a little closer to a
"safe" postion can appeal. As we see later the real battle is yet to come.} O-O
10. O-O-O {Ok, this move starts to show that white might have ambitions after
all.} Nd5 {Now we have an opposite side castling game where it would be very
easy to go downhill fast but David knows he might have to go "all in" and he
has no problem with that.} 11. Qg4 {According to David, Magnus in the post
mortem said he understimated the dangers created by white after this move.}

across from the world champion, what move do you play?","","","c7c5","Diagram

calculating this as a spectator and I assumed Magnus was going to play Qa4.}
Qxg2 (16... Qa4 17. Bc2 (17. Nb2 Qxa2 18. Bc4 Qa3 19. Nb5 Qa6 20. Nc7 {with
some pain for black}) 17... Qxa2 18. Bb3 Qxg2 19. Rhg1 Qh3 {I envisioned this
with typical "vague" compensation but was quickly corrected after the game by
David, he has much better!}) 17. Rhg1 Qh3 18. Rg3 Qh4 $6 (18... Qh5 {This
seems to be better then the game continuation.}) 19. Qxh4 $1 {A slightly
unexpected decision to trade queens but now white has an advantage.} Bxh4 20.
Rh3 Bg5 {[%tqu "En","You are white versus the world champion, there is a
sequence of moves that leads to advantage but I am not sure any human being
would find and play them. Can you? If you can then you should also play board
one for your country!","","","d1g1","",10]} 21. Rg1 (21. Bxh7+ $1 Kh8 22. Bc2+

good square!} Be2 29. Ne5 $16 {Whether or not the game could have been won
from here we will never know but at least it seems that white is having all
the fun.}) 21... h6 22. Rxg5 {David now sees the forced draw and takes it but
there is nothing else at this point} hxg5 23. Bh7+ Kh8 24. Bd3+ Kg8 25. Bh7+
