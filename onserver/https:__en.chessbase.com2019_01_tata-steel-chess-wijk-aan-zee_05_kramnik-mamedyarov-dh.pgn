1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 {Mamedyarov reverts to
one of his favourite lines, the Open Spanish.} 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6
9. Nbd2 Nc5 10. c3 d4 {The old main line. This was debated for decades amongst
top players.} ({However} 10... Be7 {has taken over in popularity in recent
times and is the pet move of Mamedyarov himself.}) 11. Bxe6 Nxe6 12. cxd4 Ncxd4
13. a4 Bc5 $5 {A strange idea, as Black will have to lose another tempo with
this bishop. Black has many options in this position, and I guess that this
move was chosen mainly in the hope of surprising Kramnik. It is possible that
Mamedyarov based his preparation on the many correspondence games which have
reached this position.} ({I have tried out} 13... Bb4 {with mixed success}) ({
while} 13... Rb8 {and}) (13... Be7 {are also playable.}) 14. Ne4 Bb6 15. Nfg5 {
White attempts to remove the strong blockader on e6.} Qd5 $1 {Mamedyarov was
still blitzing out his moves.} 16. Nxe6 ({The calm yet mysterious} 16. Re1 {
is the engine's suggestion, although it is unclear why this is an improvement.}
) 16... Qxe6 (16... fxe6 $2 {would be a mistake as it exposes the black king:}
17. Qh5+ g6 18. Nf6+ Kf7 19. Qh4 $18 {[%csl Gf7] with an ongoing initiative.})
17. axb5 a5 {It is likely that this was still preparation.} (17... Nxb5 {
should be fine too, though} 18. Ng5 {would force Black to be accurate.}) 18. b4
a4 19. Be3 {Both sides have several options on every move. Unfortunately it is
impossible to cover all the variations.} ({While analysing the position, I
stumbled across one dramatic and fascinating line:} 19. Nc5 Qc4 $5 (19... Bxc5
20. bxc5 Nb3 21. Ra3 O-O 22. Be3 $14) 20. Rxa4 Rd8 21. Bg5 $1 {(willingly
allowing ...Ne2+)} f6 (21... Ne2+ $2 22. Kh1 Rxd1 23. Ra8+ Rd8 24. Rxd8#) 22.
exf6 Ne2+ 23. Qxe2+ Qxe2 24. fxg7 Rg8 25. Bxd8 {and despite the material
imbalance, play should end in a draw:} Rxg7 26. Bf6 Rxg2+ 27. Kxg2 Qg4+ 28. Kh1
Qf3+ 29. Kg1 Qg4+) 19... Qxe5 20. Nc3 Ne6 21. Bxb6 {The game now fizzles out.}
(21. Qd5 {is tempting, but also leads to nothing:} Qxd5 22. Nxd5 Bxe3 23. fxe3
O-O 24. Ne7+ Kh8 25. Nc6 $11 {it appears that this strong knight paralyses
Black's rooks, but in reality White's broken pawn structure means that he
cannot hope to win.} a3) 21... Qxc3 22. Bc5 Nxc5 23. bxc5 O-O 24. Rxa4 Qxc5 25.

{A well-played game by both sides.} 1/2-1/2
