1. c4 e5 2. g3 Nc6 3. Bg2 f5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. e3 e4 6. d3 Bb4 7. Nge2 d5 8. cxd5
Qxd5 9. dxe4 Qxd1+ 10. Kxd1 O-O {By this point I had barely spent four minutes,
while my opponent had already used more than half an hour. This was all my
preparation. It was pretty old and hence I had to recollect my lines during the
game.} 11. f4 $6 {This is a clear error. I had looked at it in my preparation
but could not remember on the board.} (11. exf5 Bxf5 12. e4 Bg6 $44 {This is
very good compensation. I can always play Bc5 and also ideas like Bf7-c4. Black
has many good ways to put pressure and White has to be very accurate to keep
the balance. So I was not worried about this at all.}) 11... fxe4 $6 { Perhaps
this was my only inaccurate move of the game.} (11... Rd8+ $1 {was an important
intermediate move.} 12. Kc2 Bxc3 $1 13. Nxc3 (13. bxc3 Nxe4 $15) 13... Nb4+
{Already the White king is feeling quite uncomfortable.} 14. Kb1 ( 14. Kb3 a5
$1 {and Be6 is coming up.}) 14... fxe4 {The e4 pawn cannot be taken because of
the pin down the h7-b1 diagonal and the knight will settle on d3 with a clearly
better position for Black.}) 12. a3 Rd8+ 13. Ke1 Bxc3+ 14. Nxc3 Bf5 {This
position I liked during the game. I had my pieces developed and he still has to
decide what to do with the bishop on c1.} 15. Bf1 (15. h3 h5 { After the game
we analyzed this position and Sam was of the opinion that inserting these two
moves h3 and h5 would be in his favour. But I was not so sure about it. I would
double the rooks down the d-file and I am not too worried about my position.}
(15... Na5 {Also Sam was afraid of this move.} 16. g4 Nb3 17. Rb1 Be6 18. Nxe4
Nxe4 19. Bxe4 Nc5 {Here my opponent felt that he was in trouble because Ba2 is
coming, but I think after} 20. Bc2 Ba2 21. Ke2 $1 {is a very strong exchange
sacrifice.} (21. Ra1 $6 Bb3 $1 $13) 21... Bxb1 22. Bxb1 $44 {The position is
changing in White's favour. I would prefer having the white pieces in this
position.})) 15... Be6 16. b4 {This was a really ambitious move.} (16. Bg2 {He
could have just repeated the position with Bg2 and I think I have nothing
better than bringing my bishop back to f5 with a draw. I did have an option to
continue with Na5, but it would have also led to equality.} Na5 17. Nxe4 Nb3
18. Rb1 {Now taking on e4 would lead to a variation which we examined above,
but instead Black can continue} Bf5 19. Nxf6+ gxf6 20. e4 Re8 21. Kf2 Bxe4 22.
Bxe4 Rxe4 23. Re1 {And the position is around equal. Nothing much is
happening.}) 16... a5 $1 {I liked this move.} 17. b5 {And here it was not so
easy for me to decide where to take my knight. Should I bring it to b8-d7 or
should I go for Ne7 instead?} Ne7 (17... Nb8 $5 {If the knight comes to c5 it
would really be strong. It looks at d3, b3 and is a complete monster.} 18. Bb2
Nbd7 19. Ne2 Nc5 (19... c5 $5 20. bxc6 bxc6 21. Nd4 Bd5 {I am not sure who is
better.}) 20. Nd4 {The position is interesting and I could have gone for this.
But I worried about disconnecting the rooks and hence chose Ne7 over Nb8.}) 18.
Bg2 (18. h3 {is a much better option.} Nf5 $5 (18... c6 $5)) 18... Bf5 19. Ra2
{This is really inviting me to come into the d3 square.} (19. Bf1 {I cannot
give up the a2-g8 diagonal, so most probably I would have repeated the position
with ...Be6. And I think for Sam, practically, this would have been the better
decision to accept the draw, because he was already down to 25 minutes, while I
had 50 minutes on my clock.}) 19... Rd3 20. Rc2 Rc8 $1 {This was an extremely
strong move. After the game when we analyzed he told me that he had missed this
idea of Rc8 with c6.} (20... c6 21. bxc6 Nxc6 {And now there is no rook on the
c-file.} 22. Bf1 $14) 21. Bf1 c6 $1 (21... c5 {Sam suggested this move to me
after the game. While this is strong, I had made up my mind to break with ...
c6.}) 22. Bxd3 {I did not like this move very much. It was much better to just
develop with Bd2.} (22. Bd2 cxb5 23. Bxd3 exd3 24. Rb2 Bd7 25. Nxb5 Nf5 { I
think I am quite comfortable and Nd6-Ne4 is coming up.} (25... Bxb5 26. Rxb5
Rc2 $44)) 22... exd3 23. Rb2 Ned5 {He missed this move. White has absolutely no
play and Black is clearly better.} 24. Nxd5 cxd5 25. Bd2 Ne4 26. Rg1 h5 27. Rg2
a4 {The computer does not approve of this move. But I thought Rb3-d3 is a very
natural idea for White and with this move I stop his plan. I took nearly 15
minutes for this plan.} 28. Rb4 Rc4 (28... Rc2 29. Rxe4 dxe4 30. Rf2 { I was
not sure how to break this fortress in the game. I knew that I could bring my
king and somehow breakthrough, but I was also not happy that my knight which
was so strong on e4 was gone. So I avoided this position. But of course, Bg4-e2
is just winning here.} Bg4 $1 31. Bb4 Be2 $19) 29. b6 Kf7 30. Rf2 g6 31. Rg2
Ke6 32. Rf2 Kf6 {This is no triangulation! Mainly I just wanted to reach the
time control and do something concrete after move 40.} 33. Rg2 Kf7 34. Rf2 Ke6
35. Rg2 Kd7 36. Rf2 Kc6 37. Rb1 Rc2 38. Rc1 Nxf2 {This opposite coloured bishop
endgame is winning and I had seen right until the very end.} 39. Kxf2 Kxb6 40.

{The h-pawn queens. I was quite happy with my level of play. I made no glaring
errors and overall it was a good game.} 0-1
