Be2 {After this move Black gets an advantage â€” his heavy pieces are menacing for White's king and the lost pawn is not relevant here.} (17. bxa6 {
was also playable but, in addition to the pressure exerted by his heavy pieces on the open files of the queenside, Black would probably capture the f3-pawn.} )(17. g5 $1 $11 {was probably the best.} )axb5 18. Nxb5 Qb6 19. Bxc5 Rxc5 {[#] Black has the advantage, but Dominguez finds a good move which limits the damage.} 20. c4 $1 Bxc4 21. Bxc4 Rxc4 22. Qxd7 Rb4 23.

was best. In this type of positions you should keep your queen, if at all possible: the white king would have been under massive pressure.} )24. Qxb5 Rxb5 25. Rhd1 {Dominguez has happily got rid of his problems.} g5 26. Rd8 Rb3 {[#] Dominguez is ready to advance his b-pawn no matter what. Was this a winning attempt?} 27. Kc2 (27.

Although Black is a pawn up, he has to deal with the threat of the white pieces invading his camp. Kulaots solves the difficulties confidently.} Rb8 35. b7 Kc6 36. Rc1+ Kxb7 37. Rf1 Kc6 38.
