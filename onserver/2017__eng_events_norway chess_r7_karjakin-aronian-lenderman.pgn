{I chose this game as the game of the day since it was not only a decisive
game but also a very high quality game by Levon who is in excellent form in this
tournament.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {These days the Italian game has
probably taken over in popularity over the Ruy Lopez, mostly because of the
Berlin and the Marshall.} Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 O-O 6. a4 a5 {The Aronian
speciality. Aronian has already played this move in several games, despite not being the most common move. According to my database
the most common move is the less committal 6...a6} (6... a6) (6... d6) (6... h6

Aronian without great opening success.} d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. Re1 Bg4 10. Nbd2 Nb6

Bg5 c6 $17 {And Black got an excellent opening even though in the end Black
lost the game.1-0 (41) Vachier Lagrave,M (2804)-Aronian,L (2785) London ENG
2016}) 7... h6 8. Bh4 Be7 9. Bg3 d6 10. h3 Kh8 $5 {This move is already a foray into
rare territory, and according to my database is a novelty. Aronian is
attempting to improve on his own play. Before, two times against the same
opponent, Fabiano Caruana, including in the prelimiarly blitz event before the
main tournament in Norway, Aronian played 10...Nd7!?} (10... Nd7 11. Nc3 {
White was a tiny bit better here but Black can probably hold this.} (11. Re1
Kh8 12. c3 Nb6 13. Bb3 f5 14. exf5 Bxf5 15. d4 (15. Na3 $5 {Might've been an
improvement for White.}) 15... e4 16. Nfd2 d5 17. f3 Bh4 $17 {was very good
for Black in... 1/2 (25) Caruana,F (2808)-Aronian,L (2793) Stavanger NOR 2017})

-Aronian,L (2774) Karlsruhe GER 2017}) 11. c3 Nh7 {This is the point of Kh8.
Now Black tries to play for the kingside initiative.} 12. Qb3 f5 $1 {According
to Playchess, Black spent 12 minutes here. This is a pawn sacrifice though.} (
12... Qe8 {Maybe Black also considered something like this but of course this
is an awkward move and a concession.} 13. Nbd2 $14) 13. exf5 Bf6 $5 (13...
Bxf5 {was also probably possible.} 14. Nbd2 (14. Qxb7 {This is a bit dangerous
for White.} Bd7 15. Bd5 (15. Qb3 Rxf3 $1 16. gxf3 Rb8 17. Qc2 Bxh3 18. Re1 Bh4

The principled move.} (14. Nbd2 $5 {was also possible.}) 14... Ne7 15. Nh4 Qe8 16.
Bxc8 Rxc8 17. Ng6+ Nxg6 18. fxg6 Qxg6 19. Qxb7 Ng5 $5 {Black continues to play
ambitiously, down a pawn for long-term compensation in view of piece activity
and initiative. It worked great in this game. Very brave play by Aronian!} (
19... Qxd3 20. Qb5 e4 (20... Qxb5 21. axb5 Ra8 22. Nd2 $16 {is of course not
great for Black since White simply has the better game without facing much counterplay.}
Rfb8 23. c4 Ng5 24. Ra2 $14 {And Black's pawn on a5 is weak as well as his
bishop on f6 can be a problem with all Black's pawns on the dark squares.}) 21.

Ne6 21. Qe4 Qh5 22. Nd2 Nf4 $1 {Of course Black has to play energetically here
to try to prove he has compensation for his pawn.} 23. Bxf4 exf4 24. Qf3 $6 {This
move seems to be the first inaccuracy by White since eventually the queen on
f3 might not be ideally placed and Black will take on h4 eventually anyway.} (
24. d4 $5 g5 $1 {Seems like Black's best reply.} (24... Bxh4 25. b4 $1 $14 {
The point of d4. Now White wants to create quick counterplay thanks to a
passed a-pawn and White seems to be doing well now.}) (24... Qxh4 25. Nf3 $16)
25. Rfe1 (25. hxg5 hxg5 26. Qd5 Kg7 $36 {is a bit dangerous for White.}) 25...

26. Nc4 (26. Rab1 g5 27. Qc6 g4 28. Qxc7 Be5 29. Rxe5 dxe5 30. Qxe5+ Kg8 {
is also very unclear and as such is unlikely to be an improvement for White.}) 26... g5 $1
{Now Black starts his initiative. Objectively the position is roughly equal but
probably Black is for choice here since he has the initiative.} 27. Re6 Bg7 28.
Rg6 $6 {Now this is probably already a serious practical inaccuracy since now
the e-file goes to Black and Black at the very least will have a serious
initiative if not already an advantage.} (28. Qh3 $11 {This was the simplest
route to clean equality.} Qxh3 29. gxh3 d5 30. Nxa5 Rxb2 31. d4 $11) (28. Rae1
g4 29. Qe4 f3 30. g3 Qh3 31. Ne3 Rxb2 32. Re8 {is also level.}) (28. Nxa5 $4 {
On the other hand is just a blunder because of} g4 29. Qd5 (29. Qe4 d5 30. Qxd5
g3 $19) 29... g3) 28... Rbe8 $1 29. d4 Kh7 $1 30. Qd3 Kg8 {After this nice
sequence of moves White is already in some trouble. However White's next move
doesn't make it easier for him.} 31. d5 $6 (31. Qf3 $1 {Here White should've
paused Black's initiative at least for now.} Kf7 32. Qd3 Qh5 33. Qf5+ Kg8 34.

bit better but White can still fight.} 39. Na3 f3 40. Rf1 $1 {And White is
still defending succesfully although Black is for choice.}) 31... f3 {This
move is good enough for an advantage and it's very difficult for White to play,
but I wanted to mention that Black seemed to have another interesting viable
alternative here.} (31... g4 $5 {would also be quite hard to meet.} 32. Rd1 $1
{Seems like practically the only move.} (32. g3 $2 Qh5 33. Re6 Rxe6 34. dxe6

really important for White to play Rd1.}) 32... Kh8 $3 {This move was very
hard to find though, and it Black would still be much better.} (
32... Qh5 {is less effective.} 33. Re6 g3 34. Qf3 gxf2+ 35. Kxf2) (32... Re7

long-lasting initiative against White's weak king.}) 32. gxf3 $6 {This makes
matters worse for White.} (32. g3 Qh3 33. Qf1 Qf5 34. Qb1 $2 (34. Re6 Qxd5 35.

this point Sergey was already in serious time pressure and this position is
very unpleasant to play. Sergey probably missed some of Levon's ideas.} (33.

speaking probably not for that long either.} Qh3 $1 {This is probably why
Sergey played Kg2.} 34. Qf1 Qh5 35. Re6 Rb8 $19 {And Black is winning but at
least White doesn't have to resign right away. He's not losing by force yet.})

when he played 31... f3} (33... g4 $2 34. Rxg4 Rxg4+ 35. fxg4 Qxg4+ 36. Kf1

resigned since After Kg6, the only way to stop a mating attack would be to
give up the queen. Brilliant game by Levon and now he's in prime position to
win such a super tournament!} 0-1
