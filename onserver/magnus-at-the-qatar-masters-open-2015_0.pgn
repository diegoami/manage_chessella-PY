Nbd7 {Magnus tries to play this in ambitious fashion, delaying 0-0 for quite
some time.} 9. O-O b5 10. h3 Bb7 11. g4 b4 {Black is in time to push the knight
from c3 before White could do something similar with g5.} 12. Nd5 Nxd5 13. exd5
O-O 14. Ng3 Re8 (14... g6 {was also possible.} 15. a3 a5 16. Be3 Bg5 { and we
can see that the move g6 has been much more useful than ...Re8}) 15. a3 $1 {A
very strong move by Brede Hagen which breaks up Black's queenside.} a5 16. Be3
Qc7 17. Qd2 Nb6 18. b3 {Preventing the knight from coming to c4. As can be seen
White does nothing spectacular, but calmly strengthens his position.} Bf8 19.
Rfd1 bxa3 20. Rxa3 {The a5 pawn is a huge weakness.} a4 21. Qb4 $1 Qxc2 {Magnus
decides to muddy the waters. Practically that is the best solution in this
given position.} 22. Rc1 Qb2 23. Rca1 Bxd5 24. Qxb6 Rab8 25. Qxb8 $5 (25. Qa5
Bxb3 26. Bd5 $16 {would have given White a clear advantage.}) 25... Rxb8 26.
Bxd5 $16 {Here too White is just better. He has two pieces and a rook for a
queen and three pawns. But the pieces are very well placed.} axb3 27. Ra7 Qc2
28. Rc1 $6 (28. Rxf7 $1 {with a deadly threat of discovered check would have
just ended the game.} b2 (28... Kh8 29. Rc1 $18) 29. Rb7+ $1 Kh8 30. Rxb8 $1
bxa1=Q+ 31. Kh2 (31. Kg2 $2 h6 32. Rxf8+ Kh7 33. Bg8+ Kg6 34. h4 Qa8+ $3 35.

35. Bxc2+ $18) 34. h4 $1 {The threat of h5 forces Black to give up his queens.
At this point if the king we on g2 then Qa8+ Rxa8 Qc6+ would have been possible
with an unclear position.}) 28... Qg6 29. Bxf7+ {After this move the game
peters out into a draw.} (29. Nf5 b2 30. Rb1 $14 {And White can still keep
trying.}) 29... Qxf7 30. Rxf7 Kxf7 31. Rb1 b2 32. Bd2 d5 33. Bc3 Rc8 34. Bxb2
Rb8 35. Rd1 Rxb2 36. Rxd5 Ke6 {A very well played game by Brede Hagen.} 1/2-1/2
