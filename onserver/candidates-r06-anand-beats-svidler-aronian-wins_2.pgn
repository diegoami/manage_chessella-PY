1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. h4 $5 {[%cal Gh2h4]} (3. Nc3 d5 4. h4 {is not so great
due to} c5 $1) 3... c5 (3... Bg7 4. Nc3 {is now a better version because Black
cannot play the d5 followed by c5 line.}) (3... d5 $6 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 $14)
4. d5 b5 {As Anish explained, the Benko is a very sound opening, it is just
that Black doesn't have the time in the opening to execute it well. But if
White wastes time with 3.h4 then the same Benko Gambit can be employed.} 5.
cxb5 a6 6. bxa6 Bg7 7. Nc3 O-O 8. e4 d6 9. Nf3 Qa5 {Anish had got the same
position against Adrien Demuth a few months ago but with the pawn on h4. He
managed to win that game. This explains why Anish was so positive about his
position. The move h4 doesn't make much sense here.} 10. Bd2 Bxa6 11. Qc2 Nbd7

Bxg2 14. Nd2 Bxh1 15. Bc3 Bh6 {gives Black some compensation, but maybe it is
not enough.}) 12... Qb6 13. Bc3 h5 $6 {A critical waste of time by Anish. He
could have snatched the initiative without worrying about the h-file.} (13...

16. Bxa6 Qxa6 17. Ne2 Nge5 18. Nxe5 Nxe5 19. O-O Qd3 {This position is a dream
for any Benko player, but objectively this should be around equal.} 20. Qxd3 (

33. Red2 Kf6 34. Kf2 Rb5 {Black is surely the one who is pressing, in spite of
being a pawn down, mainly because his pieces are more active and there are more
targets to attack.} (34... Rxh4 35. Nd4 Ra5 $17) 35. Rh1 Rxh4 36. Rxh4 Nxh4
{White's task has eased a bit, due to the exchange of a pair of rooks, but
there should still be some suffering.} 37. f4 Ng6 38. g3 h4 39. Rd3 hxg3+ 40.
Kxg3 Nf8 41. Kf3 Nd7 42. a4 Rb4 43. a5 Nf8 $1 {Anish really liked this move
transferring his knight to g6.} 44. Nd4 Ng6 45. a6 Ra4 46. Ne2 Rxa6 { And as is
typical in Benko, from being a pawn down, Black is now a pawn up.} 47. Nd4 Nf8

that Anish showed in the press conference went something like this} 51... Rh5

this one cannot be won.} Nc5 54. Kf3 e6 55. dxe6 Kxe6 56. Nc2 Kd5 57. Ne3+ Ke6
