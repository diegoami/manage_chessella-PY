{This was eye-candy for a chess player! I remember walking around the boards
when my eyes opened wider at the view of the following sequence of moves:}
19... c6 $1 20. f4 $1 {and just when my newest friend thought he's winning}
Bxc4 $1 {landed on the board; Now that looks pretty! Just like Keith, I felt
this should be winning for White and started thinking for a while but was
unable to sort things out as I had to get back onto my own chess business.
Thirty minutes later I looked again and the clock was still ticking for White..
.once later on in the room, I turned on playchess and checked out of curiosity
if and how should have Keith won. You can also give it a go if you wish:)} 21.
fxe5 {was played but led to nothing but a rather equal position for White.} ({
Obviously the only alternative is to grab the other hanging piece but what
would you play after} 21. bxc4 Ned3 {?} 22. Rxd3 {looks promising as well but
doesn't work} (22. Qe2 $1 {hits the jackpot! If you didn't find it don't worry,
I gave this position to some GMs friends of mine and they struggled too:)} Nxe1
23. Ne7+ Kf7 (23... Kh8 24. Ndxc6) 24. Rxe1 Re8 25. Ndf5 $1 gxf5 26. Qh5+ {
quite some calculation had to be done, all the way from the beginning. If you
place this in a sea full with other attractive alternatives it becomes less and
less clear which is the right route to victory. And that was the case in the
game as well.}) 22... Nxd3 23. Qxb7 {because of the sneaky} Rb8 $1 (23... Nxe1
{is losing immediately} 24. Ne7+ Kh8 25. Ne6 Rb8 26. Nxg6+ hxg6 27. Qg7#) 24.
Qxc6 Nxe1 25. Ne6 Qe8 {calculate and asses that if you can!}) 21... Bxd5 22.
Bxd5+ (22. exd6 {was more precise, liquidating into a rather equal endgame. We
know this is Keith's territory, so probably he would have found his way like a
fish in the water.} Qxd6 23. Nb5 Qf6 24. Bxd5+ cxd5 25. Qxf6 Rxf6 26. Rxd5 b6)
22... cxd5 23. e6 Qf6 24. Qg2 Ne4 25. Nb5 Rae8 26. Nc7 Qc3 27. Rxe4 dxe4 28.
Nxe8 Qe3+ 29. Kh1 Rf2 30. e7 Rxg2 31. Nf6+ Kg7 32. e8=Q Rg1+ {Once again, the
general level of chess knowledge increased and these days players with 2000
rating can find and apply real troubles on the board, which became so obvious
in Cardiff. Conclusion: the written rating can induce you into severe error,
especially in Wales.} 1/2-1/2
