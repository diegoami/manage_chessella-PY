novelty, the servers give 16 minutes here for Benjamin Bok here so it maybe
have been worked out over the board. It seems an unfortunate choice since
Vidit kept moving fast and seemingly still in his preparation.} 14. Nxb5 Qa5+

spectator I can only try and calculate a bit until I ask the all-powerful
Komodo what it thinks, “White is better” is the evaluation but I can see
all this piece activity for the black side and you wonder whether only a
computer would play this perfectly.} 18. Rg3 Be4 19. Bxc4 Rh5 {Black was worse
but this seems the losing move.} {[%tqu "En","There is more then one good move
here but still try and find the best. A small hint, it is not the most
obvious!","","","c4e6","",0,"d1g4","",10]} 20. Bxe6+ {Sometimes there is more
than one way to get a clear advantage, you see one good line and go for it
instead of spending valuable time on a possible brilliancy where there could
still be pitfalls to survive.} (20. Qg4 $3 Bxc3+ (20... Rh1+ 21. Ke2 Rxa1 22.

Can you see the beautiful idea?","","","e1f1","Gorgeous position, how many
times do you get to see something like this where one side (white) is
threatening Qxe6+, Qxh5, Qxe4, bxc3 and Bxe6+ all at the same time! Amazingly
there is no defence but to see this idea is tough to do when a good move is
already available to you!",10]} 21. Kf1 $1 {[%cal Gg4g6,Gg4e6,Gg4e4,Gg4h5,

high level preparation by the young Vidit.} Bxc3+ 22. bxc3 Qxc3+ 23. Kf1 Nf6 (

it a thankless task.}) 24. Rc1 Qe5 25. d7 Rd8 26. Rxh5+ gxh5 27. Bh3 c4 28.
