to collapse like a sandcastle. dxc6 seems the obvious answer but the activity
that gives to white pieces explains that even the possible exchange sacrifice
was more acceptable, for example:} (14... Nxe5 15. Nxe5 Rxe5 16. Bxa8 {Now
accepting the exchage sacrifice does not seem too strong as the compensation
of the pawn and the bad bishop of the white pieces is enough for the black.}
