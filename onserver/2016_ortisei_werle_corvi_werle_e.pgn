{Corvi had just moved his knight to the Kingside from c3 via e2, to g3 in
order to create - with the lethal combination Q+N - threats to the Black King.
With his following nice King's march he is bringing his King in safety, but
also uses it as an attacking piece.} 35. Kc3 $3 Bd5 36. Kb4 Rxb2+ 37. Kc5 Rc2+

hand for Black. His pieces are not coordinating at all, and his Rook on c3 is
helplessly cut off the board where the play is going on.} Rg6+ 42. Ke7 Rc1 43.
