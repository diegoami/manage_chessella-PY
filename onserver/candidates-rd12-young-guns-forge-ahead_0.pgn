{It was a complete debacle for Anand who was outprepared by Hikaru Nakamura.}
1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Nd5 $5 (5. Bg2 {Had been played by
Caruana against Anand.}) 5... e4 {Anand is trying to play sharp lines with
Black. Of course, he has every right to believe in his preparation but things
didn't work out today.} (5... Bc5 {is a safer way to play.}) 6. Nh4 O-O 7. Bg2

have given Nakamura and his team an idea that Vishy might go for this.} 8. O-O

new move in over the board games, although it has been played in correspondence
chess.} ({A logical question to ask is why shouldn't White win the e4 pawn?} 8.
Nxf6+ Qxf6 9. Bxe4 Re8 $1 10. Bg2 Bg4 $19 {With tons and tons of activity.})
8... Bc5 9. O-O Re8 10. e3 $1 {This is computer preparation in action. White
takes away the d4 square and gets ready to chase the bishop away with b4. At
the same time f3 is a real threat now. Normally one would play a move like d3
in such positions. But chess has become much more concrete thanks to the
engines and such anti-intuitive moves are no longer a rarity.} (10. d3 $6
{would be the more natural move but it is not so great.} exd3 11. exd3 Nxd5 12.

Nexd5 13. exd4 Nb6 14. d3 exd3 15. Qxd3 d5 $1 $11) 10... g5 {A logical question
to ask is why did Anand indulge in such complicated play when he knew that his
opponent was so well prepared? The answer to this is not easy. First of all you
want to respect the fact that your opponent is well prepared but you always
don't want to change the things you have prepared with the fear that he might
have something up his sleeve. Anand was confident and he went for his line.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - this is the story of modern opening
preparation!} (10... a5 {trying to stop b4 will now be met with} 11. f3 $1 exf3

later pointed out, this is the human reaction.} (11... gxh4 { would have been
the better option.} 12. Bb2 $5 Nxd5 13. cxd5 Ne5 14. bxc5 Bg4 { And Black is
doing much better than in the game because of the control of the f3 square.})
12. Bb2 $1 Nxd5 13. cxd5 Nd4 {Nakamura said that he had looked at the move Ne5
in his preparation and this came as a surprise. But Anand was already thinking
quite a bit and had found this over the board which meant that there could be
some flaw in it.} (13... Ne5 14. f4 $1 {This is a very strong move.} gxh4

position for Black. Rooks will double on the c-file and there would be
unbearable pressure.}) 15. dxe4 Ne6 16. dxe6 Rxe6 17. e5 $1 { Very incisive
play by Nakamura.} hxg3 18. hxg3 Qg5 19. exd6 Rxd6 20. Qb3 h5 ( 20... Rh6 {with
the idea of Bh3 was possible.} 21. Rfd1 Bh3 22. Qc3 f6 23. Bxh3 Rxh3 24. Qb3+
Kh8 25. Qe6 Rh6 26. Rd5 Qg6 27. Rad1 $18) 21. Rad1 Rh6 {Anand realises that
playing normal chess is anyway not going to get him anywhere, his position is
anyway lost. But with this ambitious idea of Rh6 followed by h4 he has made
Nakamura's task of finding the best move a little more difficult as one one
path exists.} 22. Rd5 Qe7 {At this point I was analyzing with Dusan Krunic
(chess informant) about how White should take advantage of these weakness. Qc3
looked like the most obvious way but after f6 with the idea of Be6 it seemed as
if Black was consolidating. We thought about many different moves, they were
good but not the best. Something was missing - what was the key to the
position? And then Nakamura made his move and we realized, yes! It was the h6
rook!} 23. Qc4 $1 {The idea is to play Qf4 and attack the rook on h6. A very
strong move.} Bg4 24. Qf4 Rg6 25. Re5 Qd6 26. Be4 {A crushing win for Nakamura.
It was for the second time in this tournament that Anand resigned with equal
material on the board. First one was against Sergey in round four.} (26. Bxb7
