1. d4 {Peter's student Vincent Keymer is a 1.d4 player, so is this a case of the
coach learning from the student?} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 0-0 8. e3 Bf5 9. Be2 Nbd7 10. Qb3 Bxc3+ 11. Qxc3 Ne4 12. Bxd8 Nxc3 13. bxc3 Rfxd8 {This position is perhaps what Leko was aiming for
from the start. I feel White has some potential on the queenside with the open
b-file and the possiblity of pushing the a-pawn as far as it can go.} 14. a4 (14. c4 $5 {was a more accurate move order. The position is essentially equal,
so Black is fine after} dxc4 15. Bxc4 c5 16. Ke2 Nb6 17. Rhc1 Rdc8 18. Bd3 Bxd3+ 19. Kxd3 Na4 {But White should have something after} 20. Rab1 )c5 15. a5 Rac8 16. Nd2 cxd4 17. cxd4 Rc2 18. g4 Bh7 19. Bb5 $6 (19. h4 $5 {
was a tad more precise, though Black gets supermacy of the c-file after} Rdc8 {
and claim a tiny advantage.} )Nf6 20. f3 Rb2 21. Ba4 Bd3 22. h4 Rc8 23. Rh2 Ba6 (23... Ne8 $1 {was the only way to continue to pressurise White on the
queenside.} )24. Nf1 Rxh2 25. Nxh2 Rc3 {The computers sometimes overevaluate
the control of an open file. This was the case earlier in the game. Only now
do they begin to appreciate White's expansion on the kingside.} 26. Kf2 Kf8 27. Rb1 Ra3 28. Bb5 Rxa5 29. Bxa6 bxa6 30. Rb7 Ra2+ 31. Kg3 g5 32. hxg5 hxg5 33. Rxa7 a5 34. Nf1 Kg7 $2 {This natural move is the start of Black's problems.} (34... Ne8 $1 35. Ra8 Ke7 {was the best defense. Perhaps Vidit was afraid of} 36. Ra7+ Ke6 37. e4 {but after} dxe4 38. fxe4 Ra3+ 39. Kg2 Nf6 $1 $11 {White
gets compensation for the pawn he will soon lose, but nothing more.} )35. Kh3 Ng8 $2 (35... Ne8 $1 {was Black's best defensive try in this position. The
knight looks at c4 from d6 and keeps an eye on the f5 square, so that the
White knight can't invade without some concessions. White remains slightly
better after} 36. Ng3 Nd6 37. Rd7 {but Black holds on for now after} Nc4 38. Rxd5 Kg6 $1 $14 )36. Ng3 Nh6 $6 {Shortage of time? Vidit's faulty defensive
arrangement is not too hard to refute. The knight is horribly passive on h6.
It would have done much better in the center.} 37. f4 $1 $18 {Leko doesn't let
go from here.} gxf4 38. exf4 Ra3 39. Kh4 Kg6 40. f5+ Kh7 41. g5 {The problem
for Black here is that his rook is out of play on the queenside, and all his
kingside pieces are defenceless against White's incoming wave of attack.} Rxg3 $5 {The best practical chance.} 42. Kxg3 Nxf5+ 43. Kg4 Nxd4 {Black eliminates
one of the two remaining pawns, but he never gets close to the final white
pawn, which decides the game.} 44. Rxf7+ Kg6 45. Rf6+ Kg7 46. Ra6 Nc2 47. Kh5 d4 48. Ra7+ Kg8 49. Rxa5 $6 {One of the few innacuracies from Leko.} (49. Kg6 $1 Kf8 50. Kf6 Ke8 51. g6 $1 {forces mate.} )Ne3 50. Ra8+ Kg7 51. Ra7+ Kf8 52. Rd7 Nf5 53. Kg6 Ne7+ 54. Kf6 Ng8+ 55. Ke6 d3 56. Rxd3 Kg7 57. Kf5 Ne7+ 58. Kg4 Ng6 59. Rd7+ Kg8 60. Ra7 Ne5+ 61. Kf5 Nf7 62. Kf6 Nd6 63. Ra8+ {
and Vidit resigned, as it is mate in 3. A wonderful technical display from
Peter Leko!} 1-0
