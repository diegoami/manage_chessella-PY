1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 h6 7. a4 a5 {The
players are following the game Carlsen-Adams from Wijk Aan Zee 2016. Here
Carlsen went Na3 but Caruana first inserts Re1.} 8. Re1 O-O 9. Na3 Re8 10. Nc2
Ba7 11. Be3 Be6 12. Bb5 Bd7 13. Bxa7 Nxa7 14. Bc4 Nc8 {Caruana thought that
this manoeuvre was a little odd, but according to Topalov Black should be
completely fine here.} 15. Ne3 Nb6 16. Bb3 c6 17. h3 Be6 18. Bc2 Qc7 19. d4 {
White has a slight more pleasant position.} Nc4 20. Nxc4 Bxc4 21. Qd2 Rad8 22.
Rad1 Be6 23. Qe3 b6 24. Nd2 c5 25. Bd3 Re7 $6 {This doesn't seem to be a very
useful move. Emil Sutovsky was very critical about it in his facebook post:
"Topalov didn't have much of a problem out of the opening, but he simply
stunned me by making a move Re8-e7 in a very complex position literally within
a few seconds. The position required quite some thought, and it could have been
a critical point"} 26. d5 Bd7 27. Ra1 {The idea of Ra1 followed by b4 is very
interesting.} Nh5 28. b4 Nf4 {The knight is well placed on f4 but later on it
becomes the sole reason why Black's position goes downhill. It comes in the way
of other pieces.} 29. bxa5 bxa5 30. Reb1 Rf8 31. Bb5 Bc8 32. Bf1 f5 { It is an
interesting position with White playing on the queenside and Black on the other
wing. But soon Topalov goes wrong.} 33. c4 Ref7 34. Ra3 fxe4 35. Nxe4 Bf5 36.
Rab3 {As previously pointed out the knight on f4 really stops Black from
getting his required counterplay.} Bg6 37. Rb6 Qe7 $2 (37... Bxe4 { was
necessary and although White is clearly better, Black doesn't lose material.
Instead Topalov hallucinated and committed a blunder.}) 38. Nxd6 { White has
simply won material and stands just better.} Nxh3+ 39. Qxh3 {True the rook on
b1 is hanging but so is the guy on f7. So it just a complete piece up
position.} Rf6 40. Nc8 $1 Qd8 {[#]} 41. R1b5 $2 {An error on the 41st move.
Very surprising.} (41. Rxf6 Qxf6 42. Rb2 {is just curtains. White is a piece up
and there is nothing more to play for as} Bf5 {fails to} 43. Qxf5 $18 { [%csl
Rf5,Rg8][%cal Rc8e7]}) 41... Rxf2 {Now it gets a little complicated.} 42. Rxg6
Rxf1+ 43. Kh2 Qxc8 44. Qxc8 (44. Qxh6 {would have still given White excellent
winning chances.}) 44... Rxc8 45. Rc6 (45. Rb7 Rf7 46. Rc6 $5 { was an option.
But it is not enough to win because after} Rxb7 47. Rxc8+ Kf7 48. Rxc5 Rb4 $11
{it is just equal.}) 45... Re8 {The two black rooks combined with the e-pawn
give Black enough counterplay to hold a draw.} 46. Rcxc5 e4 47. d6 Rd8 48. Rc6
Rd1 49. c5 e3 50. Rb2 Rd2 51. Rb1 e2 52. Re1 Rf8 {Quite a heartbreak for
Caruana who could have been on 2.5/4 with this win.} 1/2-1/2
