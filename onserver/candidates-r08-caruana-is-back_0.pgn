{No one could have imagined that this game transpired from an Anti-Berlin.
It looked more like the sharpest line of the Sicilian.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3
Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 Bc5 5. Bxc6 {In his game against Anand, Hikaru said
that he was happy to get his knight to d4. Well, if that was the case
then Caruana didn't want that knight to exist.} dxc6 6. Nbd2 O-O 7. Qe2
{Anand is the main founder of this move, having played it against Giri
and Kryvoruchko.} Re8 8. Nc4 Nd7 9. Bd2 Bd6 10. O-O-O {We have been following
Perez Candela-Sargissian. There the Black player played c5, but Nakamura
went for the queenside expansion with b5.} b5 11. Ne3 a5 12. Nf5 a4 13.
Bg5 f6 {Provoking f6 so that the g-pawn has a hook to open up the kingside.}
(13... Nf6 {doesn't look so great. The pin is irritating and the g-pawn
anyway comes down the board.} 14. g4 h6 15. Bh4 $40) 14. Be3 Nc5 15. g4
Be6 16. Kb1 b4 {It seems as if the black forces are going to reach White's
gates faster, but because Caruana hasn't moved any of his kingside pawns
this might not be so easy to break for Nakamura. In fact after the game
Hikaru said that his plan of b5-b4 looked like bad judgement.} 17. g5
b3 $6 {Unbelievably this natural move turns out to be an error.} (17...
Bxf5 18. exf5 a3 19. b3 e4 $13 {is the direction in which Nakamura should
have been looking.}) (17... Kh8 $5 {Tucking the king in the corner too
looks like a logical choice.} 18. Rhg1 Bxf5 19. exf5 a3 20. b3 e4 21.
Nd4 (21. Bxc5 exf3 $19 ) 21... fxg5 22. Bxg5 Qd7 $15) 18. Rhg1 $1 {[%cal
Gh1g1] A fantastic move by Caruana. He had studied similar postions before
and had come to the conclusion that it makes sense not to touch any pawns
on the kingside.} bxa2+ (18... bxc2+ 19. Qxc2 $16) 19. Ka1 Bxf5 20. exf5
a3 (20... Kh8 21. Nh4 $40) 21. b3 {Black is already in trouble. Nakamura
had planned e4 here, but it doesn't seem to work.} Na6 {This seemed like
the only way to continue the game. But even then White has a huge edge.}
(21... e4 $2 22. dxe4 Rxe4 23. Rd4 $1 Rxd4 24. Bxd4 $18 ) 22. c3 {This
maintains the advantage and is pretty strong. Caruana found it after 30
mins of thought.} (22. d4 $1 {would have been stronger as after} exd4

is completely lost.} e4 (25... Nxd3 26. Ne4 $18) (25... Qxd3 26. Qxd3
