{Going into the game Magnus was definitely to win this battle considering the
limited experience Harikrishna has at super-elite tournaments and also because
the World Champion had the white pieces.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 { Hari
doesn't go for the QGD with 3...d5, and instead opts for the Queen's Indian
Variation.} 4. g3 Ba6 5. Nbd2 {This is known to be a pretty unambitious line.
Mainly because the knight is not so well placed on d2. Of course it would like
to go to c3. But the problem that White faces after the move Ba6 is that any
and every move that he plays to defend the c4 pawn has some drawback. If he
goes b3, the dark squares are weakened a bit and Black can take advantage of it
by Bb4+. If Qc2 or Qa4 is played then the control on d5 is lost and hence after
c5, d5 becomes a gambit. Tough Nbd2 is not dangerous for Black, whatever Magnus
plays could be the start of a new direction in theory.} Bb4 {Threatening to win

clear advantage.} h6 20. Qe3 $1 {Why would a normal person be ready to accept a
sickly looking isolated pawn on e3. And that too voluntarily in a position
where there are other better moves? Well, the secret to this lies in the fact
that Magnus is very well acquainted with the Classics. Most probably he drew
this idea from the game Botvinnik versus Boleslavsky.} Qb7 {Hari prefers to
keep the queens but now he just much worse.} (20... Qxe3 21. fxe3 {It is true
that the e3 pawn is weak but now White has much greater control on the d4
square and it is not so easy to take advantage of the e3 weakness. Meanwhile d5

the c1 bishop.} O-O 5. Bd3 c5 6. Nf3 d5 {This is the tabiya of the entire
