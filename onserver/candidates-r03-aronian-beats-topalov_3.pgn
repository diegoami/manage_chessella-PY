1. d4 {Nakamura invites Svidler to play his favourite Grunfeld.} d5 {No thank
you! I will stick to the Slav.} 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. a4 e6 {
Svidler shows that the opening that he essayed in the first round against
Karjakin was not just a one round flick. He was serious about his opening and
has prepared it deeply.} 6. e3 c5 7. Bxc4 Nc6 8. O-O cxd4 9. exd4 {This is
definitely much more challenging than Nxd4 which was played by Sergey Karjakin
in the first round.} Be7 10. Qe2 O-O 11. Rd1 Nb4 {Preventing the d4-d5 break.}
12. Bg5 {Interestingly Svidler reached this position twice in his games, once
against Ivanchuk and once against Kazhgalayev. However, on both occasions he
chose a different move. h6 is the modern treatment of this line making White
decide where he would like to keep his bishop.} h6 13. Bxf6 {This is a highly
concrete move. The idea is not related with the d5 break but to get the knights
to menacing locations in the centre - on the e4 and e5 squares.} (13. Bh4 Bd7
14. Ne5 Bc6 {is the other critical position of the opening, and if Svidler
tries this Slav line again the chances of this position arising can be quite
good.}) 13... Bxf6 14. Ne4 (14. d5 {doesn't really look too threatening as
after} exd5 15. Nxd5 Nxd5 16. Bxd5 Qe8 $11 {Black has solved most of his
opening problems because the b2 pawn is as weak as the b7 pawn.}) 14... b6 15.
Ne5 {We are still following five games, but we have reached a stage where you
can no longer find games played by amateurs. All the games have taken place in
the practice of 2600+ players.} Bh4 $5 {This has already been played by two
players Mchedlishvili against Tomashevsky and van Foreest against Ikonnikov.} (
15... Bb7 $2 16. Nxf6+ Qxf6 (16... gxf6 17. Ng4 Kg7 18. Qd2 $18) 17. Nd7 $16)
16. g3 $146 (16. Ra3 {was played in both the games but after} Bb7 17. Rh3 { It
looks scary but after} Nd5 $11 {According to the computer this looks completely
fine for Black.}) 16... Be7 17. Nc3 Bf6 {Svidler has got this covered. Even
though White played a novelty, the Russian player is well prepared.} (17... Bb7
$6 {Looks the most natural but fails to} 18. Nxf7 $5 Rxf7 19. Qxe6 Qe8 20. Re1
$40 {with a most probably decisive attack for White.}) 18. d5 Qc7 19. d6 Qc5
20. Ng4 Bxc3 21. bxc3 Nc6 22. Rab1 a6 {Preventing Rb5. It is simply amazing
that this is all Svidler's preparation until now.} 23. d7 { It seems like
Nakamura missed something over here. He couldn't remember his preparation and
played the most obvious move, pushing his pawn to d7. However, he could have
just played Bd3 directly which is what he thought was the move he had
prepared.} (23. Bd3 f5 $5 24. Ne3 $13) 23... Bb7 24. Bd3 Rfd8 25. Qe4 Kf8 {[#]
At this point Peter had one hour forty five minutes! Completely mind boggling!
Will it create a fear in the minds of his future opponents? Will they try to
steer clear of well-known lines against him? We will have to wait and see. As
of now Nakamura was under grave pressure.} 26. Qh7 {This position looks really
scary if you are unprepared. However, if you know the intricacies this might
well be enjoyable to play, like the current position where Black has only one
good move but Peter plays it! As Svidler said after the game he had considered
only two moves in this position Be2 and Bc2. So Qh7 was a new move for him, and
he found himself in a common situation where you know that the move made by
your opponent is not the best, but you don't know why.} h5 $1 (26... Qg5 $2 27.
Ne3 Ne5 28. Be4 Bxe4 29. Qxe4 $18 {The d7 pawn is untouchable and the queen is
completely misplaced on g5.}) (26... Ne5 $5 27. Qh8+ Ke7 28. Qxg7 Qd5 29. Qf6+
Kf8 30. Qh8+ {is a draw.}) 27. Ne3 (27. Qh8+ Ke7 28. Qxg7 hxg4 29. Qxg4 $19)
27... Ne5 $1 $15 {Black's king looks safe, and the pawn on d7 doesn't look
threatening. The light squared holes on the kingside might cost White dearly.}
28. Be4 {Before things went completely wrong Nakamura exchanges the powerful b7
bishop.} Bxe4 29. Qxe4 Ra7 $1 {Svidler also made this move relatively quickly.
Not sure whether he was still in his preparation but he must have seen similar
ideas when he worked on this opening and that can be one of the reasons why he
made this move quickly.} 30. Nd5 $5 { Nakamura is in damage control mode now.
He sees that the position has spiraled out of control. Hence he tries to
simplify the position, even ready to go into a pawn down or an inferior rook
ending.} Ng4 (30... Raxd7 {looks pretty natural, but after} 31. Qxe5 Rxd5 32.
Rxd5 Rxd5 (32... Qxd5 33. Qxd5 Rxd5 34. Rxb6 $11) 33. Qb8+ Ke7 34. Rxb6 (34.
Qxb6 $2 Rd1+ 35. Kg2 Qd5+ 36. f3 (36. Kh3 Qf5+ $19 {[%cal Gf5b1]}) 36... Rd2+
37. Kg1 Qa2 $19) 34... Rd1+ 35. Kg2 Qd5+ 36. Kh3 {and there is no real
finishing shot available for Black at this point. This might be the reason why
Svidler steered clear of this variation.}) 31. Ne3 Nf6 (31... Nxe3 32. Qxe3
Raxd7 33. Rxd7 Rxd7 34. Qxc5+ bxc5 35. Rb6 $15 { With a three vs four rook
endgame being reached.}) 32. Qb4 Qxb4 (32... Raxd7 33. Rxd7 Nxd7 34. Qxc5+ Nxc5
35. Rxb6 Nxa4 36. Rxa6 Nxc3 {would also lead to something similar that we will
see in the main game.}) 33. Rxb4 (33. cxb4 Rdxd7 {is just a pawn down
position.}) 33... Nxd7 $5 {Such a move can be made by only very strong player.}
(33... Raxd7 34. Rxd7 Nxd7 35. Nc4 Rb8 {might be very favourable for Black who
is not only a pawn up but also has everything under control.}) 34. Rxb6 Nxb6
35. Rxd8+ Ke7 36. Rd4 a5 $1 {Svidler instead of winning a pawn wanted to reach
this endgame, which shows his excellent feel for the game. He thought that here
with his pieces co-ordinated, he has much better chances of converting the
position.} 37. Nc4 $1 {This move was not really given importance by Peter. If
Black could have played his rook to c7 before Nc4 then he was winning. But in
that case it will end in a position with 4 vs 3 on the same side.} Nd5 38. Rd3
Rc7 39. Nxa5 Nxc3 40. Kg2 Nxa4 41. Ra3 Nc3 42. Nb3 g5 {Black has an extra pawn
and more space on the kingside. With just the rooks it would have been drawn,
but with the knights things look pretty good for Black. In any case Nakamura
has a very tough defensive task ahead of him.} 43. Nd2 f5 44. h3 Kf6 45. g4 $5
{As always it is a decision of whether to do something in the position of just
sit steady. Nakamura felt that he had to do something against the slow advance
of Black's forces and hence goes for this move. It might well be that the
position is lost after this but White also has some targets to attack.} Nd5 46.
gxf5 Kxf5 47. Nf1 $1 {Nakamura sees that e3 will be the best spot for his
knight.} Nf4+ 48. Kg3 Rc1 49. Ne3+ Kg6 50. Kh2 Rb1 51. Ng2 Rb2 (51... Ne2
{Maybe Svidler could have considered keeping the knights on the board.} 52. Re3
Nd4 $17) 52. Nxf4+ gxf4 {This endgame looks much more drawish than with the
knights on the board. Let's have a look if that is the case.} 53. Kg1 (53. Kg2
{looked as if it was not accurate because White would like to meet e5 with f3.
But maybe that is not very important as after} e5 54. Ra6+ Kf5 55. Rh6 $1 Kg5
56. Re6 $11) 53... e5 54. Ra5 (54. f3 h4 {Nakamura and Svidler thought this was
a winning position for Black, but turns out that this will also be a draw.} 55.
Ra5 Kf5 56. Ra6 $1 {Cutting the king off from e6 and preventing its entry.}
(56. Rc5 Ke6 57. Rc6+ Kd5 58. Rh6 Kd4 59. Rh5 e4 60. fxe4 Ke3 $19)) 54... Re2
55. h4 f3 56. Kh2 $1 Rxf2+ 57. Kg3 Re2 58. Kxf3 {With excellent play Nakamura
finally could heave a sigh of relief. He had successfully made it to a draw.}
