cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The Najdorf is Kulaot's favourite opening and one
where he has a lot of experience.} 6. Nb3 {This is a line popularized by
Polish GM Mateusz Bartel at the Aeroflot Open itself in 2016.} g6 {Kulaots
figures out that the Dragon would be a good setup considering that White has
spent time on moving his knight on d4 without provocation.} 7. Be2 Bg7 8. g4 {
Parham always takes the fight to his opponent and doesn't shy away from a
fight here as well.} h6 9. Be3 Nbd7 10. f3 Qc7 11. Qd2 b5 12. a3 Rb8 13. O-O-O
{White has parked his king on the queenside. Where should Black keep his king?
0-0 is not an option because Bxh6 loses a pawn. Hence, it is important to keep
the king in the centre and start launching a queenside attack.} Nb6 14. Bd4 e5
{This move does weaken the square on d5, the pawn on d6 and also closes the
bishop on g7. Doesn't really look like a great move, but at the same time it
is quite concrete in nature.} 15. Bxb6 (15. Be3 Nc4 16. Bxc4 bxc4 {gives Black
a good position tactically.}) 15... Rxb6 16. h4 {The threat is to play g5,
push the knight and plonk the white knight on d5.} Be6 17. Kb1 O-O {After
White gave up his dark squared bishop, one of the advantages for Black is that
his king on g8 is never going to get mated.} 18. Nd5 Nxd5 19. exd5 Bd7 20. h5
g5 21. Bd3 {There is a chapter in Jacob Aagaard's book Strategic play which is
named fighting the tide. What it essentially meant is that there are positions
where things are not going your way. In such positions rather than sitting
tight and doing nothing about it, what you should be doing is fighting the
tide. Fighting back!} e4 $1 {[%cal Ge5e4] Objectively maybe not the best move.
But it is fighting the tide. It is saying to White - "Look I know I am worse,
but I am not going to go down quietly. I am going to create threats and see
how you defend against them!"} 22. Bxe4 b4 $1 23. a4 $5 (23. axb4 Qc4 {is what
must have made Parham not take on b4, but after} 24. Na5 Qxb4 25. Qxb4 Rxb4 26.
b3 Bxg4 27. Nc4 $16 {This does look like a pleasant endgame for White.}) 23...
Bxa4 24. Nd4 b3 25. cxb3 $2 {This is just a bad decision.} (25. c3 $14 {
was much better when Whiet can be worried about the black queen coming to a2
in the future, but that is not really happening. At the same time the knight
moving to c6 will cause quite some discomfort for Black.}) 25... Bxb3 26. Rc1
Qb7 {[%cal Gg7b2,Gb6b2,Gb7b2] The bishop on g7 and the major pieces down the
b-file make b2 a very soft target.} 27. Rh2 Rb8 (27... Bxd5 $1 $19) 28. Rc6 Rb4
29. Nxb3 Rxb3 30. Rc2 a5 (30... Bxb2 31. Rxb2 Rxb2+ 32. Qxb2 Qc7 $19) 31. Kc1
Be5 $1 {The rook on h2 is hanging and Bf4 is also threatened.} 32. Kd1 Bxh2 33.
Qxh2 Qb6 (33... Rxb2 $19) 34. Kc1 Qe3+ 35. Kb1 Qe1+ 36. Ka2 Ra3+ $1 {A very
nice finish.} (36... Ra3+ 37. bxa3 (37. Kxa3 Qa1#) 37... Qb1#) 0-1
