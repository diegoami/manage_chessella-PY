29 It seems as if White's entire opening strategy has failed. Black has got
the b5 break and there is absolutely no way for White to defend his c4 pawn.
But who needs the c4 pawn?} 12. Ne3 $1 {865 It seems to me that this is all
Nihal's preparation and to get his opponent into something that he had
prepared, he was taking a lot of time!} bxc4 {529} 13. Ned5 {214 White says to
Black that look you have been playing on the queenside and your knight is not
so well place, I am going to give up material!} Nf6 {1178 This looks like the
best move. It was played after nearly 20 minutes!} (13... cxb3 14. axb3 {

concerned about black taking the pawn on b3. He knows that after taking back
axb3 he would get his rook activated along the a-file and the a6 pawn would be
weak.} cxb3 {325} 18. Bxa6 {587 Cori is in deep thought now because moving the
rook to b8 can trap his knight on a5 after Bd2. Black has to play very
resourcefully to keep the balance.} Rc3 {1349} (18... b2 19. Rab1 Rc6 20. Bb5

should be able to press in this position for quite some time thanks to his a
pawn and the bishop that will sit very well on d5. But the question is whether
it is sufficient for a win?} 23. Bc4 {70} Qa5 {47} 24. g3 $1 {15 Just a small
luft for the king, but it's moves like these which showcase good technique.}
