found a 40th move which prevented his intention of Nd3 but put my queen en
prise! Realising what I had done I attempted to shake hands and resign but he
looked totally baffled so I went for a walk. About five minutes later, he
played Nd3 so I answered Nxc3 and offered a draw which he fairly soon accepted.
It was only after we'd finished that I had to tell him (sometimes it's rude to
tell your opponent they've missed something but in this case somebody else
would certainly have done so soon enough) that he could have taken my queen!}
