{A good example of powerful play and superb display of concentration is
Farrukh's win in the last round, which brought him the coveted title. I am so
impressed what a human chess mind can do, even under severe shortage of time!} 
23. Nxc6 $1 Nxc6 24. Qxb7 Rb8 25. Nf6+ Bxf6 26. Rxd6+ Ke7 27. Rd7+ Ke8 28. Qxc6
Bxb2+ 29. Kb1 {This very last and important point was crucial and made a big
difference in the prize distribution, as the other top boards drew their games.
Once the clocks had stopped, it was clear: 1st place and 30 000 USD - Amonatov;
2nd place and 20 000 - Nepomniachtchi; 3rd place and 14 000 - Jobava. All the
sweat was worth in the end!} 1-0
