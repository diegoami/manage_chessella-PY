{This study, as corercted by Prokop in July 1923, is a nice little puzzle.
White has to find the right trick to secure the draw, but once found it is
easy to equalize. Just as with the likely fictional tale of the egg of
Columbus: Getting the idea is the real point, not executing it. The Spanish
explorer was sitting together with Queen Isabella and some men and women of
blue blood, and one of them asked why his expeditions were so great if
everyone can do them. He took an egg and asked the audience to make it stand.
Naturally, they tried but the egg always fell over. Columbus took the egg,
pressed against the bottom, so the outer hull would crack but not break, and
had it stand up like that by having flattened the egg. Then he said something
among the lines of: "Doing is not the issue. Thinking is!"} 1. Rf6 $1 e1=Q (

{This work from Prokop's late years shows a "Pattwanderung", as the German
term is, a long walk out of a stalemate. The theme was most famously worked on
by the Swiss master Moriz Henneberger (16.x.1878-7.iv.1959), a strong player
who was five times Swiss champion (of this three times jointly). It's unknown
if this study was inspired by Henneberger's works, but at least it is in his
style of having a little introduction prior to getting to the "meat" of the
study.} 1. a6 Be4 $1 (1... bxa6 2. Rhh6 Kxa7 {and now something seems to be
wrong in the database I use, as White supposedly wins after 3.Rbf6 when 3.-Be4
is an easy draw. Probably 3.Rbe6 is meant, but White also can win Pa6 first:}

walk out of stalemate begins. There might be several ways to walk, but White
eventually needs to either interpose with Rb7 or his king on the seventh rank
while being able to take the rook without causing a stalemate. Black having to
get rid of Pa2 is his downfall, as it enables White to control f6 with the
bishop.} 6. Ke3 Rd8 $1 7. Bd4 a1=Q 8. Bxa1 Rd3+ 9. Kf4 Rf3+ 10. Ke5 Re3+ 11.

{Correction by Harold Lommer, British Chess Magazine/9 1950.. The original
study lacked the black pawn on c3, allowing a stalemate defense (here: 5.-Ka5
6.Kc5 Nd3+ 7.B:d3), which does not work anymore if Black still can move the
pawn after his knight is taken. The study itself shows a nice fight for the
opposition.} 1. Ke7 $1 ({White must be careful, for example} 1. Kd7 $2 Kb7 2.

{This study from February 1926 stems from a game between Lasker and Spielmann,
Moscow 1925. A year earlier, in 1924, Capablanca produced his famous double
pawn sacrifice against Tartakower in New York. The both games are given in
this list below without comments. So White is to move and win, reaching after
the second move a position that would have been reached by Lasker if Spielmann
had played 37.-Rb4 instead of 37.-Rc1. The study has a rich try-play, i.e.
refutations if White makes a wrong first move, but to me seems to add not much
over the game analysis. In all fairness, it was (according to Suetin) Prokop
who had first found the move 38.Kf4 in the game's variation (here in the study:
3.Kf4). As this shows the important point of Prokop's commentaries on master
games and how such games can turn into endgame studies, I add the study here
even as it seems to be incorrect - readers are invited to find improvements
for White.} 1. Ra8+ $1 (1. h6 $2 Rc3+ $1 2. Ke4 Rh3 $11) (1. Rh8 $2 axb4 2. h6
