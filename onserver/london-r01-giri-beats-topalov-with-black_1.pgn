1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 c6 4. Bg2 d5 5. Qa4 {Giri sank into thought after this
move. Presumably he was trying to recollect his analysis.} Nfd7 (5... Bg7 {is
the other main move here.}) 6. cxd5 Nb6 7. Qd1 cxd5 8. Nc3 Nc6 9. e3 Bg7 {
Saduakassova-Lei reached this position in August 2015. One cannot be sure
whether Topalov had seen this game before or not, but he was playing fast and
seemed to have come well prepared.} 10. Nge2 O-O 11. O-O Re8 12. b3 e5 13. dxe5
Nxe5 14. h3 (14. Bb2 Bg4 15. h3 Bf3 {is something that Topalov wanted to avoid.
}) 14... Bf5 15. Nd4 Bd3 16. Re1 Ba6 17. Qd2 {White has to make these slightly
uncomfortable moves due to the threat of the knight coming to d3. But it's fine
because the position is static in nature.} Nd3 18. Rd1 Bxd4 (18... Nxc1 19.
Raxc1 $16 {is just a huge advantage.}) 19. exd4 Qf6 20. a4 $5 {Topalov
sacrifices the d4 pawn in order to activate his rook in a very original
fashion.} (20. Bb2 {looked normal as now the d4 pawn is taboo.} Qxd4 21. Bf1 $1
$18) 20... Qxd4 21. a5 Nd7 22. Ra4 $1 {This is surely very imaginative play by
the Bulgarian.} Qe5 23. Nxd5 {White seems to have the initiative as all his
pieces are in play now.} Nxc1 (23... N7c5 {was a natural move, but Giri had
missed the brilliant resource of 25.Qg5!} 24. Rh4 $1 $44 {[%cal Gd2h6]} Nxc1 (

Nxf6+ Qxf6 26. Rf4 $16 {is also a very solid edge for White mainly because the
black king is weak and the bishop on a6 is shooting blanks.}) 25... Rad8 26.

Rf4.}) 27. Qb4 (27. Qxe5 Rxe5 28. Nxa6 bxa6 $14 {Only one person can be better
here and you don't need to be a GM to know who!}) 27... Qb2 28. Raa1 Re2 29.

draw but White is definitely not under any pressure here.}) 33... Nxf2 $1 {
White's position quickly disintegrates.} 34. Bxe2 Nxh3+ 35. Kf1 (35. Kg2 Qxe2+

his excellent co-ordination.} 36. Bh5 (36. Ke1 Qh1+ 37. Bf1 Qf3 $3 {A very
difficult move to find.} 38. Bxh3 Re8+ 39. Kd2 Re2+ 40. Kd1 Qd3#) 36... Qh1+

Veselin and a good start for Giri, who must have not expected to win this game
after the position he had after 20 moves.} (40... Ne4+ 41. Kd3 Qd2+ 42. Kc4
