Qb5 Na7 29. Qf5 Nc6 30. Kf1 $1 {Beginning a remarkable manoeuvre: White would
like to advance his pawns on the kingside to attack the target on h6 but
before White advances his pawns he brings his king to safety. He can afford
this loss of time because Black has no serious counterplay.} Re6 31. Qb5 Na7

Nc6 {White gradually makes progress while Black is just jumping around with
his knight.} 39. Bg3 Na7 40. Qb3 Nc6 41. Kc1 Re4 42. f3 Re3 43. Kb1 Ne7 $2 {
One knight-retreat too many.} ({More stubborn is} 43... Re6) 44. Bh4 $1 {
After bringing his king to safety White starts to become active - and after
the exchange of the bishop against the knight Black's position quickly
collapses.} Qd6 45. Bxe7 Rxe7 46. Rc8+ Kh7 47. Rf8 Qc7 48. f4 {Black is tied
and can only watch how White continues with his attack.} Bc5 49. Qd5 Re5 {
A last tactical trick.} ({After} 49... Bb6 50. Qf5+ g6 51. Qf6 {Black will be
mated.}) 50. Rxf7 {Black resigned. Apparently he did not want to test
Petrosian's technique in the endgame arising after 50...Rxd5 51.Rxc7 b6 52.
Nxc5 bxc5 53.Kc2.} 1-0
