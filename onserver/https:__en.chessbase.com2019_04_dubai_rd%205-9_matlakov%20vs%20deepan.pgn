against the Reti setup is one of the most solid options that Black has at his
disposal.} 4. Bg2 g6 5. b3 Bg7 6. Bb2 O-O 7. O-O Bg4 (7... Nbd7 {is the other
main move here.}) 8. d4 (8. d3 {is what White usually likes to play and after}

bishops, but his pawns in the centre limit White's bishop on f3.}) 8... Nbd7 9.
Nc3 Bxf3 {Deepan goes for the most combative idea in the position.} 10. Bxf3 e5
{On one hand opening the position if your opponent has the bishop pair is not
a great idea. But on the other, Deepan plays the position very concretely.} 11.

Nyback where the game ended in a draw. It seems as if the position is
dynamically balanced, but White's play is slightly easier.}) 12... c5 (12...

must mean something and should give White a small edge.}) 13. b4 $1 {Matlakov
immediately tries to break the structure.} b6 (13... cxb4 14. Bxd4 {would mean
that White not only has a strong bishop pair, but also strong central pawns in
the position.}) 14. Rc1 Rc8 15. Ba3 Ne5 $6 {Deepan loves to complicate but
objectively this is not a great move.} (15... cxb4 16. Rxc8 (16. Bxb4 Rxc1 17.

knight, Black would be doing really well. But when you have pawns on d5 and c5,
surely you do not need to defend the knight on a4.} (17... Qxd5 {was better

White's but the bishop on g7 cannot help them advance as the pawns are on the
same colour as the bishop. On the other hand, the knight will jump around, and
ensure that the pawns on d6 and c5 would advance.} Qf5 25. Qc4 Qxf3 (25... Rfd8
