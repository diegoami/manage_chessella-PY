{Keith is famous for his surgical technique, a master of playing the cat and
mouse game and a very persistent fellow, able to continue for hours and hours
those grinding positions which are, in a way, his signature. In a good day he
succeeds getting water out of the driest stone and this game was yet another
example showing that where there's a will there's a way! Applying constant
pressure on your opponent and leaving no room for breathing or relaxing is a
good way to go and indeed, it paid off. However...the point was tucked in by a
hair!} 71. Ra1 {After a long day in the office, the allegedly 'weaker' player
was about to go home with a well deserved and hard fought half a point. This
very last move is not yet fatal but it is the beginning of the end...} ({
'Easier' was} 71. Kc1 $1 {which is the way to keep on holding, the point being
that after} Rb4 72. Ra3+ Kc4 73. Kc2 {the idea of} Kb5 74. Kd3 {and} Ra4 {
is not really working in view of} 75. Rb3+ Kc6 76. Rc3+ Kd7 77. Rb3 Kc7 78.
Rc3+ Kb8 79. Rc5 {and draw.}) 71... Rb4 {and now definitely not} 72. Kc1 $2 {
which loses on the spot} ({better was} 72. Rc1+ Kb2 73. Rc2+ Kb3 74. Rc1 Rb5
75. Ra1 Kb4 76. Kc2 Rc5+ 77. Kd3 Rc7 78. Kd2 {and White still holds.}) 72...
Rh4 {obviously the a5 pawn will be lost without any further counter-play from
White's side. Yes, that's right. It is very difficult to win a game of chess
these days; in some cases rating is just a number and says little if anything,
about the real strength of your opponent.} 0-1

{Seems like Keith is a big fan of endgames:) He should have won this one but
it was not so easy. Try to find the winning method on your own!} 56... Kg6 {
was played, after which the worst is over for White, as proven in the game.} (
56... Ra8 {is not working because of} 57. Rb1 e1=Q 58. Rxe1 Rxa7 59. Rb1 {
and a peaceful result.}) ({The winning ticket was} 56... Rf8+ $1 57. Ke3 Ra8 (
57... Rd8 $2 58. Kf2 {and again a draw}) 58. Rb1 e1=Q+ 59. Rxe1 Re8+ 60. Kd2
Rxe1 61. Kxe1 b1=Q+ {I know, looks 'easy' even to yours truly, but I gave this
position to other strong chess players and they had to think a bit to find out
the solution. Imagine you have to find these subtle nuances over the board,
after having played for many hours and with double rounds... it is never so
simple.}) 57. Kf2 Kg5 58. Rb1 Kg4 59. Ke1 Ra8 1/2-1/2

{Every GM had some tough times in Cardiff and perhaps the most scary one for
the English GM was the one of round 4.} 33... Kf7 {is not a crucial blunder
but it does feel a bit like stumbling on the threshold,.} (33... Rxe5 {would
have won on the spot} 34. Rxe5 Qxh3+ 35. Qh2 Qf1+) 34. Qh4 h6 {The game
continued and even ended in a miraculous draw for White but the hunting chess
ghosts will probably be sharking for a while, for both players I believe.} 35.
