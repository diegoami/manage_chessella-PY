{Some experts believe that Rado must be a tough opponent for Magnus. Part of it
is Wojtaszek's experience as Vishy Anand's primary opening theory specialist
during his preparation for the World Championship matches, which we assume
included their going over every game Carlsen ever played. There's also a
memorable upset win Radoslaw scored two years ago on the same stage at the 2015
Tata Steel tournament.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.
a3 $5 {Just like that Carlsen goes off the theoretical path as early as on Move
6, repeating Karjakin's experiment from round one. We can safely assume
Wojtaszek was not prepared to face it.} e5 {It is largely a matter of taste.
Rado goes the Najdorf way,} ({while some of us would prefer the Scheveningen
Variation after} 6... e6 7. f4 Nc6 8. Nf3) 7. Nf5 ({Much more common is} 7. Nf3
{if the word "common" can be applied to the 6.a3 line at all. Russian GM
Dvoyris played it a couple of times, and there also was a recent blitz game
Harikrishna-Giri. All in all, the white pawn on a3 does not look out of place,
and a tempo spend on that move is the same tempo White often loses by stopping
over on e3 with his DSB on its way to g5.}) 7... d5 8. Bg5 d4 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 $2
{I ablosutely loathe this move. In the name of preserving his pawn structure
intact Black invites another White knight to come up to the center of the
board.} (9... gxf6 10. Ne2 Qb6 ({or} 10... Qa5+ 11. Qd2 Qxd2+ 12. Kxd2 Be6) 11.
Rb1 (11. b4 a5 $132) 11... Be6 12. Qc1 Nd7 {has to be absolutely fine for
Black.}) 10. Nd5 Qd8 11. Qg4 $1 {Carlsen immediately hits on the right idea.}
Bxf5 ({The point was to answer} 11... g6 {with} 12. Qg3 Nc6 13. Nxd4 $1) 12.
Qxf5 {Already here it became painfully clear that White will win this game.
Magnus always wins when he can get his pieces to safe squares, and the opponent
doesn't have any dynamic possibilities.} Bd6 13. h4 $5 Nc6 14. Bc4 b5 15. Bb3
Ne7 16. Qg4 O-O 17. Rh3 Nxd5 18. Bxd5 Ra7 19. Rg3 Qf6 20. a4 { This move
indicates Magnus's desire to open a second front. He must have felt his K-side
intiative alone wouldn't be enough.} Bb4+ $2 {And Wojtaszek just plays along!}
(20... b4 {had to be the right move simply because it does not accommodate the
opponent's intentions.}) 21. Kf1 bxa4 22. Rxa4 a5 23. Ra1 Rc7 24. Bb3 Ra8 25.
Kg1 Bf8 26. Qh5 g6 27. Qg4 Ra6 28. h5 Qf4 29. Qe2 Qf6 30. Qb5 Qc6 $4 ({I don't
see anything wrong with.} 30... Rc5) 31. Qxe5 Re7 32. Qf4 a4 33. Bd5 Qc7 34.

Rd7 41. Qd1 Rf6 42. Rxf6 Kxf6 43. c3 dxc3 44. Rxa4 {We have seen enough games
like this. What are these guys thinking playing passively against Magnus
Carlsen?} 1-0
