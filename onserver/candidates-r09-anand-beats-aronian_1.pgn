e5 9. d5 c6 10. h4 cxd5 11. exd5 Na6 $5 {[%cal Gb8a6] This is a pretty uncommon
move and the strongest player to have tried it is rated around 2400.} (11...
N8d7 {is much more common.}) 12. h5 Nb4 13. hxg6 Bf5 $5 {[%cal Gc8f5] What an
interesting idea by Caruana: giving up two pawns and using his lead in
development to create dangerous threats. Although it looks totally scary for
White, Anish kept his cool and was able to extinguish Black's initiative.} (

17. Qxe3 Bd7 {Caruana played this with the idea of f5, but turns out that it
wasn't particularly good.} (17... Rc8 {was much better.}) 18. Nh3 f5 19. f4 $1
{[%cal Gf3f4] A strong positional move by Anish.} Rc8 20. g3 (20. fxe5 f4 $132
21. Nxf4 Qg5 22. g3 Bxe5) 20... Nc4 $2 {The biggest mistake of the game. After
this Anish should have won.} (20... e4 {was better.}) 21. Bxc4 Rxc4 22. fxe5
$18 {[%cal Gh3f4] White is just two pawns up without any compensation.} f4 {
Fabiano realises that he is completely lost and tries to sacrifice more
material to complicate the issue.} 23. Nxf4 Qg5 24. Rd4 {The most normal move
from the human point of view.} (24. e6 Rcxf4+ 25. gxf4 Rxf4+ 26. Ke2 Bb5+ 27.
Nxb5 Qg2+ 28. Kd3 Qg6+ 29. Kd2 Qg2+ 30. Qe2 Rf2) (24. Ke1 $1 {This was the move
that would have given Anish victory. However, for a human it is not so easy to
find.} Bxe5 25. Ng6+ (25. Qxe5+ Qxe5+) 25... Qxg6 26. Qxe5+ Qg7 27. Qxg7+ Kxg7)
24... Rxd4 25. Qxd4 Bxe5 26. Qb4 $1 {Of course this was the point of Rd4. The
rook on f8 is hanging and White keeps his advantage.} Rf7 (26... Re8 27. Kg2)

30. Qe3 b6 {Although White has three extra pawns it is extremely difficult for
him to convert because the two bishops control many squares and it is not so
easy to advance the pawns.} (30... Bxb2 31. Qxa7) 31. b3 Re7 32. Qd2 Rc7 33. d6
{Although the computer gives many different ways for White to play for the
advantage, Anish finds this the most human, clearing the d5 square for his
pieces.} Bxd6 (33... Qxd6 34. Qxd6 Bxd6 {should also be defensible.}) 34. Qd5

Bxe2 38. Qa8+ Rf8 39. Rg8+ Kxh7 40. Rxf8 Bxf8 41. Nxe2 {is similar to what was
reached in the game, but with the different bishop.}) 37... Qxh6 38. Qxf7 Qc6+

{This should most probably end in a draw although it is not 100% clear as Black
cannot easy exchange the queenside pawns.}) 43. Qf6+ {From here on the players
make a lot of moves and a lot of checks. Suffice it to say that White is still
better, but with the two bishops around the black king it is extremely
difficult to break through.} Kg8 44. Qg6+ Kf8 45. Qh6+ Kg8 46. Qg5+ Kf8 47.
