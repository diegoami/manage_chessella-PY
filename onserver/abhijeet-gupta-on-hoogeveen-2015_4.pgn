{This last round victory helped Gupta to claim the title. Little would he have
known that he would be able to beat his grandmaster opponent in just 20 moves.
} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 d5 4. Bg2 Bb4+ 5. Nd2 O-O 6. Ngf3 dxc4 7. Qc2 b5 (
7... Nc6 {is the other possibility.}) 8. a4 bxa4 9. Ne5 $1 {Excellent piece of
homework. As Abhijeet explained: if Black cannot take on d4 with his queen then
White gets a superior version of the 9.0-0 line.} (9. O-O {is the main move
played once by Boris Gelfand, but Abhijeet has a new idea up his sleeve.} Bb7
10. Nxc4 c5 $13) 9... Nd5 ({The real test of Abhijeet's idea was} 9... Qxd4
{but after} 10. O-O $1 Qxe5 11. Nxc4 Qb5 12. Bxa8 {White has a clear advantage.
} c6 {The bishop cannot be trapped on a8 as after} 13. Rxa4 $1 Ba6 14. b3 $16 {
White is better.}) 10. O-O Bb7 11. Ndxc4 $16 {White is just clearly better. The
a4 pawn will soon fall and then the a7 and c7 pawns would be weak.} c5 12. e4
Nf6 13. dxc5 (13. d5 {was also quite powerful.} exd5 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. Rd1 $18)
13... Bxc5 14. Rd1 Qe7 (14... Qc7 {was preferable.} 15. Bf4 Nh5 16. Bd2 $16
{White has an advantage but not as huge as in the game.}) 15. Bg5 h6 16. Bxf6
Qxf6 (16... gxf6 17. Ng4 $18) 17. Nd3 {Threatening e4-e5.} Na6 (17... Bd4 18.
Nd6 Bc6 19. e5 Bxe5 20. Bxc6 Nxc6 21. Qxc6 $18) 18. Na5 $1 {The bishop on b7
has nowhere to go and the next move after taking it White goes e4-e5.} Qe7 19.
Nxb7 Qxb7 20. Qxa4 $1 {The knight on a6 cannot be defended, and if it moves,
the c5 bishop falls and hence White wins a piece. An easy victory for Gupta
thanks to some high class opening prepation.} (20. e5 {was also strong but
Abhijeet finds the easiest way to win.}) 1-0
