{Usually would never like to see players from the same country in this type of
strong tournaments, but that's the way chess, today Raja, Harshit and
Karthikeyan gave us a duel worthy of being seen on the third board of this
World Junior.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 6. Bg5 e6
7. Qd3 Be7 8. O-O-O O-O 9. h4 {Attractive preparation, The most usual line is:}
(9. f4 h6 10. Bh4 e5 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. fxe5 dxe5 13. Qxd8 Rxd8 $14 {With a
very close position and with chances for both sides.}) 9... Nxd4 10. Qxd4 e5 ({
e5 is not a usual move in this order, it can be interesting but at the same
time it brings with it an immediate alteration of the position, a slightly
quieter idea can be:} 10... Bd7 11. Qd2 Bc6 12. f3 a6 13. Ne2 Rc8 14. Nd4 Nd7
15. Kb1 Bf6 16. g4 d5 17. f4 Nc5 18. e5 Be7 19. Qe3 {1-0 (40)}) 11. Qd2 $146
Be6 12. Kb1 a6 13. Be2 b5 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. Qxd6 Qa5 {It should also be
considered the change of Queens and enter the end game with opposite bichops
although pawn dawn:} (15... Qxd6 16. Rxd6 Rfd8 17. Rxd8+ Rxd8 18. a3 g6 $14)
16. Nd5 Bxd5 17. Rxd5 Rac8 {[#]} 18. Qa3 $2 {Losing the advantage, the white
pieces try to arrive at end game with opposite bichops but in the practice we
have been discovered it is not as draw as it seem, in recent times the GMs
arround the world have been in charge of demonstrating that with a small
advantage they can materialize even end games that some time ago some players
agreed draw without playing.} (18. Qd7 Rfd8 19. Qf5 Qb6 20. g4 $16 {The
advantage of space in the king side and the extra pawn made his position very
strong, this was one of the continuations that Harshit should have executed.})
18... Qxa3 19. bxa3 Rc6 {The relief of the black pieces can be felt, from
facing a position with a pawn down, now he can take advantage of this endgame
where although there is an opposite bichops, the bad white structure gives
some hope of victory.} 20. h5 Rfc8 21. Rhd1 (21. c4 {A very interesting idea
of defense, after bxc4 the white king will be safe in c2 try to activate the
bishop and take advantage of the open columns d and b will be the object.} bxc4
22. Kc2 Rb8 23. Rb1 Rxb1 24. Kxb1 Kf8 25. Kc2 Bh4 {Small maneuver to try to
free the bishop from the defense of e5} 26. g3 Be7 27. Rxe5 Bxa3 $14 {Very
balanced position where getting the full point is a very difficult task for
both players}) 21... g6 22. Rd6 Be7 23. Rxc6 Rxc6 24. hxg6 Rxg6 25. Bf3 Bxa3

Waiting move too passive, no matter how equal the position is, finding the
best and active square for each piece will always be the best option.} h5 39.

Kg6 46. g3 $6 {Although passive the best square for the pawn was g2, it seems
that it was too late to look for some activity, maybe the best decision was to
try to defend from there future plans of the black incursion.} f5 $1 47. exf5+

54. Kxa4 e4 $1 {A nice class of Karthikeyan, who being very inferior in the
middle game, hope and always found the best move until his opponent made some
small mistakes that he took advantage of in a categorical way.} 55. Rd4 Rxf5
56. Rxe4 Rf7 0-1
