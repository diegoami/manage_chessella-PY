{Hello Everyone! This is GM Aleksandr Lenderman with Moscow Grand Prix round 8
game of the day. I decided to choose the draw between Svidler and Mamedyarov
because I thought it was a good complex battle amongst the leaders of the
tournament.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 b5 6. Bb3 Bc5 {
According to my database this is the first time Mamedyarov has played this line
in the Ruy Lopez. In general though Mamedyarov plays many different options
even on move 1.} 7. Nc3 {When Mamedyarov chose 6...Bc5, he was probably basing
his preparation on Svidler's recent game against Ding Liren, in which he
replied with 7. c3, and Black got a good position in that game.} ( 7. c3 O-O 8.

-Ding Liren (2759) Shenzhen CHN 2017}) 7... d6 (7... O-O {Ding chose this
against Adams.}) 8. Nd5 h6 9. c3 O-O 10. Nxf6+ Qxf6 11. Bd5 Bd7 (11... Bb7 $6
12. g4 $36) 12. Rg1 Ne7 $5 {Up to here it was all played before but this
interesting exchange sacrifise is a novelty according to my database. Before
that a few other moves were tried.} (12... Qd8 13. g4 Kh8 14. g5 $40 {was very
dangerous in Vachier Lagrave,M (2789)-Giri,A (2782) Paris FRA 2016 (drawn in 36
moves)}) (12... Rae8 13. g4 $36 {Is also very good for White.}) (12... h5 $5
{Is the engine suggestion but of course this move might be very dangerous and
I'm not sure if this move will have many followers. I guess it remains to be
seen whether 12. h5!? withstands deep home analysis.}) 13. Bxa8 Rxa8 14. g4 Qe6
{Black is just down an exchange but he has positional compensation in the two
bishops, soon control of the center, and also very importantly Black was able
to neutralize White's attack.} 15. Nh4 {A possible move but not sure if it's
the best move.} (15. Be3 $5 {Perhaps it deserved attention to just exchange
Black's strong bishop and trade off some pieces.} Bxe3 16. fxe3 d5 17. Nd2 $16
{And neither me, nor my engine see enough compensation here for Black.}) 15...
d5 16. Nf5 Bc6 17. Qe2 (17. Nxe7+ Bxe7 18. Qe2 {Was also a try for an
advantage, not allowing the Black knight to be strong on g6 and controlling the
f4 square.}) 17... dxe4 18. dxe4 Ng6 19. Kf1 $6 {This is probably already an
inaccuracy.} (19. Rg2 $3 {This brilliant, albeit clumsy looking move is simply
a prophylaxis against Nf4, to be able to prepare the move f3, unpinning the
f-pawn, currently protecting the rook on g1 from Bc5} Nf4 (19... b4 20. c4 $16)
20. Bxf4 exf4 21. f3 $16) 19... Nf4 (19... b4 $5 {was also possible.}) 20. Bxf4
exf4 21. Re1 {It also deserved attention here to give up material but Black
also seems to have sufficient play then.} (21. f3 $5 Bxg1 22. Kxg1 Rd8 $11)

Prophylaxis against Nd4.} 23. Kh1 g6 24. Nd4 Bxd4 25. cxd4 Rxd4 26. f3 Bb5 $44)
22. b4 Bb6 23. f3 $1 {Otherwise Black has a very strong initiative. Possibly
Black underestimated this reply.} Bxg1 24. Kxg1 Bd7 25. Rd1 Qb6+ 26. Qf2 Bxf5
27. gxf5 Qxf2+ 28. Kxf2 a5 {Now the game will end peacefully from here.} 29. a3
axb4 30. axb4 Ra8 31. Rd7 c6 32. Rc7 Ra2+ 33. Kg1 Ra1+ 34. Kg2 Ra2+ 35. Kg1
Ra1+ 36. Kg2 Ra2+ 37. Kh3 h5 38. Rxc6 f6 39. c4 {After bxc4 Rxc4 Rb2, White
can't make any further progress with his king stuck on h3 and never being able
to get into the game. Therefore draw agreed. A short but very interesting and
instructive battle on the top board at the Moscow Grand Prix.} 1/2-1/2
