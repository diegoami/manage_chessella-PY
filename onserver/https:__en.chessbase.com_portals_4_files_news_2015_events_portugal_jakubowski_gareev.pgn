gxf5 h5 44. Rh4 Rb3) 41. Kf2 Kf6 42. Ra4 {Shortly after time control I went
into the tank trying to figure out the winning plan. As I was contemplating,
GM Kevin Spraggett playing on board 2 ended up getting lucky and won his game
vs a local International Master. Spraggett initiated a lively verbal analysis
with his opponent despite a few games going around him. Realizing that this
may continue for awhile, I reached and tapped on Kevin/^s table to indicate
they must be quite. That did not please Kevin who called arbiter and continued
talking. As I looked at Kevin a moment later he shouted (+)you can/^t even
talk to me, shut your face![+] I responded letting him know he needs to be
quite and leave the room. The unpleasant interaction certainly affected my
play. I continued to take lots of time but did not find the correct resource:}

advantage goes away as I miss a couple important moves.} Rd3 46. g5+ Kf7 47.

I miss white's next idea:} 50. Ng4 Rd4+ 51. Kxe5 Rd2 {Here I offered a draw
and after some thought Krystoff agreed. That surprised me since he had 13
minutes and I only had a little over a minute on the clock with 30 sec
increment added after each move.} (51... Rd2 52. Ne3 Re2 $1 53. Kd4 Rd2+ 54.
Kxc4 Kd6 55. a4 Rh2 {is close to equality but still would have been a
challenge for me to play out to a draw. Perhaps Krystoff felt I had the edge
throughout the game and decided to show courtesy due to earlier incident.}) *
