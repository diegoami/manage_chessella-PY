1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 $5 {Enough of the Anti-Berlins. I think Anand must
have given his seconds a full day to find something in the Berlin for White,
and if they could not he would decide to go for the Giuoco Piano. And this
looks like an excellent decision, especially because Anand needs to win this
one.} Bc5 4. O-O d6 5. d3 Nf6 6. c3 a6 7. a4 Ba7 8. Na3 {You can bank on Anand
to have a new idea up his sleeve in whatever opening he played.} Ne7 9. Nc2 Ng6
10. Be3 O-O 11. Bxa7 Rxa7 12. Ne3 Ng4 $6 {The main reason why this move is not
so great is because it takes away the pressure from the e4 pawn and helps White
to go d4.} 13. Qd2 a5 (13... Nxe3 14. Qxe3 Ra8 15. a5 {might be what Levon was
afraid of and is the reason why he played a6-a5.}) 14. d4 $1 Ra8 15. dxe5 N4xe5
(15... dxe5 16. Qxd8 Rxd8 17. Rad1 $1 $16) 16. Nxe5 Nxe5 (16... dxe5 17. Qxd8
Rxd8 18. Rfd1 $14) 17. Bb3 {[%csl Rd6,Ge4] The e4 pawn against the one on d6
gives White a small advantage.} Nd7 18. Bc2 Re8 19. f3 {A restrained move for
the time being. White would like to co-ordinate his pieces better and later he
can decide whether he would like to expand on the kingside with f4 or on the
queenside with b4.} b6 20. Rfd1 Nc5 21. b4 Nd7 22. Bb3 Nf6 23. Qd4 Qe7 $6 {This
was pointed out by Anand and Aronian as a careless move. Now Nd5 gives White a
nice edge.} (23... Be6 {could be an improvement, although this too looks better
for White.}) 24. Nd5 {A very practical and pragmatic move. White leads the
position into one-sided play.} Nxd5 25. Bxd5 {Only White can be better here. He
has the better minor piece and also more space.} Ra7 26. b5 $1 {Anand is doing
all the right things here. But still his advantage is at best pleasant, not
decisive. He needs Aronian to make errors in order to win. With accurate play
this looks like a draw.} Bb7 (26... Be6 {was also possible.} ) 27. c4 Qe5
(27... Bxd5 {This was Aronian's original intention.} 28. cxd5 Raa8 29. Rac1
Rad8 30. Rc6 Rd7 31. Rdc1 Qd8 32. R1c4 Ree7 33. Qc3 {and here Black doesn't
mange to hold because Rxb6 is a threat and after} Qb8 34. e5 $1 { is really
strong.} Rxe5 (34... dxe5 35. d6 $1 $18) 35. Rxc7 $16) 28. Rac1 (28. Qxe5 Rxe5
29. Kf2 $14 {is similar to the game.}) 28... Qxd4+ 29. Rxd4 Kf8 30. Kf2 Ke7 31.
f4 {Anand opens the third rank for his rook to go to h3 or g3 via c3.} f6 32.
Rc3 Kd7 33. Rh3 h6 34. Rg3 Re7 35. Rg6 (35. f5 Bxd5 36. cxd5 { also looks like
a plan. Of course e4 is a weakness, but White can take care of it with Kf3, and
he can slowly develop the final kingside breakthrough with h4-g4-g5. However,
the problem in this scenario is that the area of battle is just too small and
Black can be ready for this. Hence, Anand doesn't go for the committal pawn
move with f5.}) 35... Bxd5 36. cxd5 Ra8 37. Kf3 {This is not a pleasant
position to be in as Black, that is for sure.} Rae8 38. Kg4 $1 { Maybe an
exclamation here is generous. But the point that I am trying to make here is
that good players know when to change the character of the position. Vishy
knows that if he goes for a kingside pawn storm nothing much will come out of
it. On the other hand in this position with the king coming to f5 and the
opponent in severe time pressure (two moves to reach the time control) things
can go completely wrong. This was a very smart move by Anand.} Rxe4 { Anand was
surprised that Aronian took this pawn without much thought.} (38... Kd8 39. Kf5
{only improves White's chances. One cannot be sure whether it is winning or
not, but it definitely is no fun for Black.}) 39. Rxg7+ Kc8 $6 ( 39... Kd8 {was
more accurate as then the c7 pawn doesn't fall with check.} 40. Rd2 Rxa4 41.
Rc2 Re5 $1 42. Rcxc7 Rg5+ $1 {I wonder if Levon would have found this nice
defensive idea. It surely doesn't look easy to find over the board.} 43. Kf3
Rxg7 44. Rxg7 Rd4 $11) 40. Rd2 $1 {Keeping the rooks makes it difficult for
Black to play freely as there is always counterplay associated with the c7
pawn.} Kb8 $6 {"Stupid 40th move" was Levon's statement after the game. "I
should have played Kb7." But is there such a huge difference between Kb8 and
Kb7?} (40... Rxa4 41. Rc2 $36) (40... Kb7 41. Rc2 Rc8 42. Ra2 Rd4 43. Kf5 Rxd5+
44. Kxf6 {And we reach a position that is similar to the game. I don't
understand the difference between Kb7 and Kb8.}) 41. Rc2 Rc8 42. Ra2 $1 { After
making the black rook passive for a while White returns to defend the a4 pawn.}
Rd4 43. Kf5 {The main advantage for White in this position is his king
activity. Look at the guy on b8 and look at the king on f5. White is just
better.} Rxd5+ 44. Kxf6 Rf8+ 45. Rf7 $1 {A very nice deicision, transposing the
game into a winning single rook endgame.} Rxf7+ 46. Kxf7 Rf5+ 47. Kg6 Rxf4 48.
g3 $1 {The final accurate move to get double passed pawns on the kingside.} Rc4
49. Kxh6 d5 50. Kh5 {Not the best move in the position, and Vishy said that he
was sort of embarassed because he didn't go Kg5. It's true that Kg5 wins
easier, but this is also winning.} (50. Kg5 {was of course the easier way to
win the game.} d4 51. h4 d3 52. Rd2 Rxa4 53. h5 Rb4 54. h6 Rxb5+ 55. Kg6 $18
{and White just wins.}) 50... d4 51. g4 $6 (51. h4 d3 52. Rd2 Rd4 53. Kg5 { and
even with the lost tempo, White wins.}) 51... d3 52. h4 Rd4 (52... Rc2 53. Ra1
d2 54. Rd1 $18) 53. Rd2 Kc8 {White's task has become much harder because the
black king is coming to stop the white pawns where as the d3 pawn makes the
rook passive.} 54. g5 $1 Kd7 55. Kg6 $1 {A brave decision by Anand to give up
the h4 pawn, but he sees that he can win the game.} Rxh4 (55... Ke8 { was
another move and now White's road to victory is not so wide.} 56. h5 Kf8 (
56... Rd6+ 57. Kg7) 57. h6 Rd6+ 58. Kf5 $1 {The only winning move.} (58. Kh7

This is the crucial move, not so easy to make.} Rxa4 60. Rxc7+ Kd6 61. Rc6+ $18

winning, but this is just better technique!} 1-0
