{Save the day for White: Rxd2 or Ree2?} 34. Ree2 {was played missing Black's
devious idea.} (34. Rxd2 Rxd2+ 35. Re2 Rc2 36. Rxc2 bxc2 37. Ne2 {just in time.
}) 34... Rxe2 35. Rxe2 Nc3 $1 {and suddenly Black is winning. Thus by taking
the d2-rook first, White avoids the Nc3 and Nd1 hidden resource.} 36. Rf2 Nd1
37. Rxc2 bxc2 38. Nd3 Nxb2 {and Black won a few moves later.} 0-1
