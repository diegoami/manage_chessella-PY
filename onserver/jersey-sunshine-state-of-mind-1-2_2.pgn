{This game is so much fun, just like its owner, Simon! His over optimistic
approach though turned out to be too risky and backfired in the skillful hands
of Merry Alan.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c5 3. d5 b5 4. Bg5 a6 5. a4 b4 6. Nbd2 Nxd5 {
the first pawn goes down in flames.} 7. e4 Nc7 8. Nc4 f6 9. Be3 d6 10. e5 $1 {
another one bites the dust!} dxe5 11. Bd3 {choosing to keep the ladies on the
board.} ({I believe Simon considered the following line to give compensation
for Black.} 11. Qxd8+ Kxd8 12. Nb6 e6 13. Nxa8 Nxa8 {How would the engines
assess this position?! Slightly better for White but I think Black's play
should be easier, from a practical point of view.}) 11... Be6 12. Nb6 Nd7 13.
Nxa8 Qxa8 14. Nd2 g6 (14... Qxg2 {the third pawn would be more than welcome but
it feels a bit too greedy} 15. Be4 Qh3 16. Nb3 c4 17. Na5 {asses that if you
can!}) 15. O-O Bg7 16. f4 Nd5 17. Qe2 Bh6 18. Nc4 Nxe3 19. Qxe3 Qd5 20. Rae1
Nf8 21. Rd1 Bxf4 22. Qf2 (22. Qe2 {the queens should have still remained on the
board, since Black's king is not yet completely safe.}) 22... Qd4 23. g3 Bxc4
24. gxf4 Bxd3 25. Rxd3 Qxf2+ 26. Kxf2 exf4 {another soldier falls on duty} 27.
c3 Ne6 28. cxb4 cxb4 29. Rc1 Kf7 30. Rc6 a5 31. Rd5 Ra8 32. Kf3 g5 33. Ke4 h5
34. h4 gxh4 35. Rxh5 Ng5+ 36. Kxf4 h3 37. Rc5 {was not necessary but I doubt
White can still put up a fight against the massive number of black pawns. In a
true sportsmanship style, Simon congratulated his opponent for his surgical
technique in mastering the initiative and despite feeling scandalized with his
own play, went on to analyze the game!} Ne6+ 0-1
