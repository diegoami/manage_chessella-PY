his opening choice from the Dubov match earlier this week.} 8. a4 b4 9. Nfd2 $1
{From what I remember from my analysis of this position with English IM Ravi
Haria, moving this knight is slightly better, and while Black achieves the
bishop-pair imbalance he is undoubtedly after, the objective evaluation is in
White's favour.} (9. Nbd2 Bb7 10. Nxc4 c5 11. dxc5 Be4 {Here I commented that
White seemed to have a stable advantage in a few ways - however, people that
play the Black side of the Catalan specialise in minimising very slight pulls
in mathematically precise fashion, raising the question of whether they were
ever there to begin with...} 12. Qd2 $5 Nbd7 $5 13. Nfe5 ({It seems like White
should have continued with the principled} 13. Qxb4 $5 Nxc5 14. Nfe5 $44 {
when I wasn't able to find a conclusive route for Black to regain the pawn or
get full compensation.}) 13... Bxg2 (13... Nxe5 14. Nxe5 Qc7 $5 $36) 14. Kxg2

position was equal, but maybe easier for White to play, and Black soon made
some inaccuracies before proceeding to draw anyway. Dubov,D-Nakamura, H Moscow

this line is sometimes the amount of computer chess White has to play. For
instance, after} 11... Qg4 12. Bf4 Qg6 13. Qc1 Nd5 (13... Ba6 14. Ne5 Qf5 15.

advantage consists of the mysterious pawn sacrifice} 17. Nd2 Bg5 18. Qc5 $1

bishop pair.} 14. Nf3 Nxe3 15. Nxe3 a5 16. Nd4 Ba6 17. Rac1 Rc8 $1 {I believe
this is a novelty, but it's quite natural.} ({White should play the same way

to think about playing Rh1 in connection with kingside pawn pushes, and also
avoiding any kind of tricks along the a7-g1 diagonal.} ({The machines suggest
the oddly prophylactic} 22. Qd2 $5 {discouraging ...Ra7 due to a tactical
wrinkle, but I prefer the plan of playing for Nc5.} Ra7 23. Nxc6 Nxc6 24. Rxc6
Rxc6 25. Qd8+ Bf8 26. Bxc6 Qe5 $1 $14 {White's advantage is minimal and the
position is so double-edged that he could easily be lost within 5 moves.})

turn- the evidence is inconclusive, but it's definitely one idea and it seems
Black was worried about it.} g6 24. f4 {So it has become clear what White
wants: Bf3 and Nb3.} Qh6 ({One interesting idea is making White work for his ..
.Qh6 retreat, and using the extra time to get ...Qg7/f8 in as well.} 24... Rac7

positionally, but on the other hand Black has two connected passed pawns,
neither of which can ever be captured- so if he were able to activate the
b8-knight and then sacrifice an exchange, the game would be very much on.}) 29.

a Catalan pull: White only has a symbolic advantage now. The machines will
keep giving +0.3, though, until that moment when they inexplicably switch to
+0.01.}) 25. Nb3 Kh8 ({Black can somehow keep the a5-pawn, but then his
position crumbles somewhere else.} 25... f5 26. Bd3 c5 27. Bxa6 Rxa6 28. Nc4

requires the intricate Qd2! in order to not simply be lost.} 27. Qd2 $1 (27.

vague sort of control over the light squares, but it is unsurprising that he
didn't go for this.}) ({The engine suggestion} 26. Nc5 $14 {is valid, but
humans would be concerned about eventually reaching some unwinnable ending
with queens, opposite-coloured bishops and 4v3 on the kingside (say.)}) 26...

more effort to organise a break after} 28... Bxe4+ 29. Qxe4 Qf8 30. Nbxa5 h5

question to answer about the a5-knight, which is to some extent pinned.}) 29.

control}) 31... Bf6 ({Black's chance at counterplay was} 31... g5 $1 {Probably
he rejected it because of the thematic} 32. f5 {fearing that his e7-bishop
would then be even worse than before; however, as long as it can get to f6,
Black is alive.} Bc8 33. e4 exf5 34. exf5 Bf6 35. g4 {To avoid Black playing ..
.g4 and using the g-file.} h6 $1 $14 {Black has the makings of a middlegame
fortress.}) 32. Rxd8 Qxd8 33. Rd1 Rd7 34. Rxd7 Nxd7 35. h6 {After this,
Black's position becomes practically impossible to defend, even if the move
isn't strictly best.} (35. Qe4 $1 $16 {causes Black to go into some
contortions in order not to lose a piece on the spot.}) 35... Nb6 $2 (35... Kg8
