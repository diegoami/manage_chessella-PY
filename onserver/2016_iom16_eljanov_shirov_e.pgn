1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Bg4 3. Bg2 Nd7 4. O-O Ngf6 5. h3 Bxf3 6. Bxf3 e6 7. d3 Bd6 8.
Bg2 O-O 9. Nd2 c6 10. e4 e5 11. a4 a5 12. exd5 cxd5 {[#]} 13. Nb1 $1 {A
surprising - and surprisingly strong - retreat. White sends his knight back to
its initial square to exploit the weaknesses on d5 and b5.} Bb4 14. c3 Bd6 15.
Na3 Bxa3 16. Rxa3 {White now plays with his bishops against Black's knights
and has a clear strategic advantage. Eljanov's seemingly innocuous opening
strategy turned out to be a success.} Rc8 17. Rb3 b6 18. Rb5 Nc5 19. d4 exd4
20. Qxd4 Nfe4 21. Bf4 Nd6 {[#]Black gives a pawn to reduce White's pressure
and to entertain hopes of counterplay. But Eljanov shows good technique and
convincingly converts his extra-pawn.} 22. Bxd6 Qxd6 23. Bxd5 Rfd8 24. Rd1 Qg6
25. Qg4 Qxg4 26. hxg4 Nxa4 27. Rd4 Nc5 28. Rxb6 Kf8 29. g5 Rb8 30. Rxb8 Rxb8 {
[#]} 31. Rf4 $1 {White refuses to defend his b-pawn passively and
counterattacks instead. He realised that Black's a-pawn looks more dangerous
than it is.} Ke7 32. Rxf7+ Kd6 33. c4 g6 34. Rxh7 Rxb2 35. Rg7 a4 36. Rxg6+ Ke5
