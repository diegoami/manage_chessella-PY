O-O Bf8 9. Bd2 b6 10. Nf4 {A novelty at the grandmaster level. The usual move
is 10.Rc1 to develop the rook and fight against the impending ...c5. Here White
chooses to combine a fight against d5, preparing Rad1 once ...c5 dxc5 is
played, with possible pressure against the kingside.} Bb7 11. Qf3 a6 12. Rad1 {
[#]} Ra7 $3 {A fantastic move that shows just how inspired Inarkiev is. This
seemingly odd move actually sets the stage for Black to fight back and play for
the win himself. The point is to clear the a8 square for the queen, allowing
not only Black to develop his knight on c6 or d7 without abandoning his pawn on
d5, but also setting up a battery of queen and bishop on the long diagonal
a8-h1. After ...c5 and dxc5, Black will then be ready to shove a nasty ...d4 of
his own, when appropriate.} 13. Bc2 c5 14. dxc5 bxc5 15. Qh3 g6 16. Nce2 Bc6
17. Bc3 Nbd7 18. Bb3 Qa8 {[#] Both players have been quite consistent in their
plans. White has set up pressure on d5 with some extra threats on the kingside
if possible, while Black has also set up his plans. In a sense it is a bit
unusual because usually grandmasters will work to impede their opponent's ideas
as much as pomote their own, but here it seems a bit of a macho 'go ahead and
do your worst and we'll see who is left standing.'} 19. g4 $2 {Probably even
deserving of two question marks. With that battery of Qa8 and Bc6, one would
think opening up the king with g4, precisely that diagonal, would be the last
thing one should do. Sure enough, White will be punished swiftly for his
temerity.} Ne5 20. g5 $4 {Black's threat is obvious, and Navara is certainly
strong enough to sense the risk even from afar, so one can only presume a
moment of utter chess blindness.} d4 $1 21. f3 dxc3 22. gxf6 c4 23. Bc2 Nxf3+

played by Black wins no less clearly, and possibly with fewer complications.}
