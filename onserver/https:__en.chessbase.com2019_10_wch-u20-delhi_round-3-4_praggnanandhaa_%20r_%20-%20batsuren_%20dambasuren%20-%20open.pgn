1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Praggnanandhaa likes to play the Italian but today
goes for the Ruy Lopez. It's quite nice to see that he is ready to play
different openings and has good preparation in almost all lines.} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6
5. d3 d6 6. c4 (6. c3 {is the main line.}) 6... g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. Nd5 h6 (8...
O-O 9. Bg5 {is a line that Pragg had prepared.}) 9. Nb4 {The move h6 stopped
Bg5, but the drawback is that it allows Nb4.} Bd7 10. Nxc6 bxc6 (10... Bxc6 {
It's an open question as to what is better. While taking on c6 with the bishop
means that Black has more space to place his queen on d7, the remaining bishop
on the board - the g7 one is not a great one for Black.} 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. O-O
$14) 11. c5 O-O 12. O-O {In this position Pragg felt that the best way for
Black to continue would be place his knight on h5 and then break in the center
with f5. However, Batsuren had no such active plans in the game.} Re8 13. Nd2
$5 {The plan is to place the knight on a5 via c4 or b3.} d5 14. Qc2 Re6 {
The rook is not so well placed on e6. Black should have played something
active. Moves like Re6 mean that Black is ready to play the waiting game.} 15.
Nb3 Kh7 16. Bd2 Qe8 17. Rac1 {Improving his pieces!} Rd8 18. Ba5 Rc8 19. Rfe1
$5 {The rook is better placed on e1 than on f1.} Qe7 {White has maximized his
position and now it is time to come up with a plan.} 20. Qd2 $1 {Pragg's idea
is quite deep. He sees that Black has two weaknesses - one on a6 and the other
on c6. In order to attack them both, the white knight should reach b4. How
does his knight reach that square. Na1-c2-b4!} Qd8 21. Na1 {Only when
Dambasuren sees that things are becoming quite serious, does he try to do
something concrete. His idea now is Bh6.} h5 22. Nc2 $1 {A powerful decision.
It is quite reminiscent of Petrosian's exchange sacrifices, where the former
World Champion would give up his rook for a minor piece, and then continue the
game as if nothing had happened.} (22. Qb4 {is a natural move trying to save
the exchange, but Pragg doesn't cling on to his rook.}) 22... Bh6 23. Qd1 Bxc1
24. Qxc1 $44 {The resulting position might be complex, but it is easier to
play as White. The reason is that White has quite a lot of ideas in the
position to create play on the queenside. At the same time he can open things
on the kingside with f4 at an appropriate moment. On the other hand what
should Black do? It is really not so clear.} Be8 25. Bc3 Rb8 26. b4 dxe4 $6 {
A bad decision by Black as now the bishop on b3 will be a complete monster.}
27. dxe4 $16 Nd7 28. Bb3 Re7 29. Qe3 (29. f4 {Already was pretty strong, but
Pragg didn't want to get into any complications just as yet.} a5 $5 30. Rd1 $14
(30. a3 $2 Nxc5 $19)) 29... Nf6 30. h3 Ng8 31. f4 exf4 32. Qxf4 {Slowly but
steadily white pieces are getting closer to the black king!} a5 {Too late!} 33.
Nd4 axb4 (33... Rxb4 34. Nf3 $1 $18) 34. Bb2 f6 35. Nf3 Rg7 36. e5 g5 37. Qc1
g4 38. exf6 gxf3 39. fxg7 {Now Black doesn't event have a material advantage!}
Bg6 40. Re6 Qh4 41. Qe3 (41. Bc2 $18) 41... Bf5 (41... fxg2 42. Rxg6 Kxg6 43.
Qe6+ Kh7 44. Bc2+ $18) 42. Qxf3 Bxe6 43. Bc2+ Kh6 44. Qe3+ {A beautiful game
by Pragg. The idea of Qd2 followed by Na1-c2-b4 was an excellent idea. It
propelled his opponent to take some action. And when Black tried to do
something, Pragg sacrificed an exchange and won his game! What a nice game.} (
