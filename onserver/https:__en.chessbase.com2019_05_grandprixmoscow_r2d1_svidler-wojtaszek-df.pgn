1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nd7 4. O-O {We saw 4.d4 in the other Moscow of the
day- one wonders if the players were paying some kind of tribute to this king
among chess cities.} a6 ({Sometimes, Black plays} 4... Ngf6 5. Re1 {first, as
if to tempt White by making the f1-square available for the bishop. Now} a6 6.
Bf1 b6 7. d4 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bb7 {should lead to normal Sicilian stuff in most
cases, though there is also the Hedgehog-offering} 9. c4 $5 {to think about.}
e6 (9... Nxe4 10. f3 Nef6 11. Nf5 {wins the bishop-pair and recovers the pawn,
since the piece sacrifice} Ne5 12. f4 e6 13. fxe5 dxe5 14. Qxd8+ Rxd8 15. Ne3
$14 {does not inspire confidence.}) (9... Bxe4 10. Nc3 Bg6 11. Bg5 e5 12. Nd5
$16 {White simply has too much development.})) 5. Bd3 Ngf6 6. Re1 e6 (6... b5
$5 7. c4 g5 {is still considered interesting these days}) 7. a4 b6 8. c3 Bb7 9.
Na3 {White should prevent ...c4 before retreating his d3-bishop, else things
have the potential to go very wrong.} (9. Qe2 g5 $5 {is an interesting spin on
an old idea, in case White tries to prevent ...c4 by other methods.} 10. Nxg5
$6 Rg8 11. Nf3 d5 $1 12. e5 Nh5 {The point is that here Black threatens ...
Rxg2 and other associated tactics. There is amazing compensation in case of}
13. Qf1 Nf4 14. g3 Nxd3 15. Qxd3 d4 $3 $17 {and White is unable to defend
simply against even the most crude of threats like ...Qc7-c6.}) 9... Qc7 10.
Qe2 Be7 11. Bb1 {The choice of this square makes ideas like ...Ne5 or ...Bc6 a
little more appealing for Black , but otherwise there is little difference.} (
11. Bc2 O-O 12. d4 Rfc8 {is also possible.}) 11... O-O (11... Ne5 12. d4 Nxf3+
13. Qxf3 O-O 14. Qh3 $14 {doesn't look great}) (11... Bc6 12. d4 Bxa4 {is not
really a clever idea against any grandmaster; concretely here there is} 13. b3
(13. e5 dxe5 14. dxe5 Nd5 15. Bg5 h6 16. Bxe7 Kxe7 $132) 13... Bxb3 14. e5 Nd5
15. Nb5 $14 {with a huge attack.}) 12. d4 Bc6 {Intending ...Qb7, rather than
seriously thinking about taking on a4.} (12... d5 {Probably this is the best
way for Black to get an equal game.}) 13. Bd3 (13. e5 $5 Bxf3 (13... dxe5 14.
dxe5 Bxf3 15. gxf3 Nh5 (15... Nd5 {looks good, but in fact the knight doesn't
enjoy itself here after} 16. f4 g6 17. Be4 $14 {for instance}) 16. f4 g6 17.
Be4 Ra7 18. Nc4 Ng7 19. Rd1 Rd8 $14) 14. gxf3 Nd5 15. f4 g6 16. Be4 cxd4 17.
cxd4 $132 {Black faces some problems.}) 13... Qb7 (13... Bxa4 14. e5 Nd5 {
Black is not lost here (unlike, for instance, if he exchanged on e5 first-
then there'd be Qe4) but the position is unenviable.} 15. Qe4 g6 16. Bg5 $14 {
and now oddly Black will be wishing he didn't castle.}) 14. Bg5 (14. e5 {
is again a decent option.}) 14... h6 15. Bh4 cxd4 (15... Rfe8 {sets a slightly
interesting trap in the shape of} 16. Nc2 $6 b5 {and White has to pay
attention to his bishop on d3.}) 16. cxd4 {This is the only really major
decision White took in the game.} (16. Nxd4 $5 {White can be better now if
Black doesn't take on a4:} Bxa4 $1 (16... Nc5 17. Bc2 Rfd8 (17... Nxa4 18. Nc4
$18) 18. a5 $1 b5 19. b4 Ncd7 20. c4 bxc4 21. Nxc4 Rac8 22. Rab1 $14) 17. b3
Bc6 18. Bxa6 {At first, I thought this would automatically leave White better,
and of course this is true after any normal move like ...Qc7, but there is a
motif Black can use to save the day- very similar to one I once played against
Rublevsky:} Rxa6 19. Nxc6 Rfa8 $3 20. Nxe7+ Kf8 21. Bg3 $5 {The only
interesting try.} Kxe7 22. Rad1 Rxa3 23. Bxd6+ Ke8 24. e5 Ng8 $13 {The
difficulty Black faces in consolidating is considerable, but of course if he
manages, then so are the risks White faces of losing without much struggle.})
16... Rfe8 17. Nc2 a5 $6 {This move is not great and gives White good chances
of an edge again.} ({Counter-intuitively, Black should be playing} 17... b5 18.
a5 Rac8 {, a move which relies on various ...d5-based tricks in response to
Nb4. If Nb4 does not come then Black has time to reorganise, e.g.} 19. Rac1 Qb8
20. Nd2 Bb7 $11) 18. b4 $6 (18. Nd2 $14 {gives Black a few problems to solve.
White wants to simply play Bb5 at some point and convert his slight space
advantage into something even more static- the better bishop.} Nf8 19. Bg3 Ng6
20. b3) 18... Qa7 ({Black was surely tactically alert enough to spot the
possibility of} 18... axb4 $1 19. Nxb4 Bxe4 {but then he rejected it for
whatever reason. The most likely explanation is that he didn't like something
like} 20. Bxe4 d5 21. Bxd5 Nxd5 (21... exd5 22. Bxf6 Nxf6 23. Qb5 Ra5 24. Qc6
Qb8 {is also possible, with reasonable play for Black}) 22. Nxd5 Qxd5 23. Bxe7
Rxe7 $11 {because of the weakness of the b6-pawn, but in fact White's pawns
are at least equally weak and there is no way White can be better.}) 19. Nd2
Rac8 20. Bg3 {White still has his space advantage, but it's difficult to think
of good ways for him to break the tension, and meanwhile Black was probably
finally ready to think about ...d5. So White offered a draw- the shortest and
maybe least eventful of the day, but still with its talking-points.} 1/2-1/2
