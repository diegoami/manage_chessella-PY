{While playing this game, I was on 2.0/3. I had already drawn with two players
who were rated lower than me and I wanted to win this game at all costs, even
though I was Black. The opening had gone pretty well for me and I had
equalized without too many difficulties. Hence, I wasn't quite happy with this
position. White's defensive task is not so difficult. In fact I do not see why
I should be better here. My next move was a small trap into which my opponent
fell.} 38... a4 $5 {[%cal Ga5a4] Andreea was playing pretty fast. Hence, even
though it was the 40th move, she had a lot of time. But I think she had lost
her sense of danger at this point and simply captured the pawn.} 39. bxa4 $2 (
39. Bc4 {According to me was the easiest way to equalize.} Nb6 {I had planned
this and after} 40. Re3+ Kf6 41. Bb5 $1 axb3 42. Rxb3 $11 {I think White has
absolutely no problems. In fact Black has to be careful not to over press.}) (
39. Bc2 {was also possible.}) 39... Kd4 $1 {My king comes in now and White has
no Bishop to c4 eliminating my strong knight.} 40. Bc2 (40. Bb5 c4 {Also
looked pretty strong. But maybe was better because the bishop blocks the
b-file and Black cannot penetrate so easily.}) 40... c4 $1 {[%cal Gc4b3,Gc4d3,
Yd5e3,Yd5c3,Yd5f4] Look at the knight, king and the pawn combo. They stop the
white rook from getting activated. Each and every square is covered!} 41. Kd2
Re6 42. Bd1 Rb6 43. Kc2 (43. Bc2 Rb2 {At some point I have to go in and it is
similar to the game.}) 43... c3 {This was a committal move, but I saw that
this was the only way forward.} 44. a5 (44. Rd3+ {I wasn't particularly
worried about this check.} Kc4 45. Be2 $2 {This fails tactically.} (45. Rf3
Rb2+ 46. Kc1 Ra2 {is like the game.}) 45... Rb2+ 46. Kd1 Rxe2 47. Kxe2 c2 $19)
44... Rb2+ 45. Kc1 {Now Black has everything under control, but White is
pushing her a-pawn down the board. Hence it was important to play Ra2 and
eliminate those pawns. But first it was important to stop Bb3 when Ra2 is
played.} Kc4 $1 (45... Ra2 46. Bb3 Rxa3 47. Bxd5 Kxd5 48. Kc2 $11) 46. a6 Ra2

lines are always nice.} c2+ 51. Kb2 Ra2+ 52. Kb3 c1=N+ 53. Kc3 Rc2#) 49... Kd4
(49... Nb4 {was the best way to win. I didn't want her to activate her rook
and hence avoided this line, but concretely it just wins.} 50. Bc2 Nxa6 $1 51.
Rf4 Nb4 $19 {The rook is not getting activated yet and Black is just winning.})
50. Be2 Ke4 {The rook cannot move, nor can the bishop. Hence the king has to.}
51. Kc1 (51. Kc2 Nb4+ $19) 51... Ra1+ 52. Kc2 Ra2+ 53. Kd1 {This was the
crucial moment of the game. I saw the lines that I could not take on e2 just
yet. And I also felt that Rxa6 complicated the winning task to some extent.
Hence, I decided to maintain control. But it was wrong. Instead I should have
understood that if I got this same position with White to move, I would be
simply winning. Hence it was necessary to lose a move here.} Rd2+ $2 (53...
Rxe2 $2 {This looks winning but actually throws away the win.} 54. Kxe2 c2 55.

way to win here.} Ke5 $11 (57... Nd5 $2 {would even lead to bad position for
Black.} 58. Qe8+ Kd4 59. Qh8+ Ke4 $2 (59... Nf6 60. Qxf6+ $16) 60. f3# {
what a mate!})) (53... Ra4 $1 {Just a waiting move. The idea as mentioned
before is to lose a move.} 54. Kc2 (54. Kc1 Ra3 55. Kd1 Ra2 $19 {This is the
position that we want to reach.}) 54... Ra1 $1 55. Kb3 Rb1+ 56. Kc2 (56. Kc4 c2
$19) 56... Rb2+ 57. Kd1 Ra2 $22 {And there we have it White to play and there
is no move available.}) (53... Rxa6 $1 {was also winning, but some faith was
required that the bishop versus pawns endgame was winning.} 54. Bxa6 Kxf3 55.

effort.}) 56. Bxd5 Kxg3 57. Bf7 Kxh4 58. Bxg6 f4 59. Ke2 Kg4 $19 {These three
pawns are too much for White to handle. Black wins. Somehow during the game I
was not ready to leave my control and go into such a transformation.}) 54. Ke1
Rd4 {I thought I was being quite smart as now White has no move but to push
the pawn and then Ra4 wins it. But I missed my opponent's smart defence.} (
54... Ra2 55. Bc4 $1 {White holds the draw.}) 55. a7 Ra4 56. Rd3 $2 (56. Bc4 $1

aspirations.}) 56... Rxa7 {Now things are back on track.} 57. f3+ Ke5 58. Bd1

Bc2 Ne3 $2 {It's very important to understand why this is a question-mark move. It's not
easy to understand on the surface. We have to dig deeper and you will realize
it as we make more moves.} (60... Nb4 $1 {was a nice way to win as after} 61.
Rxc3+ Kd4 $1 {A key move.} 62. Rc8 Ke3 $19 {Black king infiltrates and wins
all the pawns.}) 61. Rxc3+ Nxc2+ 62. Rxc2 Rxg3 {I had seen all of this and
thought that winning two pawns would naturally end the game.} 63. Kf2 Rf3+ 64.
Kg2 Rxf4 {And here my opponent resigned. And it seemed like the right move.
After all, she was two pawns down and Black had everything in order.
Surprisingly, and much to my disbelief this position turns out to be a draw.}
