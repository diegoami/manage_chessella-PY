likely drawn.}) 40. bxc5 Ne8 {I'm not sure why the game ended here. Possibly
Jaan lost on time, or maybe he just didn't bother to continue because the
match had already been decided in our favor. Either way this game makes it the
second time in two tries John Emms beats our guy. We better watch out in 2020!}
