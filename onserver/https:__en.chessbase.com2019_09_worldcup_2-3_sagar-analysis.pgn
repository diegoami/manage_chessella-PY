overstretched.} Bd6 {128} 14. Re1 {8} Re8 $5 {78 A very interesting move and
not the first move that comes to mind. Usually you want to connect your rooks
with Qd7 and then challenge on the open file. But it turns out that ...Re8 is
a pretty good move.} (14... Qd7 $5) 15. g4 {257 Somehow it felt like White was

found by Eltaj.} Bxe5 {12} 29. Nxe5 {1 After this Black is in trouble from
multiple fronts. His back rank is slightly weak. The knight on e5 is solidly
placed with f4 coming up. The pawns on a-file are weak and the c pawn is
