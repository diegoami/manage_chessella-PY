{You cannot play this sort of chess if you have a weak stomach, so big respect
for both players, particularly to Hesham. Since he lives far away from the
tournament hall and due to the Egyptian madhouse on the streets called traffic,
Hesham was quite often very late at his board, usually with only 31 or 32 min
left on his clock for the whole game. Just in time before getting defaulted!!
In the final round though he was punctual, so probably he slept somewhere
nearby. And yet, Moheb was a tough egg to crack...} 14. Nxd5 $1 exd5 15. exd5
O-O 16. Nf5 Bd6 17. Be3 {White decided to develop his pieces, preparing an
attack but playing positional chess could have been more precise.} (17. Nxd6
Qxd6 18. b3 Rc8 19. Ba3 Qf4 20. c4 {The pawns will prove not only dangerous but
rather difficult to stop without material loses.}) 17... Nbd7 18. Qd2 Rfe8 19.
c4 Bf8 20. Rac1 a5 {A very logical move, looking for a blockade, but apparently
not the best according to these machines.} (20... Ne4 {is more precise,
disturbing White's coordination} 21. Qc2 Ndf6 $13) 21. Red1 { returning the
favour} ({Better was} 21. c5 {when the pawn cannot be captured} Bxc5 22. Bxc5

interesting to analyze this position in depth as there are alternatives at
every turn.} 26. Nxg7 $1 {The second piece is sacrificed for a higher cause and
it almost paid off...} Kxg7 27. Qf5 Qg6 28. Bxe5+ Kg8 29. Rd1 Qxf5 30. Rxf5 Bc8
31. Rh5 Ra6 32. d6 Bd7 33. Rd5 {White's advantages goes down and lower.} (33.

{the final mistake missing an intermediate move.} (36. Rd4 Rg6 37. Rg4 {White
still holds the trumps but Black has some sort of blockade} Bd7) 36... Nxd7 37.
Be4+ Rg6+ {Oups!} 38. Kh2 Bxd5 {An important victory for Hesham, who finished
on the 2nd place with 7.5/9. Well done!} 0-1
