28. Bxd7 Bxb4 29. Ra4 Bc5 $1 {An excellent defensive move by Adams. He realises
that his fortress like position with bishop on c5 and pawn on b6 will be
extremely difficult to breach.} 30. Rxc4 b6 31. Kg2 g6 32. Bc6 Ne8 33. Rd7 (
33. Bxe8 {Later Carlsen felt that he should have taken this knight.} Rxe8 34.
Rd7 {This might give White more chances to win than in the game, but the truth
would be that the position is closer to Black drawing than White winning.})

{Nakamura in the commentary room said that he liked this setup already for
Black and that it was dififcult to breakthrough. Mickey however decides that
the best place for his knight is on d6.} Nc6 40. Ra8 Nb4 41. Bc4 Nc6 42. f4 Ne7

69. Rb6 $16 {might have given some chances to White, although it doesn't seem
like anything serious.}) 67... Kd7 68. f5 Be3 $1 69. Rg7 (69. g6 Nh6+ $11)

agreed to a draw and didn't test his opponent for a few more moves! Great
fighting spirit shown by the World Champion and great defensive play by Michael
Adams.} 1/2-1/2
