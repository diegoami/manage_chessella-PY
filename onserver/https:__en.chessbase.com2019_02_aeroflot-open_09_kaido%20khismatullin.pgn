d5 $5 {Kulaots - "This 26…d5 exd5 and 27…♝c7 by Khismatullin was an
excellent clearance motif, setting up all sorts of things happening on White's
back rank. Denis must have been well aware that in case he chooses a slower
continuation, then White´s next moves will be ♔f1, ♘g1-f3. If White
achieves this, he will feel himself very safe. And this, let's agree, is not
that little at all in this kind of tournament situation. So in practical terms
his choice was really unpleasant for me."} 27. exd5 Bc7 28. a6 {Kulaots - "I
think that 28.a6 was one of my most important decision of the tournament."}

as such."} Qf2 42. Qe8+ Kh7 43. Qxf7 Qxc2 44. Qxa7 Qxb3 45. Qxc5 Qb8 46. Kg3 {
Kaido - "First of all, by our century it is well known that theoretically
speaking h+g is under regular circumstances is not winning in queen ending as
recently also my team māte Eduardas Rozentalis demonstrated in Bundesliga
against Jonny Hector. And secondly, as everybody could relearn from Anish
Giri´s tweet, there was a recent game between Vidit Gujrathi and Erwin l'Ami,
where this very 3 vs 1 occured and that ended in a draw. And thirdly, I very
well remembered a queen ending of myself from Estonian championship 22 years
ago, when after good seven hours of play I was approaching the promotion of my
passed extra pawn in queen ending and with it the victory over so far
inconvenient opponent for me, Sergei Zjukin. Only to be mated by one long
queen move. I really did not want to face anything similar again, so I forced
myself to stay focused until the very last move."} Qd8 47. Qh5+ Kg8 48. Qe5 Kh7
