1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O d6 6. c3 Nxe4 {This is a pet
line of Rapport's. It has a reputation of being slightly dubious, but in this
game Rapport shows that Black's position is full of resources.} (6... Bd7 {
is the most common move, and one which I have successfully played myself.}) 7.
d4 Bd7 8. Re1 Nf6 9. Bxc6 Bxc6 10. dxe5 dxe5 11. Qxd8+ Kxd8 12. Nxe5 Be8 {
The previous moves are all logical and quite forcing. Indeed, this has all
been seen before in a game of Rapport's.} 13. Bg5 h6 14. Bxf6+ {White shatters
Black's pawn structure at the cost of the bishop pair.} gxf6 15. Ng4 Be7 16.
Nd2 $146 {Blitzed out by Nepomniachtchi.} (16. Na3 {was seen in
Friedel-Rapport, Reykjavik 2018.}) 16... Bd7 17. Ne3 Be6 18. Nb3 Kc8 19. Nd4
Bd7 20. Rad1 a5 $1 {[%cal Ga8a6,Ga5a4] Intending to gain space on the
queenside while potentially activating the rook via a6.} 21. Nd5 Bd8 {Black's
pieces are very passive, but this seems to be a purely temporary state of
affairs. At this point Nepomniachtchi sank into thought but failed to come up
with a productive plan. Indeed, engines initially prefer White by a large
margin but after deep analysis they, too, realise that Black's position is
simply too solid.} 22. Nb3 (22. Ne7+ Kb8 {leads nowhere for White. For example:
} 23. Nb3 Be6 24. Ng6 Rg8 25. Nf4 Bg4 26. Rd4 a4 27. Nc5 Ra5 $1 $11 {and
Black's pieces are springing into life.}) 22... b6 23. Nd4 a4 24. c4 Ra5 25. f4
c6 26. Nc3 Re8 27. Rxe8 Bxe8 28. Kf2 Bd7 29. Rd3 Bc7 30. Kf3 Rc5 {A slightly
odd decision. Black's rook is poorly placed here.} (30... f5 $11) 31. b3 axb3
32. axb3 f5 33. Re3 Kd8 34. Nd1 b5 35. Rd3 (35. Nc3 {would initiate a short
tactical skirmish, but with accurate play Black should be fine:} Ba5 $1 (35...
bxc4 $2 36. b4 {traps the rook.}) 36. Nc2 Be6 $1 (36... Bxc3 37. Rxc3 $14 {
would give White hopes of exploiting a 'good knight vs bad bishop' scenario.})
37. b4 Rxc4 $1 38. bxa5 b4 39. Nxb4 Rxb4 $11 {and the game should end in a
draw.}) 35... bxc4 36. bxc4 Rxc4 37. Ne3 Ra4 $1 {keeping an eye on the f4-pawn.
} 38. Nxc6+ {With pawns limited to one side of the board, there is not much
left to play for. Impressive composure from Rapport, who showed that his pet
line is certainly playable.} 1/2-1/2
