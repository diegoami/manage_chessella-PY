create complicated and agressive positions, as we will see in the game!} e5 7.

keeping the bishop is another way to play this} 10. exd5 Bf5 11. Qd2 {

better}) 16... Nf6 17. g3 Ng4 18. c3 Bf6 (18... Be8 $1 $15 {would be very
annoying, threatening to take and play a4. If I take on e8, then I have
problems controlling the queen-side properly (Rxe8! and Qc7 with Qc4 ideas)})

the first time by Alexander Khalifman in the round of 16 of the FIDE World
Championship back in 1999, against one of the world's best Najdorf specialists
- Boris Gelfand. Khalifman used it with success and went on to win the
tournament!} Nc5 13. Nxc5 dxc5 14. O-O-O e4 15. Qd2 Bd6 16. g5 Nd7 17. h4 Ne5

expand the queenside. In the other hand, white obtains a strong passed pawn on
d5, and a perfect scenario to play with c4 and g4!, castling queen-side} ({ a
similar precedent was:} 12... Rc8 13. a5 Nc5 14. Nxc5 dxc5 15. c4 e4 16. Qc2

a good move.}) 13. Nxc5 dxc5 14. c4 Qc7 15. Qc2 Rae8 $6 (15... e4 { perhaps
should be better, because if White plays the same g4 now, then Black may decide
where to place the a8-rook}) 16. g4 $1 $16 {a good moment to play this move,
because Black already removed the rook from a8, meaning White will have more
freedom do castle queen-side. Also, Black will never be able to expand with f5
anymore, as it usually happens in this pawn structure. White definitely won the
opening battle here and has a good advantage} e4 {this had to be played sooner
or later} 17. O-O-O Bd6 18. g5 Nd7 19. Kb1 Ne5 20. h4 $1 ( 20. Qxe4 $6 {there
is no need to take this pawn, as it helps Black} Nc6 $5 $44 {followed by Nb4.

Black only starts the counterplay on the queen-side after white decides to take
on f3 (something he will do whenever he wants)} Qd7 ( 21... f6 {is the
computer's suggestion, and does not solve all the problems} 22. Bxf3 exf3 23.

and at the same time watching the passed 'd' pawn, Bg5 is coming next}) 22. a5

hanging} Qc7 23. Bxf3 exf3 24. Bd2 $1 Re2 $2 25. h6 g6 26. Qc3 $18 {followed by

better} 22. Rhh1 Qe7 (22... f5 23. gxf6 Rxf6 24. h5 $16 {also looks good for

draw this very difficult game. In the post-game interview Eljanov said that
after 34.Rxe5 Qxe5 35.d6, it was already hopeless for Black, meaning he also
did not realize that Black is not losing the rook endgame, which is totally
understandable.} (37... Qxc3 $1 38. bxc3 Rd8 {it was very hard to understand
