{Tiger has the reputation of fighting like a beast, particularly in crazy
positions, where his strengths are even more visible. This tournament was not
meant to be, as coaching on site the talented local children can be motivating
but exhausting too. Furthermore, facing Mark's deadliest weapons, the King's
Indian, was not a picnic.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6.

of such moves, re-grouping and re-routing. Tiger fought like a tiger but Mark's
experience in the KID proved too much. Shall we count on a DVD Mark?? I am a
KID player too and you will have the first customer!} 21. Qc2 Ng4 22. Bxg4 Bxg4
