enforce b4 with the move Rb1, Caruana went for a3. But this move has a deeper
point which is to use the safer square a2 to lift the rook rather than the b2
square.} c5 12. dxc5 bxc5 13. Ne5 Bb7 14. Bf4 Nbd7 (14... Bf8 {was played by
Karjakin against Topalov, and when Topalov had responded with Rb2, the bishop
came back to d6 as in many lines the rook was hanging on b2. Here Caruana can
avoid all of that with the move Ra2!} 15. Ra2 $1 Bd6 $2 16. Nxd5 $1 $18) 15.

the best, but to prove an advantage against it is not an easy task.} ({Better

manoeuvre Be5-d4 and hence took with this rook. But this means that the a7 pawn
falls.} (22... Rexd8 23. Bc7 Rdc8 24. Bxb6 axb6 25. Rxa8 Rxa8 26. Bxd5 $16 )
23. Rxa7 Nc4 {This is critical for assessing the quality of Karjakin's
sacrifice. It must be said that over the board this position is not so easy to
win for White. Black hardly has any weaknesses. The pawns are all on one side,
which greatly reduces White's chances. Caruana tried hard but couldn't crack
through Karjakin's defences.} 24. h3 Bh5 25. Bg5 Bg6 26. Bxf6 gxf6 27. g4 Kg7

capabilities are truly fantastic.} 29. Qxc4 d3 30. g5 {This looks like the most
natural way to force events, but better could have been} (30. Kh2 d2 31. Bf3

is a different question, but he has some chances.}) 30... d2 (30... fxg5 $2 31.
