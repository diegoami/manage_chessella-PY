Bxd1 (12... Qf5 13. Nef3 {was seen recently in Raghunandan vs Sanal which was
analyzed on ChessBase India. Hari chooses to simplify. As the game progressed,
this decision does seem dubious.}) 13. Nxd3 Bxb3 14. axb3 (14. Nxc5 {is also a
move that has to be considered.} Bd5 15. Nxb7 $5 $16) 14... Be7 15. b4 a6 16.
Ne4 {White has his pieces better centralized looking at the c5 square and
Black has to be very careful not to land into a passive position.} Nd7 17. Bf4
Rac8 18. Rad1 {Beautiful centralization!} Rfd8 19. g4 {The king is the last
piece that needs to be improved!} Bf8 20. Kg2 $1 {The sign of a classy player.}
