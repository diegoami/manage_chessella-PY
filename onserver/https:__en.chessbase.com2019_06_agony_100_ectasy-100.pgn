It shouldn't come as a great surprise that a man who upheld the Lativan Gambit
for years aslo likes to play the King's Gambit as White.} exf4 3. Bc4 h6 $6 {
This prepares ...g5, but that is much more effective when White is committed
to Nf3 so that g4 will hit it. Instead, Black has tried numerous other moves,
incuding} (3... Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 {which is most common}) (3... Qh4+ 4. Kf1 d6 5.

attacking game by Guy in which his opponent was totally bamboozled by the
ancient King's Gambit. Bxf7+ was nice, and I particularly like how Guy ignored
the far-flung knight on h1 and even let it escape as he persued the main aim
of attacking.} 1-0

reacted vigorously to his opponent's opening with a critical line and gained
the advantage when Black failed to force the exchange of queens.  He changed
gear at exactly the right moment with Qd5!, forcing the queens off when Black
was unable to react properly. While there were some chances for Black to
resist afterwards they were hard to play, and against less tough defence Guy
was ruthless.} 1-0
