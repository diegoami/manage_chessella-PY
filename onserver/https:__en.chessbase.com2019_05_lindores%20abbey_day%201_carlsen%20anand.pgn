many ways to fight for an advantage here. The anti-intuitive ...c4 is strong.
It does weaken the d4 square, but that is not the most important thing in the
position. The c5 pawn will no longer be weak and e3 pawn is always in trouble.}
d4 $2 {A big oversight by Vishy who clearly missed Magnus' next move.} 20. Na4
$1 {Now the c5 pawn is falling, Qb3 is coming up, All in all this looks bad
for Black. But objectively the position is just equal. However, the tide has
changed, and that's the reason why even though the position is equal, Magnus'
body language changed and so did Vishy's. It felt from Anand's expressions
that he had almost lost the game.} Nd7 $6 (20... Qe7 $1 21. Nxc5 dxe3 $11) 21.
