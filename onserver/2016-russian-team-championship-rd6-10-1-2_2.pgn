34... c3 ({According to the engines} 34... f5 $1 {was best here though White
would maintain an edge. Above all, this would evict the bishop from its e4
perch where it threatens a natural catastrophe on a8 (i.e. an unstoppable
a-pawn).}) 35. a6 Bc4 36. a4 $1 ({No doubt, Black was hoping (expecting) for}
36. Ra5 Bxa6 37. Rxa6 c2 38. Bxc2 Rxc2 39. a4 {and though White stands better,
nothing is decided.}) 36... Rc7 {An unpleasant reality.} (36... Bxb5 {just
loses after} 37. axb5 c2 38. Bxc2 Rxc2 39. b6 {and one of the pawns will make
it to the finish line.}) 37. Rb7 Rc8 38. a7 Bd5 39. Rb8 1-0
