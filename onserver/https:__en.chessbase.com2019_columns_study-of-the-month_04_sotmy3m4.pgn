{As a young composer, it was a great honor to work together with Iuri Akobia,
but this remained also our only cooperation. In this memorial tourney for the
Siberian chess composer Konstantin Sukharev the study received the fourth
prize. Akobia's many co-authorships were rewarding, as four of the five
studies of this month's selection were co-authored. The many solo studies of
Akobia are underrepresented here, as they are often more difficult for
"laymen". So White is to move and win, utilizing his rooks.} 1. dxe7 Nd6 ({The

{This study shows what is possible with the "Georgian material". There are
mostly two kinds of studies with the material - theoretical and artistic ones.
This one clearly is of the artistic category, and it is not easy at all to see
that eventually Pf2 will end on b7 as a blocker to allow White to checkmate.
How? Of course by promoting into a knight first. The ending is reminiscent to
a famous Selezniev study, in itself an expansion of a Weenink idea. White to
move and win.} 1. Rc7 $1 {Black has strong threats, so White must threaten

White must avoid getting in zugzwang. Here choosing any other square would
mean that Black chooses the correspoding square so that White must undefend
either f1 or a square on c8-h3 where the bishop can move to. As the squares
directly correspond, the situations are all of a mutual zugzwang, i.e. White
to move would lose and Black to move can only draw. The bishop and rook both
must attack/defend the both squares (f1 and any on c8-h3).} (11. Rf7 $2 Bb5 $1

{As I often try, we end with a fun study. It is long, showing a repeating
manoeuver, but it is very interesting to see that White actually can win. The
American co-author, Richard Becker, is known for longer studies, i.e. 15+
moves, but sadly often much analysis is needed. This and the previous study
are pleasant exceptions. The solution does not need much explanation as much
repeats, so annotation and comment is given as needed. However, this is a real
"study" in the word sense, as one needs to look at the positions prior to each
move to see the obvious reasons for the way White plays - and also at the
entire picture to see why White has only one winning plan that is far from
obvious, making this a good study to replay but a potentially very bad one for
solving. White to move and win.} 1. Rh8+ $1 Kc7 2. Rh7+ $1 (2. Qg7+ $2 Kc6 $1

White has set up the crucial position that will repeat. For now White must
make a3 available to the queen from f3 and remove also Pa4 by sacrificing the
exchange. In the materially equal pawnless endgame, the repeating manoeuver
plays out. It is of note that the endgame needs almost all of the 50 moves
allocated to win in a game, but in a study this restriction does not hold up
and it would also count as a win if more than 50 pawnless moves were required
until the next capture or checkmate.} 6. Rxa4+ Bxa4 7. Qxa4+ Ra6 ({White is
