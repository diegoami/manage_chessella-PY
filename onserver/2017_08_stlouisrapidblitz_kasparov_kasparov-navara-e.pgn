{[#]} 33... Ke8 {From the opening Kasparov outplayed Navara completely and now
has several ways to convert.} 34. Nd3 $6 (34. e6 $1 {is the clearest way to
win, e.g.:} Rf1 35. c6 Rc1+ 36. Kd4 Rxc6 37. e7 {and White will mate. The
black rook is Black's only more or less active piece but the rook alone is
helpless against White's plans:} Rc1 38. Kd5 Rd1+ 39. Kc6 Rc1+ 40. Kd6 Rd1+ 41.

the bishop and complicates the position.}) 36. c6 Rxh2+ 37. Ke3 $2 {A mistake
that is hard to understand: Kasparov allows Navara to put his rook behind the
c-pawn. And then it is difficult for White to make progess.} (37. Kc3 $18 {
