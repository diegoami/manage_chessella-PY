10. Qe2 O-O 11. f4 Bxd4 12. Bxd4 Nxd4 13. Rxd4 e5 {Up until now it has all
been seen before. Caruana chose Rd1 and it seems a natural move apart from the
fact that it loses a pawn! That is the way with supergrandmasters, they can
see beyond the "I lose a pawn" feeling you have as you look at a position.} 14.
Rd1 {The novelty menioned in the last post. I know everyone will say it is an
obvious pawn sacrifice but it has not been played before and it is not the
first choice of the chess engines.} exf4 15. e5 {fixing the d-pawn as well.} f3
16. Qxf3 Qxe5 17. Bg2 {Black may be a pawn up but I guarantee you that
Movsesian was immediately looking for a way to give the pawn back for an equal
position. The problem is that it is not easy!} d6 18. Rhe1 Qg5+ 19. Kb1 Be6 {

to miss it here!","","","d1e1","",10]} 27. Rde1 Qb5 28. Qe5 {White is a full
pawn up with a 3 vs 1 majority on the queenside which is much easier to win in
an ending than if one of the White queenside pawns was an f-pawn.} Qc6 29. b3
