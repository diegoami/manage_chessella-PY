c6 9. a4 b6 10. Bg5 {The first new move although the position is still equal.
Bachmann is playing slightly provocatively since he is black versus a lower
rated player.} Bb7 11. Re1 Nbd7 12. Qd2 Rc8 13. Bf1 Re8 14. Rad1 {White has
kept his space advantage but played rather modestly. It is hard for Black to
make progress as both sides have improved their pieces as much as possible.
Now the GM from Paraguay begins direct action.} cxd5 15. exd5 Rc5 {The white d
pawn is surrounded, white has to came up with some concrete solution to the
threat of taking on d5 or the 2641 Bachmann will take over the initiative.} 16.
Nd4 $1 {Excellent move which required Illingworth to see what to do after the
capture of the d-pawn.} a6 (16... Nxd5 $6 17. Ne4 $1 {[%cal Ge4d6,Ge4c5]}) 17.

choices. Can you make the right one?","","","d4c6","",10]} 18. Nc6 $1 Rxc6 19.
dxc6 Bxc6 20. Bxa6 {The position has clarified to a large advantage for White.
At some stage the white a-pawn will cause Black great pain! Bachmann tries to
find a tactical solution and give White chances to go wrong.} Bxg2 $5 21. Kxg2
