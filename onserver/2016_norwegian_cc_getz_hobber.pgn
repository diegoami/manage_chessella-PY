18. Rxd7 $1 {Maybe objectivley not the best, but a great idea which reminded
me of the great game between Keres and Szabo from Budapest in 1955. White
sacrifices the exchange to remove a vital defender. Although black still
should be able to defend, his task is not easy at all.} Bxd7 19. Qg4 Bc6 20.
Bg5 Qc8 21. Nh5 $1 {Nicolai sees the opportunity to throve the knight into the
attack.} Qd8 (21... gxh5 22. Bxh7+ Kxh7 23. Qxh5+ Kg8 24. Bf6 Bxf6 25. exf6 Re7
