Rgg7 35. Ra3 Kg8 36. Bf2 Kh8 37. Be1 Rg8 38. Bf2 Reg7 39. Rh3 Qa6 {Black has
obtained what must be a strategically winning position. All of his pieces are
better and White's structure is shattered. And yet Eljanov has been unable to
find a way in, and it is not easy to find at all. Karjakin, however, cracks
under pressure.} 40. Qd1 $2 Ng4+ $1 {It seems silly to give up this knight, but
Black gets to take all the pawns.} 41. Bxg4 fxg4 42. Rh1 Qxc4 43. Qe2 Qxd5 {Two
pawns are two pawns.} 44. Rd1 Qe6 45. c4 Rd7 46. Rd5 Bf7 47. Be1 Qe8 48. Rf5
Kh7 49. Bc3 Be6 50. Rf6 Rf7 51. Rg6 {Trying to create complications, Karjakin
gives away yet another pawn.} Rxg6 52. hxg6+ Kxg6 53. Ra1 h5 54. Rd1 Rd7 55.
Qh2 Qd8 $2 (55... Bxc4 56. Qh4 Qd8 57. f5+ Kxf5 58. Qxh5+ Qg5+ 59. Qxg5+ Kxg5
{is just winning for Black, but it is easy to be scared of ghosts.}) 56. Ba1 d5
$2 {This move is hard to understand. He should simply take the free pawn when
he can.} (56... Bxc4 57. Qb2 {i guess this was the point of ba1, but it comes
with no threat at all.} d5 58. Qe5 d4+ $19) 57. cxd5 Rxd5 58. Qb2 Rd3+ 59. Ke2
Qd4 60. Qxd4 cxd4 61. Rxd3 Bc4 62. Bxd4 exd3+ 63. Ke3 {Opposite colored bishop
endgames aren't easy, but luckily for Eljanov this one is winning.} Kf5 64. Bc3

$19) 68... Be8 69. Kd5 b5 {and this is just over. White will eventually have to
bring back the king and let the Black king in, or he will have to bring back
the bishop after which h4 is a lethal breakthrough in the kingside.}) 66. Bc3
Kf5 67. Be1 Kf6 68. Bd2 Kg6 69. Bc3 Kf5 $4 {Trying to gain time, Eljanov misses
the fact that this is a three-fold repetition. Karjakin correctly claimed it
and won the match.} 1/2-1/2
