1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Nd7 4. d4 Ngf6 5. e5 (5. Nc3 {is the main move, but
Jolanta goes for something much sharper.}) 5... cxd4 $5 6. exf6 Qa5+ 7. c3 Qxb5
8. fxe7 Bxe7 9. Nxd4 Qe5+ (9... Qa6 $5) 10. Be3 O-O 11. Nd2 f5 12. O-O f4 13.
N4f3 Qf5 14. Bd4 g5 $6 {This seems like a premature sign of activity. Black is
not fully developed and the move g5 weakens his position.} 15. Re1 Rf7 16. Nc4
(16. Qb3 $1 {Building up future pressure would have been srong.} Kf8 17. Ne4 g4
18. Nfg5 $1 Bxg5 19. Nxd6 $18) 16... Nf8 17. Rxe7 $5 {A very interesting
exchange sacrifice for long term compensation.} Rxe7 18. Nxd6 Qd5 19. Bf6 Qxd1+
20. Rxd1 Re2 {Here White has good compensation, but after the exchange of
queens, Black can breathe a tad easy. At least his king won't be easily mated.}
21. Nxg5 h6 22. Ngf7 Be6 23. Nxh6+ Kh7 24. Nhf5 Bxf5 25. Nxf5 Rae8 {By giving
up a few pawns, Black has activated his forces. Now White has three pawns for
an exchange, but the rooks are tremendously active and it is difficult for
White to keep control.} 26. Kf1 Rxb2 (26... Kg6 $5 27. Nd6 Kxf6 28. Nxe8+ Rxe8

fighting spirit shown by Jolanta.} Rc6 (41... Rf8 $5 $17) 42. Nh6+ Kh7 43. Rf7+
Kg6 44. f5+ (44. Rxe7 Rxe7 45. Bxe7 Kxh6 $19) 44... Nxf5 45. Rxf5 {White has
won a piece, but the queenside pawns are just too strong and quick.
Objectively it is still equal, but White's task is very difficult, while all
that Black has to do is keep pushing the pawns.} a4 46. Bf4 $6 (46. h5+ $1 Kxh5
47. Bd2+ Kg6 48. Rg5+ Kh7 49. Ng4 $11 {And somehow White has managed to
co-ordinate his forces in a way that perpetual checks are possible through
h5-g5-f5.}) 46... Rf6 $1 47. h5+ Kg7 48. Rg5+ Kh7 49. Rg4 a3 50. Bc1 a2 51. Bb2
Rb6 52. Bd4 Kxh6 {A fighting game of chess won by Jakubowski.} 0-1
