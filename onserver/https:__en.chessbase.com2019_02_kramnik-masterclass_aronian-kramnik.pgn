1. e4 {A surprise on the very first move. I suspected that in this tournament
overwhelmingly closed openings would be played against me. And least of all
did I expect 1.e4 in my game against Aronian.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 {
In our earlier encounters with 1.e4 played by Levon we continued into the main
line of the Berlin Defence, but without much success – all these games ended
as draws.} Bc5 5. Bxc6 dxc6 {I do not know for what reasons Levon selected
this variation. It is all the more difficult to understand because he never
again played 1.e4 in this tournament. He certainly had his reasons for this,
but his decision seemed somewhat strange to me. On the other hand, if it had
been justified it would have been called correct, far-sighted, etc.} 6. O-O {
Such a treatment of the opening has always seemed dubious to me. Even after 3..
.a6 the exchange on c6 is not considered dangerous for Black - and in the
variation from our game White is playing free of any compulsion... It is clear
to me that this line is very prevalent in practice and contains some
subtleties, but I will never be able to believe that by playing like this
White can lay claim to an opening advantage. Naturally in today's theory many
variations have been analysed all the way to a draw, so that one feels the
desire to deviate at some point and simply "play chess", but in concrete terms
here White has, in my opinion, absolutely no preconditions for even a minimal
advantage and with my classical chess education I cannot take this variation
seriously. For that reason, moreover, I have also lost some games in this line;
on the other hand, not a few of them ended in a win for me.} Qe7 {There are
various possibilities for Black here, but I have often played and analysed
such positions and come to the conclusion that this queen move is very
interesting. If White delays h2-h3, then Black also holds back with the move
Nf6-d7 and first develops his bishop. For example: 7.Nbd2 Bg4 8.h3 Bh5 9.Nc4
Nd7 – in my opinion this is an ideal setup for Black, in which he has hardly
any problems.} 7. h3 {I analysed this variation 10 years ago, then 7, then a
few years ago – and each time something new revealed itself to me. Of course
Black can simply castle – that is not really linked to any danger and should
suffice for equality. But at some point I hit on the idea of punishing White
for the move h2-h3 and started to analyse 7...h6 with the idea of attacking
with g5-g4. For his part, White then begins with c3, d4 to play in the centre;
I found no advantage for him, and sharp and complicated positions appear on
the board.} {Not that I would be dissatisfied with that, but when I cam back
to this variation a few years ago, Nicht, dass ich damit unzufrieden wäre,
aber als ich vor ein paar Jahren zu dieser Variante wieder zurückkehrte, hat
sich etwa als fünfter Computerzug...} Rg8 $1 {...had appeared as something
like the fifth computer move (today's engines award it first or second place
in their list of priorities). I thought about this and understood that
although this continuation looks absurd at first glance, it makes perfect
sense: Black will save a tempo. On further investigation it became clear to me
that it is simply the "refutation" of White's whole system. After g7-g5 this
pawn must not be taken under any circumstances, because Black then quickly
obtains a mating attack. But even if White allows the opposing g-pawn to
survive, Black pre-empts White with his threats – White's play in the centre
is too late. I cannot say whether at that time I went into the position very
deeply: Black was standing so well everywhere that I could not believe that I
would ever meet the line in practice, though if I did – then in any case it
is wonderful to get such a position. I did not go through the relevant
variations in my preparation for the game against Aronian (as I said, I
certainly wasn't expecting him to play 1.e4) and had almost nothing ready
after 7...Rg8. Moreover, when I re-opened my earlier notes after the game I
established that I had not written much at all about it.} 8. Kh1 {I could
still remember that this is the best and practically the only move. If White
does not play it he immediately gets a worse position. Levon took this in no
way obvious decision very quickly. So far I have not yet talked to him on this
subject, so I do not know if he had previously had a look at this variation,
but could not believe the power of 7...Rg8, or whether he did not want to show
that he was not prepared for this line.} Nh5 $5 ({At the board I could still
remember that I had previously analysed} 8... h6 {here. After the game I
established that I had then even somewhat preferred it over 8...Nh5. A modern
computer shows the following variation:} 9. Nbd2 g5 10. Nc4 g4 11. Nfxe5 h5 {
(a cold blooded attack)} 12. d4 Bd6 13. Re1 gxh3 {and White is still hanging
on, the evaluation is approximately "=/+". But I preferred the knight move
which appeared to be ambitious and principled. From this point on my knowledge
was clearly at an end, from then on I was acting "independently". Fortunately
there is no need to be Sherlock Holmes to deduce that if ...Nh5 was played,
the a future g5-g4 is being planned. Play after this was not very complicated.}
) 9. c3 $6 {The most natural but unfortunate reaction.} ({The computer
recommends} 9. Nh2 {, but I do not like this panicky continuation. Black
replies} g6 {and prepares to castle long; his position is simply one to dream
about.}) ({Here, in my view,} 9. Nc3 {is the best move. As I later discovered,
precisely this move was taken into account as the main continuation in my
earlier notes. The play which follows is similar to the way the game went, but
it is much better for White to have a knight on c3 rather than a pawn:} g5 10.
Nxe5 g4 11. d4 Bd6 12. g3 Bxe5 13. dxe5 Qxe5 {Here White may not have the
resource Qd4 available to him, but on the other hand his knight is already
developed. After the further moves} 14. h4 Bd7 {the position is still more or
less level, but playing it with Black is considerably more pleasant: he will
castle long and have the initiative – White's king and light squares are
weak.}) 9... g5 10. Nxe5 ({After} 10. d4 {the move} exd4 ({During the game the
continuation} 10... g4 $5 11. hxg4 Bxg4 12. dxc5 Qf6 {with a subsequent
activation of further reserves appeared to me to be interesting and I took the
decision to think more seriously about it if 10.d4 were actually played. Of
course, the computer first thinks that "White is a piece up", but then it
begins to be less and less optimistic. I let it calculate until it had
evaluated the position as level, then I stopped the analysis of this line.
Probably 10...exd4 is stronger, but I cannot exclude the fact that Black also
has a great game after 10...g4.}) 11. cxd4 Bb6 {(a wonderful place for the
bishop) is the simplest. Moreover, the computer can find nothing better than}
12. Nh2 Nf6 13. e5 Nd5 {It is irrelevant how great Black's advantage is here
– it is absolutely clear that White has lost the opening duel.}) 10... g4 11.
d4 {This is obviously the only move,} ({It is even somewhat embarrassing for
me to point out the variation} 11. hxg4 Qh4+ 12. Kg1 Ng3 {with mate on h1.})
11... Bd6 12. g3 {Once more, the only continuation according to the computer.}
Bxe5 {I think it would not be really appropriate to criticise this move. I
took in the facts that I was facing no threats, but from a human point of view
it seems somewhat strange to be dealing with development when it is possible
to recover the material and be able to remain with an excellent position.} ({
In reality, after} 12... Be6 $1 {the computer begins to be very worried for
White. In the event of} 13. hxg4 $2 Bxe5 {White will soon be mated. Otherwise
Black plays 0-0-0 and obtains a powerful attack in return for the pawn.}) 13.
dxe5 Qxe5 14. Qd4 {The most logical continuation.} ({There is still the
possibility of} 14. Kh2 {but it looks rather eccentric.}) ({And if} 14. h4 {
then} Be6 {– the threat is the capture on g3, when} 15. Kh2 {can at least be
met with} Qxe4 {winning a pawn.}) 14... Qe7 $5 {The decision, which is
characteristic of my play in Berlin. In this case the plan brought me success;
in a few other encounters it did not work, and in consequence I sometimes lost
half a point, sometime the whole point. Be that as it may, this game turned
out to be rather beautiful, which partially compensates for my losses.} ({
My seconds wondered why I did not steer the struggle into an endgame with an
extra pawn:} 14... Qxd4 15. cxd4 gxh3 16. Kh2 Be6 {Of course, I had also
planned specifically this liquidation a few moves before. Black gets in f7-f5,
White exchanges on f5, plays Nc3, Be3 and reacts to ...Nf6 with f2-f3. Of
course Black has an advantage but his win is still a long way away and in view
of the bishops of opposite colours White has chances of a draw.  During the
game I got into a "reckless mood" and after the moves ...Rg8 and ...Nh5 I felt
it a pity to go into an endgame. I noticed that after the retreat of the queen
to e7 Black had good chances of gradually developing a dangerous attack. To
put it like this: after the exchange of queens Black's advantage is
objectively greater but after 14...Qe7 it is harder for White to play. If
Black is lucky, the game can "win itself". That is what actually happened –
my opponent did not manage to find the best defence.}) 15. h4 {As good as
forced. If Black were to get in ...gxh3, he would then not only have a file
for the attack but also have obtained an extra pawn.} c5 {The idea behind this
move is to transfer the bishop to c6, to castle and to start the attack with
f7-f5. The knight does not look best placed on h5, but in the event of play on
the light squares it will not be possible for White to hold on to the pawn on
e4, whilst the white king is very weak. I was of the opinion that Black has
very good prospects here.} 16. Qc4 $2 {This is practically speaking the
decisive mistake.} (16. Qd5 {would fail to} Nf6 {.}) ({but during the game I
had seen that} 16. Qd3 Bd7 17. c4 {is ok. It is probably the only defensive
idea here: plant the knight on d5 so that it fulfils the role of a barrier
along the long diagonal even if after} O-O-O 18. Nc3 Rge8 19. Re1 Bc6 20. Nd5 {
Black has without any doubt a wonderful position.} {At the board I thought that
} Bxd5 ({I did, e.g., consider} 20... Qe5 {, but with precise moves the
computer can to some extent hang on:} 21. Kg2 {because} f5 {is met with} (21...
b6) (21... Rd7) 22. Bg5 {, it suggests for Black to instead simply improve his
position with 21...b6 or 21...Rd7. Black is better, But White's position is
capable of being defended – thus we can understand the evaluation of 0.5-0.6.
}) 21. cxd5 Nf6 22. Bg5 Nxe4 $5 {was strong, but the computer starts to
demonstrate some wonderful balancing acts:} 23. Kg1 $1 f6 24. Bf4 {with
various tactical resources which allow White to save the game.} ({not} 24. Bxf6
Qxf6 25. Rxe4 Qf5 26. Rae1 h5 {and after the fall of the d5-pawn White is
losing.})) {I suppose that Levon did not particularly like all that and he
found another, in itself very cunning, defensive option. He is planning Bg5,
because Black will not now have the reply f7-f6.} 16... Be6 17. Qb5+ c6 18. Qa4
{And now Black deprives his bishop of the c6-square, so that it cannot get on
to the long diagonal. In addition Black cannot castle because then the a7-pawn
is hanging. As I understand things, that was Aronian's idea and it would not
be a bad one if the specific details did not reduce it to nothing..} ({18.Qa4
could be regarded as the final mistake, but} 18. Qe2 f5 19. Bg5 Rxg5 20. hxg5
f4 {would not help either – that would only be a slightly better version of
what happened in the game.}) ({The computer recommends} 18. Qd3 {, but firstly,
that does not fit in with White's last two moves and secondly his situation
would have remained terrible even then:} Rd8 19. Qe3 (19. Qe2 f5) 19... Bc4 20.
Rg1 (20. Re1 Rd3 21. Qh6 Qe5) 20... Rg6 21. Qe1 Bd3 {and White has major
strategic, tactical and soon material problems. However, he would not lose
immediately.}) 18... f5 $1 {This is a typical idea, but Levon overlooked it or
did not notice in time its tactical justification – 19.exf5 Nxg3+!.  While
he was thinking about his next move, I wondered what I would do in his place
and suddenly I understood that White's position was absolutely hopeless. I was
even amazed at how bad everything was for him. The computer also recognises
that – if it is allowed some time, it gives roughly "-4" here. It was clear
to me that the business was all over, but in a situation in which all ways
appear to lead to Rome, it is also possible to make the wrong choice. So I
used a lot of time for the rest of the game in order to check over several
times even the simplest variations and not to do anything stupid – I have
previously had sufficient negative experiences in this area. But fundamentally
after f5-f4 Black's attack develops on its own.} 19. Bg5 (19. exf5 Nxg3+ $1 20.
fxg3 Bd5+ 21. Kg1 Qe2 22. Rf2 Qe1+ {with mate.}) 19... Rxg5 {This move can
hardly be considered a sacrifice.} 20. hxg5 f4 {White has no counterplay and
is simply mated. Weiß hat kein Gegenspiel und wird einfach mattgesetzt.} 21.
Qd1 Rd8 {Of course 21...fxg3 also wins.} 22. Qc1 fxg3 23. Na3 Rd3 $1 {I
suppose that there were simpler ways, but I decided to bring the rook closer
to the main theatre of action. It later turned out that this is the computer's
first continuation.} 24. Rd1 Bd5 $1 {The only way to duff up such a position
is by letting oneself be lulled to sleep by the plethora of available options.}
({It was clear to me that after} 24... Rxd1+ 25. Qxd1 gxf2 {Black has an
absolutely won position.  On the other hand, some of the variations arising
after 24...Bd5 were so beautiful that I felt the urge to finish the game in
style. And so at this point I spent my time above all not on uncomplicated
calculations but on an inner battle with myself: "That is beautiful! / But why
do you need to play it? Be a professional, take on d1 and f2 and win the game.
" In the end the artist had the upper hand.}) 25. f3 ({When looking at the
variation} 25. exd5 Qe4+ 26. Kg1 gxf2+ {for safety's sake I calculated it out
to mate, which was not particularly difficult.}) 25... gxf3 26. exd5 ({I had
been hoping for} 26. Rxd3 {:} Qxe4 $1 {of course I wanted to take with the
queen, although 26...Bxe4 would also be more than sufficient:} 27. Re3 f2+ 28.
Rxe4+ Bxe4# {, but that would have been somewhat too masochistic of Levon.  In
the final position Black is down by a queen and an exchange. I found it a pity
that the knight is still there on h5. It was even more impressive without it.
When I discovered this variation I could no longer resist the wish to play 24..
.Bd5.}) 26... Qe2 {This too I checked over some five times – in the end the
queen is really pinned.} 27. Re1 ({Or} 27. Qc2 g2+ 28. Kh2 g1=Q+ 29. Kxg1 f2+
30. Kh2 {and here the simplest is} Rh3+ $1 31. Kxh3 Qf3+ 32. Kh4 Qg3+ 33. Kxh5
Qh3# {Again very beautiful.}) 27... g2+ {White resigned.} (27... g2+ 28. Kh2 ({
After} 28. Kg1 {the number of black queens increases.} f2+ 29. Kxg2 (29. Kh2
g1=Q+ 30. Rxg1 f1=Q+) 29... f1=Q# {a rare mating pattern. Taking on e1 would
also be mate, but I would have chosen the double check.}) 28... g1=Q+ 29. Kxg1
f2+ 30. Kh1 Rh3+ 31. Kg2 f1=Q# {This game pleased both experts and spectators.
All in all it is not complicated, but impressive and the plan with ...Rg8 is
rather "fresh" and unexpected. It brought me aesthetic enjoyment, though all
that glitters is not gold: the game I won against Levon with White is more
interesting and more complex, so that I rate it higher from the point of view
of the art of chess. But I understand that the struggle we have just analysed
looks very spectacular and thus is not really such a usual occurrence in
supertournaments - that is why it attracted so much attention.}) 0-1
