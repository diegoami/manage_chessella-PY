Rxd8+ Nxd8 {Usually a knight and a queen are a better pair than a bishop and a
queen. But in this position, the knight doesn't really have a good square to
sit on and hence the bishop and queen duo are more powerful.} 35. Qd5 Qe7 (
35... Ne6 $2 36. Qxb7 Nxf4 37. Qb8+ Kh7 38. Qxf4 $18) 36. Kg3 $5 {What a
fighting choice by Nihal. He sees that the queen can come off anytime soon and
activates his king. A move like this is not without dangers, but the young boy
is taking his chances.} Nc6 37. h4 Qe6 $6 {I find this to be a dubious choice.
If any side would have chances in the endgame it has to be white. Firstly his
king is more active and secondly the bishop is superior to the knight when
there are pawns on both sides of the board. A better decision was to keep the
queens on the board.} 38. Qxe6 fxe6 39. Bd6 g6 40. Kf4 b5 41. g4 Kf7 42. h5 $1
