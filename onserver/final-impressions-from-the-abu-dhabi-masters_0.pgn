16. axb4 Rxa1 17. Qxa1 Nb7 18. Qa7 h6 19. Nd2 {Diagram [#] Javokhir who is
black has a clearly inferior position from the opening. He realises that he
should be playing on the kingside and the first priority is to activate all the
pieces.} Nh5 $1 {Not only clearing the f-pawn to move forward but also to
prepare a very nice maneuvre which we shall see in the game.} 20. Bf3 Rf8 21.
Rc1 (21. Be2 $1 {was a nice little idea to get in c4-c5.} Bf6 22. c5 bxc5 23.
Ba6 Bg5 24. Ncb1 $1 $16 {A difficult move to make, but the f3 square has to be
defended. If White can find this idea he would be better but these moves like
Bf3-e2 and Nc3-b1 are really not so easy.} (24. Bxb7 $6 Qb8 $1 $13)) 21... Bf6
$1 {Before going for f5 Javokhir improves his worst placed piece, which is the
bishop on g7. This is a very matured decision for a ten-year-old boy.} (21...

stranded on a7, the game will end with a decisive attack.} 25. Bh1 fxg3 26.

attack quite typical of young players. But what was impressive was the maneuvre
with Bf6-g5, improving the worst placed piece. That is not something which even
the most experienced grandmasters are able to do in their games.} 0-1
