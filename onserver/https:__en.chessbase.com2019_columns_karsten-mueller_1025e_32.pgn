90. Qd5 {Opposite coloured-bishops have two faces: in a pure endgame they are
often drawn because the weaker side is often able to defend on the squares
that his bishop controls. But with more pieces on the board the
opposite-coloured bishops indeed tend to favour the attacker. In this case
Black can use the attacking potential of his queen.} {[%tqu "En","Black to
