37. Qxb5 {The first game was drawn but things are good for Le Quang Liem. His
powerful knight on e5 and active pieces make White's king much more vulnerable
than Black's. The following maneuver, however, is just beautiful:} Qh5 38. Bd1
Qh4 39. Qb2 Qc4 $1 {Attacking the f1 rook, white Doesn't have a choice but} 40.
Be2 (40. Rf4 Qd3 $1 41. Qxa1 Qxd1 42. Bb2 Qe2 $1 {And the attack is simply too
strong. Nd3 is coming, for example.}) 40... Qa4 $1 41. Bb5 Qa8 $1 {The queen is
powerful on a8 as Ra2 is a real threat.} 42. Qb3 Qb8 $1 {Very precise! Now the
king on h2 is very uncomfortable!} 43. Kh1 $2 (43. Bc4 {was the only move to

pieces are pinned, Durarbayli resigned.} 0-1
