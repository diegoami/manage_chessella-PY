Nb4 ({Wesley So use a very active continuation in the center, advancing the d
pawn as a kamikazi regardless of his destination, because its main objective
was to open the diagonal a8-h1.} 10... Ndxc5 11. Bb1 d4 12. Rd1 d3 13. Qe3 b6

Moves like 11.Bb1 keeping the bishop in the great diagonal could be
interesting, very important also consider the paradogic advance 11.c6
supported by positional sense, perhaps not the most precise but if very
attractive.} 11. c6 Nxc6 (11... bxc6 12. Bb1 c5 13. Re1 $15 {Giving more
support to e5 and releasing in the future the g3 square for the knight's
passage.}) 12. cxd5 exd5 $11) 11... Nxd3 12. Qxd3 Nxc5 13. Qe3 Bd7 {As will
see the bishop in this square does'nt participate too much of the contest,
instead on the contrary obstruct a little the cordination of the pieces, maybe
b6 and try to develop for b7 could have worked better.} (13... b6 14. Bb2 Bb7
15. Rad1 Qc7 $15 {With a very interesting position, then try to take advantage
of the double bishops in the open position, obviously white also has some good
ideas d4 squeare is a good support and e5 peon gives an important space.}) 14.

{Maybe exchange the Queens and free her self a little from the press could
been a good continuation, anyway it is difficult to decide because the
activity of white is intimidating.} 27. Qe3 Ng5 28. Kf1 {Elegant move that
removes presion to the g6 rook, defends entry in 2 rank in future and
activates the king for a possible end game.} Qd6 29. Nf4 Qc7 30. Qc3 $4 {
[#] A major tactical error, losing the game almost instantly. Chess is
dangerous no matter how good your position is, if you lose your concentration
even for 1 minute everything can collapse like a sandcastle.} Rf6 $2 (30...
