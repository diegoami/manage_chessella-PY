{- Van Foreest-Carlsen, Round 5}) 7... a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6
11. c3 Bg5 12. Nc2 Rb8 ({A more common direction is} 12... O-O 13. a4 $1) 13.
Be2 ({Here, a specific variation is} 13. a4 bxa4 14. Ncb4) 13... O-O {Thus,
Black avoided both h4 (with his bishop still on f6) and a4 (with his rook
still on a8), what was the sense of his move order.} 14. O-O Kh8 $5 ({Instead,
} 14... a5 15. Qd3 Be6 {is what was played most often. A very young Kramnik
preferred this continuation against me in Dimitrovgrad, 1988 (I annotated the
game in the book Understanding the Sicilian), and it was well known already by
then.}) 15. Bg4 (15. a3 {was Radjabov-Carlsen, Round 11.}) 15... Bb7 $146 {A
new move, which is suggested by engines. So, Giri should have been prepared to
meet it, but his further play was highly unconvincing and only Carlsen had
winning chances.} 16. Ncb4 (16. Qd3 $5) 16... Nxb4 17. cxb4 g6 $1 $11 18. a4
bxa4 19. Rxa4 Bc6 $1 20. Be2 $6 ({A better edition of the exchange sacrifice
was} 20. Rxa6 Bb5 21. Be2 Bxa6 22. Bxa6 Qd7 $132) 20... Bxa4 21. Qxa4 f5 (21...
a5 $5) 22. exf5 Rxf5 23. Bd3 Rf8 24. Qxa6 $6 {Perhaps, he had to take with a
bishop.} Bd2 25. Qc4 Qc8 $6 ({White would have had a problem after} 25... Rc8
$1 $17 {followed by ...Rc1, planning to attack the f2 pawn sooner or later.})
26. Qe4 $5 Bxb4 27. Nxb4 Rf4 28. Qc6 Rfxb4 29. Qxd6 Qf8 30. Qxe5+ {Indeed,
Black could have played for a win after 30...Qg7, as the b2 pawn falls. But
after trading queens, White places his kingside pawns on g3 and h4, and even
for Carlsen's standards, Black's winning chances are low; objectively it's
indeed a draw.} 1/2-1/2
