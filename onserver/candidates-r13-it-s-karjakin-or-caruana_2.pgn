1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 O-O 6. a3 {The idea of playing
a3 before e3 is to discourage the Nbd7 move. Nbd7 now can be met with Nb5.} c5
7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. e3 Nc6 9. cxd5 (9. Qc2 {is the main line of this variation.})
9... exd5 (9... Nxd5 {is played more often by Black. Play might continue
something like} 10. Nxd5 exd5 11. Bd3 {which has already been played by
Topalov against Morozevich in San Luis 2005.}) 10. b4 (10. Be2 {looks normal
but allows Black to break in the centre with} d4 11. Na4 Bb6 12. exd4 (12. Nxb6
Qxb6 $11) 12... Bxd4 {This might not be such a huge edge for White.}) 10... d4
$1 {Nakamura is extremely alert and breaks right away in the centre.} 11. exd4
Bxd4 12. Nxd4 Nxd4 13. Be3 Nf5 14. Qxd8 Rxd8 $15 {Even though White has the
bishop pair, this position is completely favourable for Black thanks to his
developmental advantage. a7-a5 break looks strong and also Be6 followed by
Rac8 is not so easy to meet.} 15. Be2 Nxe3 16. fxe3 {Hikaru sank into deep
thought as to how he should use this small advantage that he has got out of
the opening. It is definitely an edge but not so huge and hence accurate play
is of paramount importance.} Ng4 $5 17. e4 (17. Bxg4 Bxg4 {is a pretty sad
position. The bishop is definitely superior to the knight and 0-0 is met with
Rd3.} 18. O-O Rd3 $17) 17... Be6 (17... Ne3 18. Kf2 $11) 18. O-O Ne3 19. Rfc1
Rd2 20. Bf3 (20. Kf2 Nc4 21. Ke1 Rd4 $15) 20... Rad8 21. e5 b6 22. Ne4 Rb2 23.
Re1 Nc4 (23... Nc2 24. Re2 $13) (23... Rb3 $5 {renewing the threat of Nc2 is
pretty strong.} 24. Re2 g6 $17) 24. Ng5 h6 25. Nxe6 fxe6 {Once the e6 bishop
is exchanged Black doesn't really have so much of an edge.} 26. Rac1 Rd4 27. h3

chances here.}) 34... Nxe5 35. Ra8+ Kf7 36. Bh7 g5 37. Bg8+ Kf6 38. Rf8+ Kg7
