1. e4 {What's this? I checked hundreds of games in the database, and found
only 12 examples of Stangl playing 1.e4. Is this some kind of chess
menopause--after all, Stangl is only just turning fifty. Or something directed
at me? If people know what defense I'm going to play, please tell me what it
is!} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 Bb4 {This is a bit trickier than} (4...
exd4 5. Nxd4 Bb4 {and I had done a bit of work on it (but not on the day of
the game of course)}) 5. Nxe5 {This move came right away, so Stangl obviously
wasn't surprised.} Qe7 6. Qd3 Nxe5 7. dxe5 Qxe5 8. Bd2 O-O ({It was of course
critical to avoid jet-lagged induced variations like} 8... d6 9. f4 Qe6 10.
Qb5+) 9. O-O-O d6 ({I only found out from a database check after the game,
that my opponent had played this all up to here.} 9... Bxc3 10. Bxc3 Qf4+ 11.
Rd2 {1-0 (31) Stangl,M (2535)-Goldberg,A (2405) Germany 1994 Black's strategy
hasn't worked because} Nxe4 12. Qd4 {wins a piece}) 10. f4 Qe6 11. Re1 {[#]} c6
{I couldn't recall if I meant to play this or} (11... Re8 {I felt covering the
d5-square was a bigger priority}) 12. e5 ({After the initial shock of the
opening, I settled in for a kill or be killed continuation like} 12. h3 b5 13.
g4 a5 {but Stangl takes the air out of the game}) 12... dxe5 13. Rxe5 (13. fxe5
Bxc3 14. Bxc3 Nd5 15. Bd2 a5) 13... Qd7 ({I thought} 13... Qd6 14. Qg3 {
might be slightly awkward, though the computer does not agree}) 14. Qxd7 {
This was unexpected} ({I thought} 14. Qg3 Qg4 {would be an effective answer,
but} 15. Qf2 {which I didn't catch for some reason, offers White chances for
the advantage}) 14... Bxd7 15. Bd3 Rfe8 ({I can keep the game flowing with
something like} 15... Rad8 {with minimal winning and losing chances. I decided
not to bother, since all of my teammates seemed to have excellent positions 
(and they all duly won).}) 16. Ree1 Rxe1+ 17. Rxe1 Re8 18. Rxe8+ {My reply to
Stangl's draw offfer no doubt surprised him--Is there a move minimum for
draws? The rules were a bit stricter this year than last year in Germany (no
cell phones in the tournament room, even for people not playing), so I
definitely did not want to risk getting fined! I decided to recapture while
they went to get me an answer.} Bxe8 19. Ne4 Bxd2+ 20. Kxd2 Nxe4+ {Of course
there is nothing for me to play for here, nothing for White either, as Black
will just blockade on the dark squares.} 1/2-1/2
