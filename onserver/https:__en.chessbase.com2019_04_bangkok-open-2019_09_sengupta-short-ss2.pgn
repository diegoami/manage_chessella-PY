1. e4 { Penultimate rounds are always very crucial. The side who wins
usually is able to fight for the top spots in the final round. Short was the
rating favourite, but Deep is well known for winning the crucial games in
important events. It was a fight to look forward to.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c3 Bd7 7. 0-0 h6 (7... g6 {is an interesting
move that could have been tried by Short, but it would have been well within
the realms of theory and it seemed as if Nigel wanted to get his opponent out
of book as soon as possible.} )8. Re1 Ne7 9. d4 (9. Bc2 g5 {followed by ...Ng6
is what Black is aiming for.} )Ng6 10. Nbd2 Be7 11. Nf1 Bxa4 12. Qxa4+ Qd7 13. Qb3 0-0 14. Ng3 (14. Qxb7 Rfb8 $19 )Rfe8 15. h3 b5 $6 {Not the
smartest of moves. This pawn is now a target for White after he plays a4.} 16. a4 exd4 17. Nxd4 (17. cxd4 c5 $5 18. Bd2 $14 )c5 18. Ndf5 Bf8 19. axb5 axb5 20. Rxa8 Rxa8 {White has a nicely placed knight on f5. But how to make
progress? There don't seem to be an realistic chances for a kingside attack
and hence Deep plays on the queenside trying to clarify the situation.} 21. c4 $5 bxc4 (21... b4 22. Qd3 {followed by f4 leads to interesting positions.} )22. Qxc4 Qe6 23. Qc3 Rb8 24. Bd2 Ne5 25. Qc2 h5 26. Bc3 {This was a good manoeuvre
by Deep, getting his bishop to the c3 square.} g6 27. f4 Nc6 (27... gxf5 28. exf5 $16 )28. Nh4 Nd4 29. Qf2 Bg7 30. f5 $1 {It's nice to see how Deep has
managed to create some play in the position.} Qe8 31. Nf3 Nxf3+ 32. Qxf3 Nd7 33. f6 {All that Black must do now is to move his bishop and get his knight to
e5. Thinking about all the possibilities, it seems as if Nigel hallucinated.} (33. Ne2 Bxc3 34. Nxc3 Rxb2 35. Nd5 Qe5 {Black should easily be able to
maintain the balance here.} )Ne5 $4 {The game is over now. Nigel Short
just blundered an entire piece.} (33... Bf8 34. Nxh5 gxh5 35. Qg3+ Kh7 $11 {
And while this looks scary, it seems as if Black is holding on.} )34. Bxe5 Qxe5 35. fxg7 $18 {White is just a piece up now.} Rxb2 36. Rf1 Rb7 37. Ne2 Kxg7 38. Qc3 (38. Nf4 {followed by Nd5 was a more clinical way to do things. But once
you are a piece up, then there is of course more than one way to win.} )Qxc3 39. Nxc3 Rb4 40. Rd1 Rc4 41. Rd3 Kf8 42. Kf2 h4 43. Kf3 Ke7 44. Nd5+ Ke6 45. Nc7+ Ke7 46. Nb5 Rb4 47. Nxd6 c4 48.
