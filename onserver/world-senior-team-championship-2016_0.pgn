1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. f3 e6 7. Be3 {I was
happy to see this position, thinking that although I have forgotten a lot of
the openings I once knew so well, I could certainly still play an English
Attack.} Qc7 {This has been played hundreds of times, but I regard it as
slightly inaccurate. There may well be lines in which the queen is better
placed on another square, so Black should play a more flexible move, such as
7...b5 or 7...Be7, first.} 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. g4 {More accurate than 9 0-0-0,
because now Black has no time for ...b5 and ...Nb6, followed by the retreat of
the f6-knight to d7.} h6 {This slows White up by a tempo, because it now takes
two moves (h4 and Rg1) to force through g5, but on the other hand more lines
will be opened when the pawn does arrive.} 10. h4 Ne5 11. Rg1 {Black has only
made half a point from the five games reaching this position in Mega Database
2016. It's a very small sample, but Houdini gives White a solid half-pawn plus
here, backing up my feeling that White is definitely better.} g6 12. g5 hxg5
13. hxg5 Nfd7 (13... Nh5 {is also possible, but the knight has little future on
this square.}) 14. O-O-O b5 {Black's play has been a little slow, but given a
move or two he will be able reach a satisfactory position by ...Bb7 and ...Rc8,
so I felt that I had to act quickly.} 15. f4 $1 {It's sometimes double-edged to
play this as it weakens the e4-pawn, but here the initiative is a more
important factor.} Nc4 16. Bxc4 ({I thought for some time about} 16. Ndxb5 {but
after} axb5 17. Nxb5 Qc6 ({after the game, my opponent pointed out a second
strong line for Black:} 17... Rxa2 18. Nxc7+ Kd8 19. Kb1 Rxb2+ 20. Kc1 Nxd2 21.

Bxc4 Qc6 20. Qxh8 Qxc4 {Black stands very well.}) 16... Qxc4 17. b3 { It turns
out that this is the first new move of the game. I prefer it to} (17. a3 b4 18.
axb4 Qxb4 19. Nc6 Qc4 20. Qd4 Qxd4 21. Bxd4 Rh4 22. Rdf1 {which only gives
White a very slight endgame advantage. Now Herbrechtsmeier-Ostl, Eppingen 1988
continued} Be7 $2 ({Black should play} 22... Nb8 23. Nxb8 Rxb8 24. Rh1 Rxh1 25.

26. fxe5 Rxg5 27. Nd5 {1-0}) 17... Qc7 18. f5 {The attack against e6 gives
Black no time.} Ne5 (18... Nc5 {is well met by} 19. b4 Na4 20. Nxa4 bxa4 21.
fxg6 fxg6 22. e5 $1 d5 (22... dxe5 23. Nf3 {threatening both 24 Qd3 and 24
Nxe5, is very strong}) 23. Rgf1 {with a very strong attack for White.}) 19. Rh1

Qb7 25. Ng3 {is also very good for White, since the numerous weaknesses in
Black's position and his exposed king count for more than the extra pawn}) 21.
exf5 Bb7 $2 (21... Qb7 22. Rh8 exf5 {was the best chance. After} 23. Bf4 b4
(23... Bd7 24. g6 $1 O-O-O 25. gxf7 {is also very good for White, since} Nxf7

Bd4 Rxa2 29. Qd3 {White has a huge attack for the two pawns, but the position
is still very complicated}) 22. Rh8 $1 (22. Rh7 $2 Rc8 23. Kb2 exf5 {is totally
unclear, but after the move played Black has no reasonable way to prevent a
sacrifice on b5}) 22... exf5 (22... Qe7 23. g6 Qf6 24. Rg8 Kd7 25. Kb1 $1
{followed by} ({not the immediate} 25. Bg5 $2 {when Black can fight on by}

Sicilian, just like the old days!} axb5 24. Nxb5 Qd7 25. Nxd6+ Ke7 26. Bc5 Ke6
27. Nxb7 Qxd2+ (27... Qxb7 28. Rxf8 {wins at once, so Black must exchange
queens into an ending two pawns down.}) 28. Kxd2 Ng6 29. Rh7 $1 Rb8 {Black is
unable to regain one of the lost pawns by} (29... Rxa2 { due to} 30. Bxf8 Nxf8

square, as the bishop stands ready to stop the f-pawn by controlling f2.} f4
