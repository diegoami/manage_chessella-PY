1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Somehow I find it curious that an attacking player and
excellent calculator like Yu Yangyi plays the Petroff.} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nd3 $5 {
Harikrishna avoids the main line and uses a positional weapon that he has
prepared.} Nxe4 5. Qe2 Qe7 6. Nc3 (6. Nf4 Nc6 7. Nd5 Nd4 {was played at the
Carlsen Caruana World Championship Match.}) 6... Nf6 (6... Nxc3 {is definitely
a playable alternative.} 7. dxc3 Qxe2+ 8. Bxe2 Nc6 9. Be3 {gives White a
developmental edge.}) 7. Nf4 c6 8. d4 Qxe2+ 9. Bxe2 d5 10. O-O Bd6 (10... Bf5 {
is a possible move, but after} 11. Re1 {The king on e8 already starts to feel
uncomfortable.} Be7 12. Bd3 Bxd3 13. Nxd3 $14 {White's position is to be
preferred.}) 11. Bd3 O-O 12. Nfe2 {The knight retreats to e2 to make the f4
square available for the bishop.} Ne8 {The first time you see the move, it
just seems wrong. Black is undeveloping the knight without any provocation.
But when you delve deeper you understand the point of this move, not just in
chess terms but also in psychological. In chess terms, Black wants to prepare
against Bf4 by exchanging his bishops and getting the knight to d6. In
psychological terms, Hari and Yu Yangyi had already played this position
before where Yu Yangyi had played Nbd7 and would not have been comfortable
with the resulting positions.} (12... Nbd7 13. Bf4 Bxf4 14. Nxf4 Re8 15. f3 Nf8

2018}) 13. Re1 Nd7 14. Bf4 {Hari keeps it simple, he exchanges the bishops and
doesn't try too hard to make the knight on e8 look funny.} Nb6 $6 {This move
definitely seems wrong. After a move like b3 the knight on b6 won't be doing
anything active.} (14... Bxf4 15. Nxf4 Ndf6 {The other knight will come to d6
and it looks fine for Black.}) 15. f3 $1 {A nice move taking the e4 square
away, but more importantly preparing to activate the king to f2.} a5 16. a4 Bd7
17. b3 h6 $6 {This move in itself doesn't make much sense. Black wants to play
g5 at some point to force White's hand. However, this same pawn will become a
weakness and help White to open more lines with h4.} 18. Nd1 g5 19. Bxd6 Nxd6
20. Nb2 Rac8 21. Kf2 $1 {The king clears the last rank, gets closer to the
game and prepares h4 followed by gxh4 and Rh1.} Na8 {As mentioned earlier, the
knight on b6 was not at all useful and tries to look for better squares.} (

looking at all the weaknesses.} Nc7 25. c4 $1 {Harikrishna is playing on both
sides of the board. The idea is c5 pushing Black further behind.} b6 26. Rac1 (
26. c5 bxc5 27. dxc5 Nb7 {makes the c5 pawn weak.}) 26... dxc4 $2 {A very bad
positional error by Yu Yangyi.} (26... f5 {This was definitely better. It is
possible to feel that the g5 pawn can become weak. But this was a situation
for desperate measures and Black has to go for it.} 27. hxg5 hxg5 28. Rh5 Rh8

spring to action.} 31. Nxf5 Nxc4 $1 (31... Nxg5 32. fxg5+ Ke6 33. Re1+ Ne4+ 34.

The b6 pawn is falling now, so the knight has to be taken.} Nxc4 28. bxc4 {
The net result of taking on c4 is that the b6 pawn is extremely weak and White
has a central majority which is quite easy to get rolling.} Rcd8 (28... Na6 29.
