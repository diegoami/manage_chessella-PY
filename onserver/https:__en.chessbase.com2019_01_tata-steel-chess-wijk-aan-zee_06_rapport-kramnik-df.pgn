the position is behaving very similarly to the Four Knights with 4.Bb5.} Nbd7 (

not to.} 9. Bb3 h6 {and White must make a determination about the centre.} 10.

being traded.}) 9. Ng3 Nf8 10. c3 Bb6 11. Bb3 Be6 12. a4 ({I can't help

White can't take a pawn, maybe he can magic the g3-knight to d4 and swap off a
pair or two of major pieces. However, this proves impossible.}) 18... Rad8 19.
