{(D24:3+3.5+3 = 9.5 points - the number in the FIDE Album 2013-2015 and the
judge scores by Becker, Minski, Salai jr. in that order are given) Levon
Aronian is a world class player, Oleg Pervakov and Karen Sumbatyan are world
class composers. Together they made a world class endgame study. Please note
the initial squares of the pieces. They will return during the play, in
problem terms a "switchback", marked with that word below. White is to move
and win.} 1. Bf4 $1 ({The first move must take care of the play that is to
come. The square h6 must be defended, or else the Bf8 can escape later, the
reason however is not easily seen.} 1. Be5 $2 Bxf3 2. Nc7+ Ka7 3. Nb5+ Ka8 4.

{(D88: 4+2.5+3 = 9.5 points) As Richard Becker was judge himself, he was
replaced on judging this study by Yours Truly. The very impressive study
received the maximum score of 4 points by me, showing three echo
underpromotion lines. The other judges disagreed, but even a moderate judgment
by me would have been enough for the inclusion in the Album. This however is
an example for the different tastes of judges. White is to move and secure the
draw.} 1. g4 fxg4 (1... d5 2. gxf5 d4 3. f6 $11) 2. fxg4 {and now the play

{(D32:3+4+3=10) This study incorporates, as the Album says: "Mutual battle
against promotion, sacrifices, anticipatory line-closings," and a neat ending
that we don't want to spoil by giving the description already. To Yours Truly,
this looks very much like a construction that could be used in a logical
moremover, i.e. a mate in x moves. In addition the play is easy to understand,
requiring no further comments. White to move and win.} 1. Rh5 g6+ $1 2. Kxg6

{(D14: 2.5+3+3=8.5 points) As you see, a good promotion to a knight can be
good to win the judges over, but also the rest of the play needs to be
excellent. Another such example is this study by master Bazlov. White is to
move and win.} 1. Kg8 $1 (1. Kg7 $2 b1=Q 2. f7+ Kd8 3. Nf4 Ne8+ $1 $11) 1...

{(D75: 2.5+3+2=7.5 points) The studies by Gady Costeff might be few, but
almost always with an incredible idea. This one is no exception. For now the
important part is that Black can move his knight on b2 to get rid of all
possible checkmate threats. White to move and win.} 1. Bc1 c4 2. Rf3 $1 (2. Re3
