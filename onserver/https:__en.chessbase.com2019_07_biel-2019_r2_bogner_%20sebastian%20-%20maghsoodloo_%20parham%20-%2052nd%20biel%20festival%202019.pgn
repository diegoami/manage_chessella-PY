{Sebastian Bogner has had a horrible tournament till now, but the mark of a
true champion is to bounce back from the most painful of defeats. This is what
he did today. his victim being Parham Maghsoodloo.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 (2...
dxc4 3. e3 a6 $1 4. Bxc4 c5 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. O-O b5 7. Bb3 Bb7 {and here the move
a6 is useful. In the game Black never got the same expansion.}) 3. Nf3 (3. Nc3
Be7 4. Bf4 Nf6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. e3 c5 {is what is discussed at the top level,
majorly thanks to Anand.}) 3... a6 $6 {This move is useful in the case of a
Queen's Gambit accepted or a Tarrasch, but after Bogner's response I wonder
how productive this actually is.} (3... Nf6 {is more accurate.}) (3... c5 {If
he really wanted to play the Tarrasch, this was the move order to do it. Here
for example after} 4. e3 a6 $1 {is a useful move, as mentioned by Axel Smith
in his book e3 Poison. White does best to wait with} 5. a3 $1 {and after} Nf6 {
Play a reversed Meran with} 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. b4 Be7 8. Nbd2 $13 {with a complex
position where practice has shown he has the easier play.}) 4. cxd5 $1 {This
move leaves a6 looking a little stupid.} exd5 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bg5 Be6 7. e3 Nbd7
8. Bd3 Bd6 9. Qc2 {Bogner has played natural moves. His plan is to castle
queenside and play on the kingside.} c6 10. Bh4 {In order to not give Black
additional tempi with h6 and g5.} Bg4 11. O-O-O Qc7 12. Kb1 h6 (12... O-O $5 {
was more double edged. Stockfish initially likes it for Black, but after
inputing a few logical moves it understands that White is having more than
just a nagging edge after} 13. h3 Bh5 (13... Bxf3 14. gxf3 $16 {is suicide -
there is no way Black is going to survive playing like this.}) 14. g4 Bg6 15.
Bxg6 fxg6 16. Nd2 $14 {and the threats in the center are fast approaching.})
13. Rc1 {It is already getting difficult for me to offer constructive advice
to Black. The move a6 has created more harm than good, as the dark square
complex on the queenside is very weak. Perhaps the combination of a6 and c6
wasn't the best way to proceed?} g5 {Parham is not making his life any easier.}
({It was time to think about quick development. However, even after the
relatively best} 13... O-O-O {Black is in trouble after} 14. Nd2 Rhe8 15. Na4 {
and what is to stop the knight from hopping to c5?}) 14. Bg3 $16 {White must
have been jumping with joy by now. He has a stable advantage and numerous ways
to improve his position. Black on the other hand has static weaknesses and no
counterplay.} O-O-O 15. Bxd6 $1 {It is important for this to happen now, as
otherwise Black can get time to play c5, after which most of his problems
should disappear. Bogner exchanges off one of the dark squared guardians and
prepares to invade on c5.} Qxd6 16. Nd2 Kb8 ({Bogner is just in time, as} 16...
c5 {is impossible due to} 17. dxc5 {and} Nxc5 {loses a piece to} 18. Na4) 17.
Nb3 Nb6 ({White uses tactics to complete a strategic maneuver. The point is
that} 17... c5 {loses a pawn due to the pretty} 18. dxc5 Nxc5 19. Nb5 $1 axb5
20. Nxc5 $16) 18. Nc5 {White has now occupied the weakness, and in the next
few moves he will aim to strengthen his hold over the queenside.} Nfd7 19. Qb3
{It is really nice how Bogner uses simple tactics to further his goals.} Ka7
20. Qb4 {Being under enormous pressure, Maghsoodloo finally errs and loses a
pawn.} Bh5 $6 {Perhaps Parham missed something simple while calculating?} (
20... Qc7 21. h3 Be6 22. Ne2 $16 {was unpleasant, but holdable.}) 21. Nxa6 $1
Qxb4 22. Nxb4 $18 {White has won a pawn and has no counterplay to deal with.
The game is effectively decided.} Nc8 23. b3 $1 {Controls c4 and creates
additional room for the king.} Nd6 24. a4 f5 25. a5 {Bogner has realised that
Black has nothing constructive on the kingside, so he further improves his
position on the queenside.} Nb8 ({If black tries to get creative with} 25...
Ne4 {then the simple} 26. Rc2 {puts paid to his plans.}) 26. Na4 Be8 27. Nc5 {
White still retains a winning advantage, but there were better ways to make
Black suffer.} (27. h4 $1 {is one way of converting that I feel is better than
the game. White creates additional weaknesses to exploit on the kingside.
After} Bd7 28. Nc5 Bc8 29. hxg5 hxg5 30. f3 $18 {and Black is hopelessly
passive and lost.}) 27... Ne4 28. f3 Nd6 29. h4 $1 {Once Bogner hits on the
right idea, it takes him only 12 more moves to clean up.} Bf7 30. Kc2 (30. a6
$1 {was a nice tactical opportunity. The idea is that after} bxa6 31. Ncxa6
Nxa6 {White has additional targets on the queenside, and Black's resisitance
will soon fold.} 32. Nxa6 $18) 30... Rdg8 31. hxg5 hxg5 32. Kd2 Be8 33. Ne6 g4
34. Nf4 Nd7 35. Be2 Nf6 36. Nbd3 {White has systematically improved his
position and is ready to strike. Black decides to retaliate before it is too
late.} b6 37. axb6+ (37. Ne5 $1 {was more clinical. The idea is that after the
normal} bxa5 {White goes after the house} 38. Nxc6+ Bxc6 39. Rxh8 Rxh8 40. Rxc6
$18 {and Black's position looked far better on move 1! He has absolutely no
counterplay and there isn't a single pawn that can be defended easily.}) 37...
Kxb6 38. Nc5 Nc8 39. Bd3 Ne7 40. Ra1 g3 $2 {Parham blunders mate.} 41. Nfe6 {
Bogner's spirit must be back to the highs after this game! A brilliant display
of technique and accuracy.} 1-0
