1. Nf3 {(0s) The Chinese have been like a machine in this event. In round four
they dismantled the young and talented Italian team 3-1.} d5  2. d4  Nf6  3. c4
 c6  4. e3  Bg4  5. h3  Bh5  (5... Bxf3 6. Qxf3 e6 {used to be considered the
safest continuation but recent results in 2015 and 2016 favor White. That may
have been the reason behind the Italian GM's opening choice or he may have
considered other matters that are unknown to your commentator!}) 6. g4  Bg6  7.
Ne5  e6  8. Nxg6  hxg6  9. Bg2 {(7s) Wang Yue is a very classical player. I
have always considered his positional understanding as one of the best of
players of my generation. The way he handles Dvirnyy's opening choice is no
exception to his style: "I get two bishops and I start grinding!"} Nbd7  10.
Qd3  g5  11. Nc3  Bb4  12. Bd2  Qe7  13. a3  Bxc3  14. Bxc3  Nf8  15. cxd5 
exd5 {( 99s) The position is closed and White needs to do something before his
pair of bishops become useless.} 16. Qf5  Ne4 $6 {(839s) This move is not a
blunder or even a positional mistake but this changes the game's character from
a tough complicated battle into a technical calm position which is more in line
with Wang Yue's strengths. In that sense, the Italian GM puts himself into an
unfavorable situation by entering into his opponent's area of expertise.} 17.
Bxe4  Qxe4  18. Qxe4+  dxe4  19. d5  cxd5  20. Rd1  O-O-O $2 {(314s) But this
almost throws away the game.} (20... Ne6 21. Rxd5 f6 {looks very drawish to
me.}) 21. Bxg7  Rg8  22. Bf6  Rd7  23. f4 $1 { (313s) This is exactly what I
was talking about Wang Yue's great understanding of technical positions.} exf3 
(23... gxf4 24. exf4 Ne6 25. Kf2 b6 (25... Nxf4 26. Rc1+ {loses the knight!})
26. Ke3 {with close to a decisive advantage}) 24. Rf1  ({I prefer} 24. O-O Nh7
25. Bd4 b6 26. Rxf3) 24... Ne6  25. Rxf3  Kc7  26. Rf5  Kc6  27. Rc1+  Kb6  28.
Ke2  Rg6  29. Rcf1  Rh6  30. R1f3  Kc6 $2 {(5s) played so fast and what is
worse: loses a pawn on the spot! I cannot say more other than blundering a pawn
was a contagious epidemic in the fourth round of Baku Olympiad!} (30... Rg6 31.
Be5 Nd8 {is very bad but not over!}) 31. Bxg5  Nxg5  32. Rxg5  d4  33. e4  d3+ 
34. Kd2  Re6  35. e5  Rd5  36. Rxf7 {(67s) An easy victory for Wang Yue.
Dvirnyy had a draw in his pocket but he made way too many mistakes!} 1-0
