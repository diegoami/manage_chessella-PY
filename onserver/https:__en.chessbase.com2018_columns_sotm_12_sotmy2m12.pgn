{This "White to move and win" study, winning also the 7th prize in the USSR
championship 1969-1970 for which likely published studies in that period could
be entered, is from the Georgian master David Gurgenidze. Gurgenidze is an
impressive man with great works both on malyutka ("baby" studies with up to
five pieces) and on complex themes. The study presented here shows the
"Novotny" theme, named after 19th century composer Anton (Antonin) Novotny. A
line is interrupted in such a way that two different line pieces - usually
bishop and rook - can take the interrupting piece, but in that way blocking
the line for the other piece. In this composition the theme is shown four
consecutive times. I believe that A.C. White would have very much loved this
study.    Personally, I met Gurgenidze and his son (who usually translates
English/Georgian) I think two times, always with a very positive impression.
Just like many chess composers, he flourishes not only in composing but also
in talking about this art, just as I believe every person will flourish in
talking about something they love with others of the same interest. He wrote a
few nice books about "baby" - and other - endgame studies as well, some only
available in Georgian.} 1. Ra8+ $1 ({There would indeed be an incomplete

of Dolgov in 1983, was found incorrect in 2011. White is to move and win.

{White to move and win. I believe I have already shown this here when
discussing queens last year, but if I did, showing it again isn't such a bad
thing, as the study is interesting, even if short. White wants to checkmate
Black but must not be checkmated himself, at the same time avoiding stalemate.
This leads to a fun little queen dance. The composer's name is Alexey or
Alexander Kotov, but he is not identical with the famous player.} 1. Bf6 Qb2 $1

{Sergiy Didukh, one of the more controversial people in composing due to the
polarizing but honest opinions expressed on his blog about contemporary
endgame studies, is universally deemed to be a great composer. Shortly after
my own composing began, he had one of his most memorable successes in this
study where White is to move and draw. It was published in EBUR March 2005 as
part of the informal Humor Tourney. An informal tourney is one where all
studies are published first, for example in a newspaper or magazine, or
nowadays on the internet, and then judged. On the opposite, in a formal
tourney judging is done first and only the studies which are awarded are
published. Usually the ongoing tourneys in magazines are informal while
tourneys organized otherwise are formal, but in this case the magazine EBUR,
organizing the tourney, decided the tourney with the theme of humorous studies
would be run informal, i.e. every entry would be published. While I have
derived greater humorous pleasure from other genres (see our July article),
sadly studies with accompanying humorous stories are rarely a theme, and here
also the study had to stand for itself without any humorous stories attached.}
