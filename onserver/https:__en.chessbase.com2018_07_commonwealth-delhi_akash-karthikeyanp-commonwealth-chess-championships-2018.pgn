of course you go for the Najdorf.} 6. a4 e6 7. Be2 Qc7 8. O-O b6 9. f4 Bb7 10.

17. Nd5 Bxd5 18. exd5 O-O {It already seems like Black has a very good
advantage in this position. He is solid, he has the control of the e5 square
and in general, he is much better.} 19. c3 Rae8 20. Rf2 f5 $1 21. gxf6 Nxf6 {
In general Whie cannot do much. He is overextended and there are weak squares
everywhere in his position.} 22. Rf1 Nc4 23. Rf2 h5 $5 {A typical Karthikeyan
move where he is trying to do something. The idea is to push on with h4.} 24.
Bh3 Qc5 25. b4 Qxd5 26. Bg2 Qxd1+ 27. Rxd1 h4 28. Nf1 Ne4 {Black is a pawn up
and has a completely dominant position.} 29. Bxe4 Rxe4 30. Bg5 (30. Bxd6 Rd8

sacrificed his knight somehow!} 0-1
