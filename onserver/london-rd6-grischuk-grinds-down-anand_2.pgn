$1{A nice little exchange worth keeping in your arsenal of positional ideas.}
15.Bxf3 c6 $1 {What Black has basically done is to give up his light
squaredbishop and place his pawn on c6. The b7-c6 chain form a formidable
barrieragainst the f3 bishop. Hence, this exchange by Aronian is common yet
quite anelegant solution.} 16. Qc2 Ne8 17. Bxe7 Qxe7 18. Na2 {Nakamura's
knightmaneuvre is pretty questionable. His idea could have been to put his
knight ond3 via c1. However, here White doesn't have so much time. Black
quickly breaksin the centre.} Nef6 19. Qc3 (19. Nc1 e5 $1 $11) 19... Ra8 20.
