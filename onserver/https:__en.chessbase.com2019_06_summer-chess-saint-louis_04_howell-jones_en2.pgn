has been reached several times before.} Bxb7 ({But so far only} 15... Rb8 {
has been tried, which should be easier because the white rook does not reach
the seventh rank.}) 16. Rxb7 Bc5 17. Rc1 Rac8 18. Bf4 Re8 19. a4 {[#]
Objectively speaking, White has almost no advantage, but in practice, Black is
in a defensive posture which few top grandmasters would enjoy.} a5 {And Jones
promptly makes a dubious move: He places his pawn on a square where the white
bishop can attack it. It's not long before this pawn is no more.} ({The first
promising alternative was} 19... a6 $1 {On closer inspection, one quickly
realizes that none of White's pieces can attack the undefended a6-pawn.}) 20.

Rxb4 Rc1+ 27. Kg2 Ra1 {[#] In the position reached, Black lacks sufficient
compensation for the pawn. Nevertheless, there are, of course, countless
drawing resources in rook endgames, even with a measly extra pawn. But Black
may have hours of work ahead.} 28. Rb5 Ra2 29. Kf3 g5 30. Ke3 Kg6 31. f4 gxf4+

Black is lost. And indeed he has placed his isolated pawn in range of White's
rook.} ({Black could draw with} 33... e6 {first. Then the burden would be on
White to show any way to make progress.}) 34. Kf3 Ra3+ {Another mistake allows
the white king to cross the fourth rank.} 35. Ke4 Ra4+ {[#]} 36. Kf3 {White,
understandably, backtracks. Marching the king to b6 could cost him pawns on
the kingside. How quick might Black's own pawns be? It's hard to judge, and
Howell believed he could prevail without taking the risk.} ({After} 36. Kd5 $1
{control of the 5th rank will ensure that Black's pawns won't get rolling.}

win for White.}) 36... Ra3+ 37. e3 Ra4 {[#]} 38. f5+ {Only now does White
finally relinquish the advantage. Black's king is released from guarding the
h5 square and can move to the centre. From there's it's much easier to curtail
the a5 pawn.} Kf7 39. e4 Ra3+ 40. Ke2 Ke8 41. Rd5 Rh3 42. Rd4 Ra3 43. Rd5 Rh3
