to happen was still a mystery.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5.

22. Rh4 d3 23. Nd4 Bb7 24. Rh8 {Played after a little bit of thought} O-O-O {
And after this Leko finally sank into a 20 minute think. A complicated position
that Giri no doubt had deeply analyzed.} 25. g6 (25. Kb1 dxc2+ {was
Jakovenko-Artemiev, 2013. Jakovenko won that game but the computers found a way
of equalizing somewhere somehow.}) 25... fxg6 {Giri seemed to finally be on his
own here, but he played this after only thinking 10 minutes.} 26. fxe4 Bxe4 27.
