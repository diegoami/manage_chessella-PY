This seems to be a novelty although I believe David had analysed it as a
possible move a while ago.} Qb6 8. Nbd2 e6 9. e5 h6 10. Bh4 Nge7 {White has
excellent compensation for the pawn but the game is still balanced.} 11. Bd3

active game continuation.}) 21. Kh1 O-O 22. Rxd7 Qc5 23. Re2 Ng6 {A dream

{An important game for Anton Smirnov as he is chasing a GM norm and at the
Olympaid they count as a 20 game norm.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bg5 Bg7
5. Bxf6 Bxf6 {Anton is our youngster that every Olympiad team seens to have, a
15 year 2500 player. When you walk around there are so many young faces
playing for so mmany strong teams.} 6. cxd5 c5 7. dxc5 Nd7 8. e3 O-O 9. Bc4
Nxc5 10. Nge2 Qb6 11. Qd2 Bf5 $146 {This novelty looks like a natural move but
if White can play f3 and e4 forcing the pieces backwards it can easily turn
into a passive postion for black.} 12. O-O Rac8 13. Rac1 Rfd8 14. b3 a6 15. Nd4

think is best?","","","d5d6","",10]} 26. d6 $1 exd6 27. exd6 Qb8 28. Nf4 Bxb4 {
[%tqu ]} 29. Nh5+ {The critical position. Young Anton finds the right idea but
in the wrong move order! The spectators were not sure themselves since at one
stage it looks winning and then one finds a defence then you break that down
and another one appears.} (29. Rxb4 $1 {The cleanest win!} axb4 30. Qe5+ Kg8

took a big step towards a GM norm which counts as a 20 game norm. He does not
have it yet but wins like these certainly help!} 1-0
