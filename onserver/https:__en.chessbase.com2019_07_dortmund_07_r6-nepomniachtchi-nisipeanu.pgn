1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nxc3 6. dxc3 Be7 7. Be3 0-0 8. Qd2 Qe8 {[#] This position has already been seen several times at the grandmaster level. With his last move, Black is ready to create pressure against White's long castle with the queen on a4.} 9. h4 {But White simply does not castle. With this innovation, "Nepo" goes for a direct attack against Black's king instead.} Qa4 {He plays it anyway! Of course, from Black's point of view, this prevents White from castling at all.} ({Meanwhile} 9... Nc6 10. 0-0-0 Bf5 {might be a better option for Black.} )10. h5 h6 11. Bd3 Re8 12. Kf1 $1 {A typical manoeuvre in such positions: the king evades the dangers in the centre of the board, while the rook hopes to come into play later via h3 or h4. But more importantly, Bxh6 is already a threat.} Bf8 {
Defending against the threat.} 13. Nd4 (13. Rh4 {would have been consistent now.} )Qd7 14. Rh3 {The exit via h3 (instead of h4) has the great advantage that the rook can now move directly to the g-file.} Nc6 (14... Qd8 {would have been the best defence here.} 15. Rg3 c5 16. Nf5 Bxf5 17. Bxf5 Re5 {White has a clear advantage, but the immediate danger would have been averted.} )15. Rg3 Kh8 16. Nxc6 bxc6 17. Bd4 {[#] Now the threat is Qxh6+.} Re6 {And then the game is already lost for Black.} (17... f6 {was probably tougher (though not really good).} )18. Qf4 Qe8 (18... Qe7 19. c4 (19. Bf5 c5 )f6 20. Bf5 $18 {was necessary.} )19. Re3 $1 {The e6-rook is stuck.} ({The game could have continued thus:} 19. Re3 Kg8 20. Qf5 g6 21. Rxe6 Qxe6 22. Qf3 gxh5 23. Re1 Qg4 24. Qf6 Qg7 25.
