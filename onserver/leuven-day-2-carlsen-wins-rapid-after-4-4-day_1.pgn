15. Qc4 b6 16. Bxc5 bxc5 17. h3 $2 {This is the source of White's problems. The
seemingly innocuous move is precisely that: innocuous. Both sides are playing
an opposite-wing race to see who's attack gets there first, and h3 is both slow
and passive.} (17. Qe2 Rb8 18. Bg2 {and if} f6 {then} 19. Nh3 fxe5 20. Rhd1
