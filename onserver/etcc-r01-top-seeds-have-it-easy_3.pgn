Rf1 Nf7 29. f4 e6 30. Kh1 Kh7 {Nothing special is going on in the position and
it is round about equal. But here Wojtaszek makes an uncharacteristic
positional error.} 31. Ng1 $2 {It seems as if nothing is happening but Ragger
is alert and takes his opportunity.} gxf4 $1 32. exf4 (32. Bxf4 e5 $1 33. dxe5
Re7 $17 {gives Black a clearcut positional advantage.}) 32... Nh8 $1 {An
excellent move by Markus. He would like to place his bishop on f5 and then his
knight on g6 and attack the f4 pawn.} 33. Re1 ({Just have a look how White can
end up in a completely lost position if he plays the natural moves.} 33. Nf3
Be4 34. Ne5 Bxg2+ 35. Kxg2 Bxe5 36. dxe5 Ng6 $17 {[%cal Gd7g7,Gg6e7,Ge7f5] The
bishop on h2 is a dead pieces, while the knight will rule like a king on f5.})
33... Bf5 34. Nf3 Ng6 35. Ne5 Bxe5 $1 {Of course the g6 knight is more
important than the bishop.} 36. fxe5 Nh4 37. Bg3 Nxg2 38. Kxg2 Rg7 $1 {What
started as a positional idea has translated into an attack on the white king.}
