1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kann does seem like a strange choice for a must win game.
The reason is that White has several dull variations to play against this.} 2.
d4 d5 3. Nd2 (3. e5 Bf5 {lately leads to interesting and unbalanced play. Not
exactly what Svidler is looking for.}) 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. Nh3
{Out of the many ways you can play against the Caro-Kann, this looks like one
of the best if drawing is the same as winning.} Nf6 7. Nf4 e5 {Yes, this is the
best move, but how can Black hope to win such an endgame?} 8. dxe5 Qa5+ 9. c3
Qxe5+ 10. Qe2 Nbd7 11. Nxg6 hxg6 12. Bf4 Qxe2+ 13. Bxe2 Bc5 14. Bf3 O-O-O 15.
O-O Nd5 16. Bxd5 cxd5 17. Rad1 {Black isn't really worse; his isolated pawn in
the middle of the board isn't that hard to protect and White can't much
progress against it. The problem is that he doesn't need to "make progress" at
all.} Nf8 18. Rfe1 Ne6 19. Be3 {Trade all the pieces!} b6 (19... d4 20. cxd4
Bxd4 21. Bxd4 Nxd4 {is simply unacceptable for Giri.}) 20. Rd3 Kb7 21. Red1 Kc6
22. Ne2 Rh4 23. Nd4+ Bxd4 24. Bxd4 b5 25. g3 Rh5 26. Bxa7 Ra8 27. Be3 Rxa2
{Giri can try as he may, but he will never be able to create anything in this
position.} 28. R1d2 Re5 29. h4 Ra4 30. Kg2 f6 31. Bd4 Rh5 32. Re3 Kd7 33. Red3
