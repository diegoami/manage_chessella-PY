1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Nf3 e4 5. Nd2 Bf5 6. e3 c6 7. Be2 d5 {A rare
line with not that many games played. Black has built up a center. However, it
isn't that stable and logically, White goes after it.} 8. g4 Be6 9. g5 Nfd7 10.
Qb3 {[%csl Rd5,Re4]} Qb6 $2 (10... Na6 $142 $1 11. Qxb7 (11. cxd5 cxd5 12. f3

Black has huge problems defending his center. As a consequence, he has to give
up one of his bishops.} Bb4 (14... Nb6 15. e4 Bb4 16. O-O dxe4 (16... Bxc3 17.

the biggest advantages of having pair of bishops - transformation of advantage.
By force, the White knight from b3 reaches d6, and that position is just
better and dominating for White.} bxc6 20. Re1+ Be6 21. Na5 Rc8 $6 (21... O-O

pasers with blockade on the light squares.}) 22. Nb7 Rb8 23. Nd6+ Kd8 24. Bf4
$16 {[%csl Gd6,Gf4] White has a huge strategic advantage now. The rest is a
matter of technique.} Rf8 25. c4 Rb4 26. a4 h6 27. g6 Rb2 28. a5 fxg6 29. Bc1
