{This is one of the decisive games in the exciting round 3 of this
star-studded event.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d4 e6 3. Bf4 {The London System has become
very popular even among top-level players lately especially this year.} b6 ({
The more popular line is} 3... d5 4. e3 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. Nbd2 Bd6 (6... Be7)) 4.
e3 Bb7 5. Bd3 Be7 6. h3 O-O 7. Nbd2 c5 8. c3 cxd4 {Taking now or later and
placing the d-pawn on d6 characterises the Queen's Indian setup.} 9. exd4 d6
10. O-O Nbd7 11. Re1 Re8 12. Bh2 a6 13. a4 Nf8 {All of the previous moves have
been seen before and White now normally continues with 14.Nc4, but Anish has
other plans...} 14. Ng5 $5 {With the idea to provoke a weakening on Black's
kingside and place a knight on e4.} Qd7 {Technically this is the novelty of
the game. Tomashevsky may not have been familiar with the Ng5 idea.} ({
Previously. what was played was} 14... Ng6 15. Nde4 (15. Nge4 $6 Nd5 16. Nf3 {
0-1 (39) Stevanovic,V (2287)-Mladenovic,S (2124) Valjevo 2011, and here Black
could've played the natural} Ndf4 17. Bf1 Bc6 18. g3 $6 Nd5 $15 {and b6-b5
minority attack will be next.}) 15... Nxe4 16. Nxe4 f5 $6 {this is exactly
what White wants} (16... Nh4 $1 17. f3 Bc6 {with a long positional struggle
ahead, where both sides can fight for an edge.}) (16... Bf8 17. Qh5) ({or} 
16... Bc6 17. Qh5 {is easier to play for White.}) 17. Nd2 Bf8 18. Bc4 Qf6 19.
Bf1 $1 (19. Nf3 Kh8 20. Qe2 f4 $1 {Black is fine and even won later: 0-1 (38)
Olejarczyk,B (2178)-Przybylski,W (2326) Warsaw 2010}) 19... Rab8 (19... Bd5 20.
Nc4 Qd8 21. a5 $14) 20. Nc4 Qd8 21. a5 b5 22. Nb6 $14) 15. Qe2 $1 {Not
allowing Black to realise his plan on the queenside.} Bc6 16. Bxa6 Bxa4 17. Bd3

Ke2 Kf7 31. Ne1 Nb8 32. Na7 $1 {Restricting the b8-knight.} ({Another good
idea is} 32. Nc2 Nc6 33. d5 $1 exd5 34. Bf4 Ke6 35. Be3 Bd8 36. Ncd4+ Nxd4+ 37.
Nxd4+ Kd7 38. f4 $16 {with a nice bind.}) 32... Bd8 33. Nc2 Ke7 34. Nb4 Kd7 35.
d5 $1 {Black couldn't do anything to stop this thrust.} exd5 (35... e5 $2 {
only gives White an outpost on c6 and less space for Black's pieces.} 36. f4 $1

Nac6 Bc7 39. Nxb8 $1 {otherwise he'll go Nd7-c5} Bxb8 40. Nc6 Bc7 41. Ke4 g6 (
41... b5 42. Kf5) 42. f5 $1 Ng7 43. Ne7 g5 44. Bg1 {with the idea of creating
another weakness on the kingside with h3-h4, and later followed by creating a
passed pawn on the queenside.}) 36. Nxd5 {White now has a long-term advantage
and we see him putting pressure on Black for the rest of the game.} Nc6 37. Nb5
$1 {Avoiding trades is favorable for the side with more space and vice versa!
In addition to this, White needs his knight to attack weaknesses on d6 & b6.}

more.}) 38... d5 39. Kd3 Nc7 40. Nd4 g6 (40... Ne6 {is a better defence:} 41.

44. Nxc4 Nf5+ $11) 41. c4 $5 {A good practical decision, White allows Black to
rid himself of his IQP to activate his king and exert pressure on the b-pawn.
Changing the structure of the game can also be unpleasant for the defender
especially when he doesn't expect it!} (41. b4 Ne6) 41... dxc4+ 42. Kxc4 Nc6
43. Bxc7 Bxc7 44. Nf3 $1 {White wants to place his king on b5 or a6. The best
analyst in the world (Komodo 10), assesses this as equal but this is deceiving
because it doesn't take into account 2 things: 1) The engine is the most
resourceful defender 2) a human will feel pressure and see "ghosts" in such
positions.} Bd8 (44... Na7 {is also possible but the knight here is misplaced.
Therefore a logical way to continue is to create play on the other side of the
board!} 45. g4 $1 Bd8 46. Nd5 {with Nd4, f4-f5 next.}) (44... Ne5+ 45. Nxe5+

has to be very accurate.} Kc7 ({The best analyst recommends that the best
defence is to invite the king to a6 and give up the b-pawn, which is very
counter-intuitive.} 45... Na7+ 46. Ka6 Nc6 47. Nd5 f5 48. Nxb6+ Kd6 {and I
doubt any human would be willing to go for this.}) 46. Nd5+ Kb7 {White has
gained good ground for his pieces, and will proceed to fix the weak b6 and
create threats with his steeds.} 47. b4 f5 48. Kc4 Kc8 49. Nf4 Bc7 50. Ne6 Bd6

transformation, this time to a very favourable minor piece ending!} Kd7 60. Kd5
{With a much more active king and weak enemy pawns on both sides, the rest is
"a matter of technique" for a top player like Giri.} Be3 61. Nh4 f4 62. Ng6 Bc1

here, a small pice of tactics!} Bc1 {.} 66. gxf4 Bxf4 67. Nxb6 Bg3 68. Nc4 Kd7
69. b6 h4 70. Kc5 Kc8 71. Kc6 {At this moment, both players are playing with
more or less a minute left on their clock. While this should be winning for
White he still has some work to do.} Kb8 72. Kb5 Kc8 73. Kc6 $1 {White decides
to move his king back to improve his knight first while also gaining time on
the clock! Great practical technique by Anish.} ({With little time left on the
clock, Anish wasn't sure yet if things were going to work if he went to a6 and
carefully, patiently makes the necessary preparation. Let's check:} 73. Ka6 Kd7

Kf6 76. Ka7 Kg5 77. Ng2 $18 {But of course it's easy to determine this when
one is only watching and without being under time pressure!}) 73... Kb8 74. Nd2
Bf4 75. Ne4 Bg3 76. Nc5 Bh2 77. Kb5 Bg1 78. Nb3 Bh2 79. Ka6 {Now White decides
to execute what is probably the only winning plan.} Bg3 80. Nd4 Kc8 81. b7+ Kd7
82. Ka7 {Seeing that his king cannot even make any headway towards White's
kingside, Black resigned.} 1-0
