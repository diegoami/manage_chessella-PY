1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5 3. e3 cxd4 4. exd4 Qb6 5. Nc3 a6 {This is a rare line
against the London system, but principally very sound. Black goes for
immediate counterplay. It is worth studying this line if you play one of the
Indian defences against d4.} 6. Qd2 (6. Na4 {Is interesting, White will gain
some free pawn moves and a little space but I don't think there is any
advantage here.} Qa5+ 7. c3 d6 8. b4 Qc7 9. c4 $11 {This is exactly the
position Jobava would like.}) 6... d5 7. O-O-O e6 8. Bd3 Bd7 $1 {A strong plan.
Black is ridding himself from his problem piece immediately.} 9. Qe3 Bb5 10. g4
$1 h6 11. h3 {A little slow, but all right.} Nc6 12. Nf3 Bxd3 13. Rxd3 Nb4 14.
Rdd1 Ne4 {Interestingly enough these are not the best moves. On the other hand,
White is under a lot of pressure. And it is not easy to play White here.} 15.
Kb1 Rc8 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Qxe4 Nd5 18. Bd2 Ba3 19. b3 Rc3 20. Ng1 $2 {In an
attacking position like this there is simply no time for this.} (20. Ne5 O-O
21. g5 hxg5 22. h4 {Would have generated enough play to balance the game.})
20... Nf6 21. Qe5 Qc6 22. d5 Nxd5 23. Qxg7 Rf8 24. Ne2 Rxc2 $1 {Allowing the
knight fork with a beautiful idea.} 25. Nd4 Rb2+ 26. Ka1 Qc3 $3 27. Nxe6 Qc2
28. Nc7+ Kd7 {And mate follows. This game shows Baadur did not play flawlessly,
however he showed strong fighting spirit, overwhelming his opponent completely.
} 0-1
