20. Nxf5 $1 {The first of a sequence of precise blows that end Black's
resistance.} exf5 21. Rxh7+ $3 {The point.} Kxh7 22. Qh5+ Kg7 23. Qxf7+ {
Possible thanks to the first move in the combination Nxf5, opening the diagonal
for the bishop on c4.} Kh6 {The first bifurcation in the attacking sequence.}
24. Qxf6+ ({White could have gone for} 24. Rxd7 Qxd7 25. Qxd7 { and though
winning without a doubt, it would have dragged out the game.} Rad8 26. Qxf5
Rd1+ 27. Bf1 Rg6 {allowing Black to still dream of swindles.}) 24... Rg6 25.
Qh4+ Kg7 26. Qe7+ Kh6 27. Rxd7 Qxc4 28. Qh7+ ({Theoretically, the most precise
was} 28. Qe3+ f4 29. Qe7 {and now the queen on c4 is cut off and Qh4 mate is
threatened. Black would be forced to start chucking piecee away to hold off a
few more moves.}) 28... Kg5 29. Rd4 1-0
