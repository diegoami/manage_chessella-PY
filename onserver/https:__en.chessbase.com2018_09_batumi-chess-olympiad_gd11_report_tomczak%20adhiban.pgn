1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {India needed a win and
the most natural strategy would have been to play solid as black and try with
white side. Anand and Vidit had white while Adhiban and Hari had black. Such
strategies wonâ€™t work with Adhiban on team ;-) Adhiban will be the last
person to shy away from taking risk or avoiding playing a complicated game. It
is pity that he could not win this game but one must give full credit to him
for trying his absolute best right from the very beginning. For today Mr.
Unpredictable Beast decided to play Classical Sicilian and looking forward for
a complex Rauzer battle.} 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qd2 Be7 8. O-O-O a6 9. f4 Bd7 {One of
the oldest line in Rauzer.} 10. Nb3 {I don't recall seeing this at top level.
This whole line with Be7-Bd7 lost its popularity mainly due to the mainline 10.
Nf3 followed by Bf6} (10. Nf3 b5 11. Bxf6 gxf6 {White has number of tries here.
What Adhiban had in mind as black will remain a secret for now.}) 10... b5 11.
Bxf6 gxf6 {With the knight oddly placed on b3 now black has no issues.} 12. Bd3
Qb6 13. Qe1 Nb4 {Aiming to exchange queens and get a normal comfortable
position. I felt with the knight far away at b3 black could have perhaps
started playing on queenside as white's play in center is not yet visible.} (
13... b4 $5 14. Ne2 (14. Na4 Qc7 {[%csl Ra4]}) 14... a5 {[%csl Rb3]} (14... Rb8
$5) 15. Kb1 a4 16. Nd2 Qc5 {White will eventually have to trade queens and
thus black would have gained some tempos compared to the game.}) 14. Be2 (14.
Kb1 a5) 14... Qe3+ 15. Qd2 Qxd2+ 16. Rxd2 h5 (16... Bd8 $5 {was an interesting
idea to make nice space for black king on e7 and activating the dark square
bishop little bit.} 17. Rhd1 Bc7 $132 {[%cal Ge8e7]}) 17. Bf3 h4 18. Kb1 Nc6
19. Rhd1 O-O-O {Not a big fan of this move in this situation. Why the king
will be safer on queenside and why the rook is better placed on d8 than on a8
is not at all clear to me.} (19... Rg8 20. Ne2 a5 {Position remains balanced})
20. a4 Na7 (20... b4 21. Ne2 Kc7 22. Rc1) 21. axb5 axb5 22. Ka2 $6 {I failed
to understand purpose of this move. Probably white wants to remove the knight
from b3 and then put his king on b3? I am not sure but it looks vague and
impractical.} (22. Nd4 Kc7 (22... b4 23. Na2 {[%csl Rb4]}) 23. b4 {[%cal Gb1b2]
} d5 24. exd5 Bxb4 25. Kb2 Bxc3+ 26. Kxc3 exd5 27. Re1 {was one possibility}) (
22. f5 {[%cal Gf3g4,Gb3d4] I like this thematic move as well.} Rhg8 23. h3 $14
{[%cal Gf3g4]}) (22. Na5 $5 Kc7 23. f5 Kb6 24. b4 {also looked interesting for
white.}) 22... b4 23. Ne2 Nc6 $6 {Something must have gone wrong here. Clearly
Adhiban's idea could not have been to meet Nd4 with Na7 back. He does make
many weird looking moves at times but this is too much even for his standards!}
(23... Kc7) (23... e5) 24. Ned4 Na7 {Seriously this could not have been a part
of his plan :)} (24... e5 25. Nf5 Be6 {Engine feels this is better than Na7
and it does make sense.}) (24... Kb7 25. Nb5) 25. c3 {White could have
prepared a bit more} (25. Rd3 $5 Kb8 26. Na5 $14) 25... bxc3 26. Rc2 Kb8 27.
Na5 (27. Rxc3 Rc8) 27... Rc8 28. Rb1 Rc5 {Now black is fine again} 29. b4 $6 (

likely fizzles out.} (31... Bd8 $5 32. Nac6+ Kb7 33. e5 (33. Nxa7 Kxa7 34.

Adhiban's play.} 33. Nxb5+ Bxb5 34. Bxb5 (34. Rxb5 Rxb5 35. Bxb5 Kb6 $36) 34...
Ra8 35. Rcxc3 Rxc3 (35... Rxa5+ 36. Kb2 {Hard to imagine black can win this
opposite color bishop endgame.}) 36. Rxc3+ Kb6 37. Kb2 Kxb5 (37... Rxa5 38. Be8

45. g5 Rf5 46. Re2 Rxf4 47. g6 {is one sample variation to show the draw.}) 38.
Rb3+ Kc5 39. Rc3+ Kb6 40. Rb3+ Kc5 41. Rc3+ {Just when everyone thought it
would now end in a draw Adhiban tried his best to keep the game and medal
chances alive!} Kd4 $5 42. Nc6+ Kxe4 43. Nxe7 Kxf4 {Unfortunately despite
having three pawns for knight and white king being far away, black doesn't
really have any advantage as the pawns are not going to roll that fast.} 44.

Kd3 Rf4 55. Rxf4 {Great try by Adhiban as black pieces who kept on fighting
until the very end.} 1/2-1/2
