1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Rb1 Be7 8.
Bc4 {This natural move is in fact a novelty.} O-O 9. Ne2 Nc6 10. O-O b6 11. Be3
Bb7 12. Nf4 cxd4 13. cxd4 {[#]} Rc8 $5 {Daring White to take on e6.} ({After} 
13... Na5 14. Bd3 Rc8 {the position is roughly equal but sharp - White will
try to attack on the kingside, Black will play on the queenside.}) 14. Nxe6 {
White accepts the invitation.} fxe6 15. Bxe6+ Kh8 16. Bxc8 Qxc8 17. Qa4 {
[#]White has rook and two pawns for two minor pieces and materially the
position is roughly equal. However, White's central pawns might become
dangerous and all in all the position is easier to play for White.} b5 $6 {
Black tries to liberate his position but even though he wins the exchange for
a pawn he is clearly worse after the following sequence.} 18. Rxb5 Ba6 19. Rfb1
Bxb5 20. Qxb5 {Now White has three pawns for a piece - and these three pawns
are strong.} h6 21. h3 a6 22. Qb7 Qxb7 23. Rxb7 Bg5 24. Rc7 Nb4 25. a3 Nd3 26.
e5 {White advances his passed pawns while Black has problems to create
counterplay.} Rb8 27. Kh2 Kh7 28. Kg3 Rf8 29. Rc6 Bf4+ 30. Kf3 {Cold-blooded -
Black has no dangerous discovered checks.} Ne1+ 31. Ke4 Nxg2 32. d5 {Now
White's passed pawns advance - White is winning.} Nxe3 33. fxe3 Bg3 34. d6 Re8
35. d7 Rd8 36. e6 Bh4 37. Kd5 Kg8 38. Rxa6 Kf8 39. Ra4 Bf6 40. Rc4 Ke7 41. Rc8
Bg5 42. a4 Bxe3 43. a5 h5 44. Kc6 {Black resigned - he cannot stop the pawns.}
