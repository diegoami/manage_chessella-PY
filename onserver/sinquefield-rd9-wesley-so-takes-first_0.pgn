played does not throw out the win,} 48. f4 {instead would have ended resistance
quickly and painlessly.} Kf6 {Forced since Rxc3 meets f5 and the e-pawn falls
with a fast-moving pawn roller.} 49. Kd6 Rd2+ 50. Kc5 Ra2 51. Kb5 {and Black is
in zugzwang and something must fall.} Rf2 (51... Rb2+ 52. Kxc4) (51... Kf7 52.

doubt.}) 48... Rxc3  49. Rc5 $4 {(103s) The first blunder that lets Black
equalize, but White will get further chances.} (49. Kc5 $1 {was best.} Rc2 50.
e5 c3 51. Kc4 Rxf2 52. Kxc3 Kd7 53. Rc5 {and with the black king cut off and
the white king ready to support the pawn advance, the win is straightforward
for White.}) 49... Rc2 $4 {(163s) An easy move to underestimate, but a fatal
blunder nonetheless that puts Topalov back in the winning seat.} (49... Rc1 $1
{was necessary. The reason is that attacking the f-pawn doesn't really help
Black's cause. It won't free the e-pawn to advance, and what Black really needs
to do is push his c-pawn as fast as possible, protected, for counterplay.} 50.

c3 pawn for the much less important f2 pawn.} Rxf2  52. Rxc3  Kd6  53. Rc4 $2 {
(197s) It isn't that this move changes the evaluation, but what is it for? Why
not a5?} (53. a5 {certainly screamed to be played, no?}) 53... Rf8  54. a5 
Rb8+  55. Ka3 $2 {(474s) The problem is that this fails to make progress, and
while it does not draw, the only way will be to backtrack and recognize that
Kc3 was the way to go.} (55. Kc3 {was less work overall.} Ke5 56. Ra4 {andn
with the rook behind the pawn, the pressure will be total.} Rc8+ 57. Kd3 Rd8+

Ra7  57. Rd4+ $4 {(883s) Topalov misses his last chance. With this move, he
lets Aronian's king out of his cage and free to join the fray. Now the position
is equal, even if requiring some technique, and the Armenian never lets go
now.} (57. Kb4 Rb7+ 58. Kc3 {and the game proceeds as in the line above with
55.Kc3.}) (57. Kb5 $2 Rb7+ 58. Ka6 Rb2 {and with the white king cut off, Black
can equalize himself.} ) 57... Kc5  58. Rd8  Rb7  59. Rc8+  Kd4  60. a6  Re7
