1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 {An interesting opening choice, used
in 2014 by Howell against me among other things; in this tournament it was
used not only in the present game, but also replicated by McShane later on, in
the first blitz tiebreak.} 5. O-O Bd7 6. d4 (6. c3 {The most popular move, and
the engine choice by a long chalk, but it does commit to a Kings' Indian type
of position.} g6 7. d4 Bg7 8. Re1 Nge7 9. Be3 O-O 10. Nbd2 h6 {Black tends to
simply get bad bishops here.} (10... exd4 $5 11. cxd4 b5 12. Bb3 Rc8 $132) 11.

board, but which was also played in front of the author of these lines.} (11.

arriving at a schematically quite similar position to the one I had against
Howell the previous day...} 10. Nc3 (10. c4 Be7 11. Nc3 O-O 12. Bg5 $11 {
is more likely to be an overextension. One thing I noted about the top players
in this tournament over the past week was that they want to somehow occupy
lots of space without committing that many pawns!}) 10... Be7 11. Bf4 O-O 12.
Rad1 Qc6 13. Nd5 $5 (13. Rfe1 $14 {White probably has a little something here
if he is just patient about it, but David Howell probably felt it was his
lucky day and tried to win without tiebreaks.}) 13... Nxd5 (13... Rfe8 {
is also okay, but a little passive.}) 14. exd5 Qxc2 15. Rc1 Qf5 16. Rxc7 Bf6

...Rc5xd5, or ...h5 maintaining both options.}) 18... Rxc7 19. Rxc7 Re8 {
Luke McShane shows an impressive devotion to principle, not worrying too much
about defending pawns. At this point, I would not be surprised if both players
already considered a Black win to be likely.} 20. h3 h5 21. b3 (21. Rxb7 Qb1+

clear where the mate will come from. For instance:} 23. Rc7 Rh1+ 24. Kg3 Qf5

on this move or soon, e.g.} 22. Bxd6 Rd8 23. Qe3 $1 $11) 22... Re5 23. Rxb7 $2

Howell had visions of weathering the storm and then grinding a long endgame
out with the better structure, but Black is too active for that to become
reality.} Be5 (24... Rd3 $5 $15) 25. Rb4 Qd3 26. f4 $2 {The decisive mistake.}
(26. g3 {was the only move according to the engines, but this would be
nerve-wracking to play after} Qe2 {The point is that Black does not deliver
mate after} 27. Kg2 Rd1 28. Rb8+ Kg7 29. Qc8 $11 {and must content himself
with ...Qf1 and perpetual check.}) 26... Qe2 $1 27. Kh2 gxf4 28. Bxf4 Rd2 29.

suspicions.} (9. Nd2 {is one of the biggest moves, and has seen recent British

oft-unnoticed class, and to the nerves surrounding this last-round encounter.}
