{This game was played in the last round of the state championship. A win and
loss would mean everything, if I win, I would make it to the top 15. Sadly for
me, I lost.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bf4 Bg7 4. e3 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. h3 c5 {[#]}

move on the board without thinking. Only after playing the move did I realise
that Be6 was theory.} (7... Be6 {JS Yes this very annoying move (for
occasional users of the London System like me) prepares Qb6 when it can't be
met by Qb3} 8. Nbd2 Qb6) 8. dxc5 {JS This is, possibly, the best answer to Be6
but here White doesn't need to make the decision yet and can just continue

hopes up for winning the game. JS I'm not so sure it's a positional error.
White gets some light square control in the centre which could be useful
though of course some endings could be disastrous. (You may remember Cohn v
Rubinstein where the black king got to h3 in a pawn ending and he won).} (14.

natural}) 17... a6 $2 {This weakens the b6 pawn which then led to my downfall.
All I can do is give an excuse, I wanted to win the match!} (17... Ne6 {or}) (

active rook which can harass the white kingside pawns.} (18... b5 19. Nb6 Rxd1+

that with the king on e2 it would be even better for White.} 22. b4 cxb4 23.

going to be entierly harmless.} Rf5 24. f4 ({One critical line is} 24. Kd2 Rxf3

I played this move thinking that activity of the pieces was more important
than material. Well, chess is a game with a lot of exceptions. Turns out that
this is one.} (29... Rg3 {would have secured the draw JS After Rf1 Rg2 leads
to the game but Black can play Kf6 instead} 30. Rf1 Kf6 31. Kc2 (31. b5 axb5

was a little hair raising to start with but Black is in time to stop the b-pawn and White has to commit that pawn to b7 which basically makes it into a
race.} (30... Ra2 31. b6 Rxa4 32. Rh2 Ra1+ 33. Kb2 Ra5 34. Kb1 Re5 35. b7 Re8

Black should normally be able to draw in postions "like" this though of course
it all comes down to the tempi.}) 31. axb5 Ra2 32. Rd1 Ra8 {here is where I

{This would make it to my list of one of the most satisfactory games I have
ever played. This was the State Championship played in Bangalore in April 2018.
My opponent was the 14th seed of the tournament and was one of the most
experienced players in Karnataka. Apparently, he was my coach. I had gone into
the playing hall without much expecation and was already predicting the
outcome.} 1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. d3 c6 4. Nf3 Be7 5. O-O d6 6. a3 O-O 7. Re1

not go into the standard plan as he is far from the standard set-up he would

square but White can try yo play Mh2-g4.}) 23. h5 h6 {JS This weakened the
white squares.} 24. hxg6 {JS There was no need to play this yet since ...g5 is
vile when the knight can enter on f5. By exchanging, White gives Black more
room on the kingside to defend himself and a route for the queen.} fxg6 (

and play e5 ASAP.} (27. f4 exf4 28. Bxf4 g5 29. Bd2 {Was a line I thought
would be a bit premature to execute.  JS I don't really see that the bishop is
so much better on c1 than d2. True it allows White to protect the d5 pawn in
preparation for the thematic e5 break but lines starting e5 Nxd5 are surely
going to be very dangerous for Black as White masses his forces in the
centre and against the king.}) 27... Ra7 28. f4 exf4 29. Bxf4 {[#]} g5 {

Nf5 weren't en prise then this might at least be interesting.}) 30. Bc1 Re7

want to resolve the tension as long as it's viable.} 32. Rxe4 $1 {

problems which my opponent was unable to resolve.} Rxe4 33. Rf1 Be7 $2 (33...

obviously cannot capture the Knight.} (36. Bd2 $3 {An engine move. This has
two sinister intentions, Re1 and c4 with Bc3. It would have been pretty hard
for any person to see this on the board.  JS I agree that there's an optical
problem that the bisop is loose on d2 but the threat of Re1 is huge. and
indeed utterly decisive.}) 36... Ng7 (36... Qxg4 37. Qxe7 {is the point}) 37.

his then rating of just 1515. After opening battle, Black looked perfectly
okay since he had the advantage on the queenside but the thematic break f4
created great attacking chancers for White and while, as you'd absolutely
expect, there were some inaccuracies, Kalki grasped his opportunities with
both hands when they arose. ,} 1-0
