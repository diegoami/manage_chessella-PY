Qc1 Nf5 {[#]} 16. e4 $6 ({The same type of mistake as 17...a5 from the first
game between the same opponents. Karpov displays premature pawn activity
before completing his development, again highly non-typical for him. Just as
in the previous game, a rook move would have been the proper preparing of
e2-e4:} 16. Rd1 $1 {something which in a better shape he would have played
automatically.}) 16... Nfd4 17. Nxd4 Nxd4 18. Bxh6 Nb3 19. Qe3 Qd3 $2 ({During
the game I was worried of} 19... Bxh6 20. Qxh6 Qd2 {, which, indeed, wins an
exhange.}) 20. Nd5 $1 Bxd5 21. exd5 Bxh6 {[#]} 22. Qxh6 $2 ({White should have
stabilized the position with} 22. Qxd3 cxd3 23. Rxb3 d2 24. Rd3 {keeping his
extra pawn with chances to win a second one after f2-f4. But moves like Qxh6
tend to be played automatically in rapid games.}) 22... Qd2 {Better late than
never! This move remains annoying despite the delay.} 23. Qh4 c3 {[#]} 24. Rbd1
$2 ({This loses without a fight. While Karpov was thinking, I whispered the
following line to mys on:} 24. Rxb3 c2 25. g4 ({According to the engines,} 25.
Rb2 {is slightly preferable, with chances to maintain approximate equality.})
25... c1=Q 26. Rh3 {First I thought White would be winning, until noticing} Kg7
$1 {leaving White with just some (but probably not enough) compensation for
the exchange after} 27. Qh7+ Kf6 28. Rxc1 Rxc1+ 29. Bf1 {, since his king is
also vulnerable.}) 24... Qa2 {The c-pawn will soon win a rook.} 25. d6 c2 26.
Bd5 cxd1=Q 27. Rxd1 Qc2 28. Qg4 {[#]} Qxd1+ $5 {The most practical decision,
simplifying to a won ending.} 29. Qxd1 Rc1 30. Bxb3 Rxd1+ 31. Bxd1 Rd8 {
Black's win is a simple matter of technique, but Gledura kindly offered a draw,
which ensured him the qualification to the final. I remember Karpov's
explanation of his draw offer with a pawn up in the 24th and last game of the
1974 Candidates' match against Kortschnoj. Karpov was leading with 12-11 and a
draw was enough to get him the right to challenge Fischer. He confessed that
he had little doubt that he could win the last game without too much trouble,
but felt this would have been a bit unfair, as his opponent had been
practically forced to play "va banque" with the black pieces in order to try
equalizing. In the same comment, Karpov also refers to a similar historic
episode from the 1935 Alekhine-Euwe match. Before the 30th and last game, the
Dutch challenger was leading by one point and he told to his opponent that he
would agree to a draw in any kind of position. Which actually happened after
Alekhine's unsuccessful atempts to attack left him two pawns down in the
ending...} 1/2-1/2
