{Perhaps inspired by the flying pieces on the other boards, Jesper decided to
play in a similar style and went:} 13... Nxg3 $1 14. Qxg3 Nxc2+ 15. Kd2 { and
now not} Nxa1 {as played in the game, which gives White counter-play, but}
(15... Nxe3 $1 16. Kxe3 exf4+ 17. Qxf4 Bc6 {A positional sacrifice, where I
would surely take Black, as White has a vulnerable king in the middle of the
board, b5-b4 is coming, the black bishop pair is quite a strong asset as well
etc.}) 16. Rxa1 Qb6 17. Rb1 ({Better was} 17. Kc2 exf4 18. Bxf4 {preventing
some Bxc3 ideas. I would take White.}) 17... exf4 18. Bxf4 Be6 19. Kc2 Rd8 {
Black won a complicated game further on but analyzing all the moves is beyond
the scope of the example. You can do so if you wish by downloading the pgn
games at the end of the article!} 0-1
