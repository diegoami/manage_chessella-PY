Rd2 Be6 15. b3 Rfd8 16. Rhd1 Rxd2 17. Rxd2 {[#] At first sight the position
looks completely even. But on close inspection we can find many minor points in
White's favour: 1. The white rook is already on an open file, Black's rook is
not. 2. The white king is closer to the center. 3. The bishop could come to f3
and pressurize the Black's queenside. Combined with Ne4-d6 it could be quite
dangerous. 4. The bishop on e6 is blunted due to the pawn on b3. When you put
this all together you do not get a winning advantage â€“ you get a nagging edge
for White which is difficult to defuse because the pawn structure is
symmetrical.} Kf8 18. Bf3 Nc6 (18... Rc8 19. Kb2 Nc6 20. Ne4 Ke7 {was surely a
better way to play as after} 21. Nc5 b6 22. Nxe6 Kxe6 {Black should be
alright.}) 19. Ne4 $1 Rb8 20. Nd6 f5 {Sargissian calculates deeply and sees
that he can get away by taking on b7.} 21. Nxb7 $1 e4 22. Nc5 $1 exf3 23. Nxe6+
Ke7 24. Nf4 $16 {White is a pawn up for no compensation.} fxg2 25. Nxg2 g5 26.
h4 $1 {Getting rid of the isolated h-pawn. If Black pushes on with g4, then the
f4 square is weakened.} h6 27. hxg5 hxg5 28. Ne1 Ne5 29. Rd5 Ke6 30. Ra5 Nc6
31. Rc5 Ne5 32. Kd2 Rh8 33. Nd3 Nxd3 34. Kxd3 Rh2 35. Rc2 {The way Sargissian
keeps control of the position is worth learning from.} g4 36. b4 Rh1 37. a4 Rb1
38. Kc4 {The rook defends the f2 pawn, which is the only weakness in White's
camp, and the king escorts his pawns to the queening square.} Ke5 ( 38... Kd6
{trying to run to c7 could have been a better defence, but after} 39. Kb5 $18
{the king will not be allowed to come to the c-file and White can win by
playing Rc4 and transferring his rook to f4.}) 39. Kb5 Kd5 40. Rc5+ $1 Ke6 41.
Rc4 {The rook defends c4, prepares Ka6 and is ready to keep everything under
control with Rf4.} Rb3 42. Ka6 {Grischuk saw nothing better than to resign. A
superb positonal game by Sargissian which I am sure will become some sort of a
classic in the years to come.} 1-0
