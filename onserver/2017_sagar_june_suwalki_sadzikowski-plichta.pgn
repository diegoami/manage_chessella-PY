wrong, but one cannot blame him after the tough defending he had to do
throughout the game.} (56... Rc6 $3 {is the brilliant defence. If you look
carefully, Black king has no move. Hence a stalemate is quite a realistic
possibility. The funny thing is that if it is Black to move here, he is lost.
It is only because White has to make the move that the position is draw.} 57.

trick!}) (57. Rb7 Ra6 58. Rb5 Bg7 $1 59. Rb8+ Bf8 60. Rb7 {And now you have to
be careful. Taking the pawn loses to Rh7.} Ba3 $1 (60... Bh6 $1 {also draws.})

progress the pawn has to be pushed.} 59. a7 (59. Kf5 Kf7 60. Bd4 Bc5 $1 61.

the point I really love. No matter what you promote to it will be a draw! Rook
or queen result in stalemate and bishop or a knight will not be sufficient to
win!} 61. axb8=Q $11 (61. axb8=R $11) (61. axb8=N $11) (61. axb8=B $11)) (56...
