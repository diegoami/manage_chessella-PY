1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 {"There is almost no opening in which the early development of
the QB is recommendable." (Dufresne/Mieses/Teschner)} Nf6 3. Nf3 c5 {"If White 
has not played c4 it is mostly good for Black to advance the QBP two squares."
(Dufresne/Mieses/Teschner)} 4. e3 Nc6 5. c3 Bg4 {At this point the "analysis"
of the opening ends with the third and last remark: "Black has a well
developed game." (Jean Dufresne/Jacques Mieses, Lehrbuch des Schachspiels,
26th edition, revised by Rudolf Teschner, p. 458)} *
