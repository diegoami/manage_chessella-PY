1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Jeffery's style has allowed him to adopt many
different openings. Bb5 against 2...Nc6 is not as sharp as the open Sicilian,
but that is perhaps what Jeffery was looking for.} g6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg7 6.
h3 b6 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Be3 O-O 9. Qd2 Re8 10. Nh2 {Even though the idea is not
new, this precise move is rather rare. White wants to push the pawn to f4 and
the knight rather lacks squares to go to.} e5 11. O-O-O a5 $5 {Even though
these structures can sometimes be positional battles, the players come in with
the will to fight. Black launches his own attack on the queenside.} 12. Na4 Be6
13. Kb1 Nd7 14. Ng4 Qe7 15. Nh6+ Kh8 16. h4 {No subtlety: both players are
going for mate.} b5 17. Nc3 f6 18. h5 $5 {Jeffery allows Aravindh to trap his
bishop on h6, but is banking on the strength of a future f4 break.} Bxh6 $1 19.
Bxh6 g5 20. Rdf1 Qf7 (20... a4 $1 21. g3 c4 22. f4 (22. dxc4 b4 23. Nd1 Nc5 $1
$15) 22... b4 23. Nd1 c3 $17) 21. g3 b4 22. Na4 Bxa2+ 23. Ka1 {Black is up a
pawn but faces serious challenges: the unstoppable f4 breaks open the kingside
and Black has to find a way to counterattack on the queenside.} c4 $1 24. f4
exf4 25. gxf4 cxd3 26. fxg5 dxc2 27. gxf6 {Even visually the position is very
double edged. Both sides are nearly getting mated, and it is only a question of
who gets there first.} Bb1 28. Bg7+ Kg8 29. b3 {Forced, but sufficient} Nc5 $2
(29... Qxb3 30. f7+ Kxg7 31. fxe8=N+ {gets mated easily} Rxe8 32. Rhg1+ Kh8 33.
Qd4+ Ne5 34. Rf8+) (29... Re5 $1 30. Rhg1 Rxh5 {Eliminating the pawn on h5 is
key to Black's defense, as the rook on h5 targets the h6 bishop after a
discovered check.It is rather inhuman, but it was the only way.} (30... Rae8
31. Bh6+ Kh8 32. Qg2 $18) 31. Bh6+ (31. Qg2 Ne5 $1 {And the knight jumps back
to g6.}) 31... Kh8 32. Qg2 Rxh6 $19) 30. Nxc5 a4 31. Kb2 $1 axb3 32. Nxb3 (32.
Nd3 $1 Ra2+ 33. Kc1 Ra1 34. Qxb4 {and White is surprisingly safe.}) 32... c1=Q+
{too early!} (32... Red8 $3 {What a concept! The queen is simply attacked and
White has no good square for it:} 33. Qe3 (33. Qe2 c1=Q+ 34. Nxc1 Ra2+ 35. Kxb1
Rxe2 36. Rhg1 $1 $11) (33. Qf4 Ra2+ $19 34. Kc1 Rd1+ 35. Rxd1 cxd1=Q+ 36. Kxd1
Qxb3+) 33... Rd3 $1 34. Qxd3 c1=Q+ 35. Nxc1 Bxd3 36. Bh6 $1 {and White gives a
perpetual}) 33. Nxc1 Bxe4 (33... Ra2+ 34. Nxa2 Qxa2+ 35. Kc1 {is winning for
White}) 34. Rhg1 Ra5 35. Rg5 (35. Bf8+ $1) 35... c5 36. Rfg1 c4 37. Qxb4 c3+
38. Qxc3 Rb8+ 39. Nb3 {Fearlessly White defends an almost naked king. Black
however has finally run out of threats.} Rxg5 40. Rxg5 Bd5 41. Bh6+ Kh8 42.
