1. c4 {Can you still imagine 1.c4 was considered boring. Those days are
definitely over!} e6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 Nf6 (3... dxc4 $5 4. Nf3 a6 $5 {This is
one of my favorite variations. Just putting it out there. But I can imagine
Nigel was trying to avoid complications against the Georgian star.}) 4. Nf3 Be7
5. O-O O-O 6. Qc2 b6 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. Nc3 {Here Baadur prefers to develop fast.
Playing a rare move which is very logical. It has only been played a handful
of times. Short now deviates from all games where Bb7 was played.} c6 $6 {
This is probably too slow. The pawn should fight for the centre in my opinion.
On the other hand, Nigel might have tried to counter Jobava's direct style
with this move.} 9. Rd1 Bb7 10. d4 {And White has a great position already.
The centre is for Baadur.} Nd7 11. e4 Nxc3 12. bxc3 Qc7 13. Bf4 Bd6 14. e5 Be7
15. h4 Rfe8 16. h5 b5 {It's tough to play the Black side here. The question
was, should Black allow h6 or not? Well Short allowed it and tried to make the
white bishop very bad. Au contraire, the bad bishop turned out to have a
wonderful life!} 17. h6 g6 18. Nh2 Nb6 19. Ng4 c5 20. Nf6+ Bxf6 21. exf6 Qc8
22. Bxb7 Qxb7 23. dxc5 {Personally I love the fact how Jobava's moves are
poorly understood by the engines at first. It really points out his deep
understanding of the position.} Nc4 24. Bd6 Qf3 25. a4 {It's very hard for
Black to untangle.} bxa4 $2 {giving away the last stronghold of the knight was
not so clever.} 26. Rd4 Na5 27. Rf4 Qb7 28. Rb4 Qd7 29. Qxa4 Nc6 30. Rab1 Rec8
31. Rb7 Qe8 32. f4 {Not allowing any chances is the best way to go when you're
winning.} Kh8 33. Qe4 Kg8 34. Qa4 e5 35. fxe5 $6 {Mistakes will come
automatically.} Qe6 36. Qb3 $1 Qxb3 37. R1xb3 Na5 {We also saw a knight fork
allowed in the game against Goh. And again it was wrong to go for it. As e6 is
winning.} 38. e6 $1 Nxb3 39. exf7+ Kh8 40. Re7 Nd2 41. Re8+ Rxe8 42. fxe8=Q+
Rxe8 43. f7 Re1+ 44. Kg2 Re2+ 45. Kh3 Rf2 46. Be5+ Rf6 47. Bxf6# {What a
wonderful finish. I forgot to tell you the tournament actually had two winners.
Baadur Jobava and chess!} 1-0
