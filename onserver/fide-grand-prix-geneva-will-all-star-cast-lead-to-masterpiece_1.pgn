Vidit-Bai, 2017.}) 14. Bh6 Bd4 $1 {Li Chao does well by keeping his best minor
piece on the board.} 15. Ne3 $5 {[#]} a6 $1 {Great timing.} ({Aronian was
inviting} 15... g5 16. Nf5 Ne5 17. Ng7 Re7 18. Nh5 f6 19. Nb5 $1 {with great
complication that might turn out to be favorable for White.}) 16. Nc2 ({ Now,
as the b5-square is covered,} 16. a4 g5 17. Nf5 Ne5 18. Ng7 Re7 19. Nh5 f6

this all-important advance.} 18. O-O Bxf4 19. Qxf4 Ne5 20. Qh6 g5 {[#]} 21. g3

sac the h4-pawn,} gxf4 22. Rxf4 Qg5 23. Qxg5+ Nxg5 24. Rxh4 {to keep full
control over the critical e5-square, along with clear Q-side prospects.}) 21...

Chao decided to strike while the iron was hot.} Nhf4+ $5 ({Something has to be
sad in favor of} 30... Rae8 {as there isn't much White can with his position.})

more than three minor pieces, and here Black also has an extra pawn.} Kd7 ({ He
needed to stay cool:} 39... Rhb8 $1 {is only a temporary inconvenience.} 40.

) 40... axb5 41. Nxb5 Ra1+ 42. Kf2 Rc1 $1 {this one is very easy to miss. Black
keeps his c-pawn alive and because of that he can bury the white bishop.} 43.

surprisingly the players agreed to a draw here. Despite his inaccuracy on move
39, Li could have still gone on.} 1/2-1/2
