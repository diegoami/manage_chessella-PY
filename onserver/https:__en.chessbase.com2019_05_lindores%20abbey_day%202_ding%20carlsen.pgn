3. Nf3 a6 $5 {This move has started becoming quite popular recently.} 4. Bg5 {
Ding Liren goes for a fresh position that is not deeply analyzed.} Be7 5. Bxe7
Qxe7 {Exchanging pieces might not be the right strategy when you are playing
in a must-win situation but here Ding feels that his bishop on f1 will have
more scope as compared to the bishop on c8.} 6. Nbd2 Nf6 7. g3 O-O 8. Bg2 b6 9.
cxd5 {Just when the bishop is about to be developed on b7 and Black is ready
to take dxc4, White takes on d5 and fixes the structure.} exd5 10. O-O Bb7 11.
Rc1 a5 12. Re1 c5 {At this point it seemed as if Black has very comfortable
play. His knight will go to d7 and his rooks will come to central files. White
doesn't seem to have any edge. But Ding Liren found a fine idea.} 13. dxc5 bxc5
14. e4 $1 {This powerful move must have been underestimated by Magnus.} Nxe4 {
Here the commentators were only considering taking on e4 as an option, but
Ding comes up with some very surprising.} (14... dxe4 15. Ng5 {already seems
quite better for White.}) 15. Nh4 $1 {You need to make moves like these if you
want to beat Magnus. f3 is a big threat now.} Qf6 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Rxc5 {
White has recovered the pawn and now both e4 and a5 are weak.} Na6 (17... Qxb2

even, White is just better.}) 18. Rxa5 Qxb2 19. Bxe4 Bxe4 20. Rxe4 Rad8 (20...

22. Qxd5 {White is now a clean pawn up, but Black gets his knight back in the
game.} Nb4 23. Qb3 Qxb3 24. axb3 {Let's take stock of what we have here. White
is a pawn up and logically this should be winning, right? I mean if you see
such a game given in any book, then the player with the white pieces has most
often won showing good technique. The problem here is that you have Magnus
Carlsen, one of the finest endgame players of our time, sitting with the black
pieces. Hence, Ding has to be careful, but at the same time he shouldn't be
overcautious that he is not able to take some calculated risks. Add to this
the pressure of winning the tournament and I think it became a bit too much
for the world no.3 to handle.} Rb8 25. Nf3 Kf8 26. Kf1 Nd5 27. Nd2 g6 28. Rd4
Nb4 29. Ke2 {So far so good. White has brought his king in.} Ke7 30. Re4+ Kd7
31. Ke3 Rb5 32. Kd4 $6 {Ding Liren is not averse about going into a rook
endgame. Is this a smart decision? According to Magnus it would have been
better to keep the knights on the board because in rook endgames the drawing
chances increase hugely. But Ding had his reasons to be positive. He has an
active rook, an active king, a healthy extra pawn and nearly 10 more minutes
on the clock.} Rd5+ 33. Kc3 Rd3+ 34. Kxb4 Rxd2 35. Rf4 f5 36. Kc5 Kc7 37. b4
Kb7 38. h4 h5 39. Rf3 Rc2+ 40. Kd5 Re2 {I would call this the critical
position of the game. Here Ding spent nearly 5-6 minutes of his time to figure
out a way to win. If you look at it, White has some important decisions to
make. He cannot win by keeping the status quo. That's because the king would
like to enter the kingside, but the rook on e2 guards it firmly. If you want
the king to enter, then you need your rook to take an active part, but that
would mean the sacrifice of the f2 pawn. Also the b4 pawn isn't going to queen
anytime soon. It's main purpose would be to distract Black so that White can
enter the kingside.} 41. Kc5 (41. Rd3 {is the critical line.} Rxf2 42. Ke5 {
[%cal Ge5f6,Gf6g6,Gf6g5] The king can now come to f6 and take the pawn on g6
or he can come to g5 via f6. Either way, this is quite dangerous for Black.}

much better coordinated.}) (41. Re3 Rxf2 42. Ke5 Kb6 43. Kf6 f4 $1 {This is
what Vishy was mentioning. He doesn't want to keep the rook on e3 because

is trying for some kind of triangulation. He has brought same position with
white to move. He sees the the rook cannot move from e2 and the king may have
to compromise his position from b7. Either move to b6 and allow some check
down the 6th rank or go to the last rank. Either way, this is an interesting
try, but Magnus continues as if nothing has happened!} Kb6 44. Rf4 (44. Re3

holding on by the skin of his teeth, but it is also true that a win doesn't
exist for White in these lines. A deeper inspection has to be made to come to
clear conclusion.}) 44... Kb5 45. Kd6 Kb6 46. f3 Kb5 47. Kd5 (47. g4 $6 hxg4
