{Before this game, I was leading and my opponent was on the 4th place, one
point behind. The game was decisive for the the first place and I would have
been quite satisfied with a draw. Of course, I wasn't going to play for a draw
frankly, but if I had the opportunity, I would have used it. That's why I
chose such a reliable opening. Before that I started all my games with 1.d4,
but Ivan plays nearly everything against it. And since we had a day off before
this round, I had enough time to prepare!} 1. e4 e5 {Apart from the rare
Sicilian experiments, this answer is strictly the only one} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3
$1 {Tight and reliable} Nf6 ({according to the Megabase, my opponent sometimes
preferred} 3... Bb4 {but I think it's dubious because of} 4. Nd5) 4. Bb5 {
Given the tournament position, I placed my opponent in a very unpleasant
situation. In order to win, he would have to make some concessions.} Bc5 {
Fashionable line. Although this is the first time Ivan played this way, it was
quite possible to guess} (4... Bd6 {I think it is the most interesting way to
avoid forced options. But I was well prepared for it as my opponent had
already played it}) ({Against} 4... Bb4 {I prepared the cynical} 5. O-O O-O 6.
Bxc6 dxc6 7. Nxe5 Re8 8. Nd3 Bxc3 9. dxc3 Nxe4 {On one hand, it's a little
embarrassing to play with White such a variation, but on the other hand the
great Mikhail Tal played in similar fashion against Ivan!} 10. Bf4 Bf5 11. Re1
Qd7 12. f3 Nf6 13. Qd2 {1/2 (13) Tal,M (2525)-Sokolov,I (2630) Barcelona 1992})

Nxd4 exd4 6. e5 dxc3 7. exf6 Qxf6 8. dxc3 $11) (4... d6 $6 5. d4 {Transposing
to the worst version of the Steinitz system in Ruy Lopez}) 5. O-O O-O ({
Once more, against} 5... d6 {White has the strong} 6. d4 $1) 6. Nxe5 {The
beginning of a forced line. A further series of moves is forced for both sides.
} Nxe5 7. d4 Bd6 (7... Bb4 $2 8. dxe5 Bxc3 9. bxc3 Nxe4 10. Qd4 $16) 8. f4 $1 {
That's the point! Simply taking the knight doesn't promise much} Neg4 {The
principled way} (8... Ng6 {is worse} 9. e5 c6 {and here the engine shows an
interesting solution:} 10. exf6 cxb5 11. Nd5 $40) (8... Nc6 {also doesn't
bring the equality} 9. e5 Be7 10. d5 {It's funny that this position was seen
in the game... Paulsen-Andersen! It is a good moment to remember how all the
new things are actually old forgotten ones:)}) 9. e5 Bb4 {once again the most
principled} ({Against} 9... Be7 {White should follow the same idea} 10. f5 $1 (
10. h3 d6 $1 {doesn't give anything}) 10... d6 11. exf6 Nxf6 {This position
appeared in two games of strong grandmasters: Wei Yi - Tkachev and Inarkiev -
Lysyj} 12. Qf3 c6 13. Bd3 Qb6 {and here I was going to strengthen the play of
the Chinese and Russian grandmasters with} 14. Ne2 $5) 10. f5 {The latest
trend in this variation where White lacks a piece, but f5 is a positional move
which opens the way for the darksquare bishop and clamps down the opponent's
lightsquare one.} Re8 $1 {Here my opponent thought for a long time which made
me realize that he was already playing on his own. It gave me strength because
I understood that I had won the theoretical duel and that my opponent will
have problems to solve over the board in the future. Nevertheless, he found
the strongest move.} (10... d6 $6 {It's too dangerous} 11. exf6 Nxf6 12. Bg5 c6
$2 ({it was necessary to play} 12... Bxc3 13. bxc3 $14) 13. Ne4 $3 $18 {
with crushing attack} (13. Bd3 $2 d5 14. Qf3 h6 {1-0 (49) Liang,A (2558)
-Morozov,N (2467) Tarvisio 2017})) 11. Nd5 {I would like to say that this is
an excellent move - White sacrifices the second piece but alas, this is only a
part of home preparation as Vlad Kovalev played it against Levon Aronian in
the last olympiad.} (11. exf6 {gave nothing} Nxf6 12. Bg5 c6 13. Bd3 h6 14. Bh4
Be7 $11) 11... Nxe5 $1 {Ivan is on top again!} (11... Nxd5 $2 12. Qxg4 {
White is unstoppable.}) 12. Nxb4 Nc6 13. a3 a6 14. Bd3 {Still following
Kovalev-Aronian game} h6 {The first deviation and not the best} ({It's
dangerous to accept the pawn sacrifice:} 14... Nxd4 15. Bg5 $36) ({Aronian
played the stronger} 14... a5 15. Nxc6 dxc6 16. c3 c5 $1 17. dxc5 Bd7 {I
wouldn't be surprised if this was still preparation.} 18. Bg5 Bc6 19. Qc2 Qd5

$11 {1/2 (30) Kovalev,V (2664)-Aronian,L (2780) Batumi 2018}) 15. Nxc6 $6 {
The first over the board decision for White and also not the best. It was not
necessary to relieve the tension.} ({The modest} 15. c3 $14 {gives the
advantage thanks to the pair of bishops while the f5-pawn offers White much
more space.}) 15... bxc6 $6 ({After} 15... dxc6 16. c3 c5 $11 {This is a
better version of Aronian's game. But, given the tournament situation in
Yogyakarta, Black has to win this game somehow.}) {So the opening is over.
White has the bishop pair and some advantage in development. Black has an
excellent outpost on e4 for the knight and hopes to exchange the lightsquare
bishops. In general, White should play dynamically, otherwise there is a risk
of getting worse.} 16. Qf3 {Natural but not the best.} ({At first, I noticed} 
16. Rf3 $5 {with the idea of hitting on h6. But after} Ne4 (16... d5 {is not
so clear.} 17. Bxh6 gxh6 18. Qd2 Kg7 19. Rg3+ Kh7 20. Rh3 Ng8 (20... Ng4 21.
f6+ Re4 22. Rf1 $18) 21. f6+ Re4 22. Rf3 $13) 17. Bxe4 Rxe4 18. f6 d5 {I gave
up the calculation, even though after} 19. h3 {the opponent has to find a
tough move} g5 $132 {Generally speaking, I was right because it is not
practical to consider an unclear continuation especially since there was a
very good alternative.}) ({As I wrote above, Black's hope is the exchange of
the bishops. It is logical to assume that the way to do that is with a5,
followed by Bc8-a6. How can White prevent Black's plan? This can be used as a
good positional exercise.} 16. Re1 $1 a5 17. Rxe8+ Qxe8 18. Qf1 $1 $14 {
Having solved the exchange problem, White gradually captures the "e" file and
a5 pawn may become an attacking target in the future.}) 16... a5 $1 {The only
move! Otherwise Black is much worse.} 17. Qg3 ({In another tournament
situation, maybe I'd try} 17. g4 $5 {although objectively after} Ba6 18. Bxa6
Rxa6 19. g5 hxg5 20. Bxg5 Qe7 {White doesn't have the advantage.}) 17... Kh7
18. Qh4 {Truth be told, during the game I thought that I was applying pressure
with this move because Black has no time to change the bishops, but...} Ba6 $1
19. Bxa6 Rxa6 20. Bg5 {It is important to exchange the last minor piece
otherwise the knight was ready to jump to e4.} a4 $6 {Too optimistic.} ({
Simpler and tougher was} 20... Rb6 21. b3 (21. Rf3 Re2) 21... Re2 22. Rf3 Qe7
23. Bxf6 Qxf6 24. Qxf6 gxf6 {with a much better version of the endgame than
what was played in the game.}) 21. Rf3 $6 {Unfortunately, this stage of the
game abounds with mutual mistakes. White misses the opponent's answer.} ({
Black's inaccuracy could be exploited with:} 21. b4 $1 axb3 22. cxb3 {and
White has the upper hand.}) {During the game I thought the rook will rach h3
then take on h6, but...} 21... d5 $1 {The cold shower! Thank God there is a
way out by going into the endgame.} (21... Re2 {was also good} 22. Rh3 Qf8 23.
Bxf6 gxf6 24. Qxf6 Qg7 25. Qxg7+ Kxg7 $44 {with good compensation for a pawn
due to the activity of the king and rooks.}) 22. Bxf6 {Forced but good.} (22.
Rh3 Re4 23. Bxf6 Qxf6 24. Qxf6 gxf6 $11) 22... Qxf6 23. Qxf6 gxf6 24. Kf2 {
So here we are, in a very interesting endgame. On one hand, Black has very
active rooks, on the other hand, White has no double pawns. Whose weaknesses
will prove weaker? As it usually happens in such cases, it should be about
equal with correct play. But in a practical game, anything can happen.} Re4 $1
{That's right! Black should play actively before White gets the time to
consolidate the position.} (24... Kg7 $2 25. Re3 $16) (24... Rb6 25. b4 $16)
25. Re1 {A very natural move! In a blitz game, I would have made it in seconds.
} ({The silicone mind immediately says that the passive} 25. Rd1 {was stronger
at least from a practical point of view. Black still has to find a few tough
moves.} h5 26. g3 h4 (26... Kh6 27. h4 $16) 27. Rdd3 (27. Re3 Rxe3 28. Kxe3 Rb6

32. dxc5 Ra5 $132 {I think the activity of the pieces will allow Black to hold.
}) 25... Rxd4 26. Re7 Rd2+ $2 {Time trouble and checks... Sadly, this move is
wrong - the rook is needed on the 4th line.} ({During the game I thought} 26...
Kg8 $2 {was weak because now there's always a vexing check on the last rank}

31. Kg1 Rd1+ $11 (31... Ra8 32. Rxc6 Re8 33. h3 $16)) {and now} 28... Ra8 $1 {
saves the game. It's important to take control of the last rank as well as
placing the second rook into the battle.} (28... Rd2+ 29. Ke3 Rxc2 30. Rd8+ Ke7
31. Rgg8 $18) 29. Rc3 Rd2+ 30. Kf3 Re8 $132 {I doubt that once the rooks are
connected, Black is still in danger.}) 27. Ke1 $2 {I was also in time trouble
so going for a forcing move is a natural reaction. But this is a mistake. I
managed to understand that the third line shouldn't be occupied by the king 
(the e3 square can be used by the rook), but I couldn't dare to step back
passively.} (27. Kf1 $1 Rb6 (27... Kg7 $2 28. Re8 Rd1+ 29. Ke2 Rd4 30. Rg3+ Kh7

there's nothing after} 27. Kg1 Rd1+) 27... Rxg2 (27... Rxc2 $4 28. Rg3 $18) 28.

and it is very risky to take it to a passive square in such an complicated
position.} (28... Kg8 $1 29. Rxf6 Kg7 30. Re6 Rxc2 31. f6+ Kf8 {Seems to be
very dangerous, but the engine is holding it.} 32. f7 Ra8 33. Rxh6 Ke7 $11 {
I haven't been able to find a win here :-(}) 29. Rxf6 $14 {Finally White can
breathe a sigh of peace - the black rook still stands on a6 and the white one
accompanies it from f6.} Rg1+ $6 (29... h5 {I was just gonna play} 30. Kd2 {
while keeping good practical chances to win.}) 30. Kf2 Rb1 $2 (30... Rc1 31.

{Needless to repeat what I already mentioned in all my previous articles but I
have to do it, for accuracy's sake. Novendra is the next Indonesian big talent
capable of finding new and newer rabbits in his hat, winning or drawing
'hopeless' positions. That is not mere luck but a sign of his fighting and
defending abilities. Three pawns up - that should be a rather straight forward
win for White, right?} 67... Ne4 68. Nd1 {1-0 would have been the most likely
