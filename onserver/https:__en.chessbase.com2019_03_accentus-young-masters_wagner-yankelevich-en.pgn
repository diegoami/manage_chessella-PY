d5 Nc5 8. Qc2 {In a rare treatment of the KID with 6.h3, Wagner uses the
strategy of replaying one of his opponents lines with White; Yankelevich
played this way in 2016.} O-O (8... a5 9. g4 c6 10. Nf3 {gave White a small
edge in Yankelevich, Lev (2443) 1/2-1/2 Jurcik, Marian (2497), Mitropa Cup 2017
} (10. g5 {looks promising.})) 9. g4 c6 10. b4 {Wagner spent over 16 minutes
on these last two moves, considering options after Yankelevich had omitted
playing a5 as in his 2017 game.} cxd5 11. cxd5 (11. exd5 Na6 {[%cal Ga6c7]
heading for c7 is equal.}) 11... Ncxe4 $5 {A surprising sacrifice, which the
engine likes. Black gets two pawns for the piece and causes White problems
developing and bringing his king to safety. Yankelevich played immediately,
indicating he had calculated this on the previous move if not in earlier
preparation.} 12. Nxe4 Nxd5 13. Bd2 Nf4 14. Ne2 d5 15. Nc5 ({Here the engine
prefers} 15. Rd1 {and Black still has a clear advantage, indicative of the
difficulties White faces in the position.} Qc7 $1 {is a flashy move that kicks
of a virtually forced sequence leading to a technically winning ending for
Black.} 16. N4c3 (16. Qxc7 Nd3#) 16... d4 17. Bxf4 exf4 18. Nxd4 Re8+ 19. Be2

Black wins back the piece with interest.}) 18... f3 19. Bf1 ({Even now the
f-pawn cannot be taken.} 19. Bxf3 Bxa1 20. Nxa1 Qf6 {with the same idea.})
19... Re8+ 20. Kd1 Rc8 {Black has an overwhelming position: He has two pawns
for the sacrificed piece, the white king is exposed and White's pieces are
barely in play and awkwardly placed. Black finishes the game energetically.}
