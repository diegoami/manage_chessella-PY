1. d4 {(0s) Shakhriyar Mamedyarov is known among chess players for his
flamboyant attacking style, creativity and original approach to the royal game.
In this game, he faced another original and attacking player, Super-GM Richard
Rapport, whose uncompromising approach has brought him brilliant results. All
these are indicative of a tense and exciting battle.} d5  2. c4  c6  3. cxd5 $5

cxd5  4. Nc3  Nf6  5. Bf4  Nc6  6. e3  Bf5  7. Qb3 {(190s) This move leads to
some complications. In most of the games in this line, White has just a small
edge but Black does not have so much counterplay.} Na5  8. Qa4+  Bd7  9. Qd1

{(72s) The engines suggest this move on depth 27! Nevertheless, this is a
logical move. White has the threat of Bg5. That simple isn't it? Nevertheless,
now Black cannot castle due to Bxh6 tricks.} 17. Rfc1  Bxc3  18. bxc3  Rxc3 
19. g4 {(10s) Logical! White sacked a pawn and now he is trying to capitalize
on his superior development.} Bb5  20. g5  hxg5  21. Bxg5  Rg8 $2 {(323s)
Nimzowitsch would have loved this 'mysterious' rook move. Unfortunately for
Rapport, this original rook move is not only a waste of time, it is a serious
mistake!} (21... Qc7 22. Rxc3 Qxc3 23. Rb1 Ba6 24. Bxf6 Qc2 25. Re1 gxf6 26.

to his knight on e5.}) 22. Kh1 $6 {(116s) This does not throws away White's
entire advantage but it misses a win!} (22. h4 Qc7 23. Rxc3 Qxc3 24. Qd1 Be2

earlier in a number of occasions, nevertheless, he managed to maintain his grip
and as a result he now has a winning rook endgame. Black's king is cut-off and
White's extra pawn will prove decisive.} Rh1  40. a4  e5  41. a5  Rg1+  42. Kh2

Mamedyarov. His opening choice and the way he handled the middlegame was
exceptional. Rapport has nothing to do but to blame himself for his Rg8.} (48.
