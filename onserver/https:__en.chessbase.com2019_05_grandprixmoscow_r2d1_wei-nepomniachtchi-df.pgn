{This game has the greatest mismatch in surname length out of any that I have
annotated for ChessBase. However, in the past I have annotated a game
Azmaiparashvili-Bu for another source...} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ ({If we
compare the position after} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 {
to the one after move 6 of the game, we see that Black has his bishop on a
somewhat more active square and also had options like ...bxc6. Black contends,
by playing 5...a6, that neither of these things matter.}) 3... Nd7 4. d4 (4.
O-O {is usual.}) 4... cxd4 (4... Ngf6 5. Nc3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 e5 7. Qd3 h6 {
would probably be my favoured way of playing- asking White to demonstrate
whether there is something he'd rather do with the b5-bishop than exchange it
on d7.}) 5. Qxd4 a6 (5... e5 6. Qd3 h6 {or similar is slightly less clever now
because White can play} 7. c4 $14 {and Black doesn't have the right piece
configuration to play the Kalashnikov structure.}) 6. Bxd7+ Bxd7 7. Nc3 e5 8.
Qd3 h6 9. Nd2 Rc8 {The note to move 4 is really an attempt to reach this
position- or something similar- while having economised on ...a6 (in the hope
of being able to build towards a faster ...d5.)} 10. Nc4 Be6 11. Ne3 Nf6 12.
O-O Be7 13. a4 O-O 14. a5 Qd7 15. Bd2 {We have reached a fairly equal
middlegame. Black now decides that for various reasons he can't get ...d5, so
it could be better to hint at a bishop manoeuvre to a7, while removing it from
the knights' sphere of influence so that he can play ...Ne8 and ...f5.} Bd8 16.
Ncd5 {I don't like this.} ({After the logical} 16. Rfd1 {Black might have
intended the computer's ...b5, but to me it seems more likely that the
intention was} Ng4 {-in which case White might well gain a tempo or two on the
game, for instance by} 17. Nxg4 Bxg4 18. f3 Be6 19. Be3 Be7 20. Rac1 (20. Rd2
Bc4 $1 $19) 20... f5 21. Nd5 Bd8 22. b4 fxe4 23. fxe4 {and while White is
still not better, the position has become a lot harder for Black to play.})
16... Nxd5 17. exd5 {Carlsen was commentating on the tournament, so it must
have pleased him greatly to see more elite players opting for this bizarrely
overrated structure with White! The move is essentially forced after Ncd5,
which is why I have the problem with Ncd5.} Bg4 18. f4 exf4 (18... Bh5 {
Keeping the bishop pair is a lot more natural.} 19. f5 {was presumably the
idea, but I guess both players missed the strength of the intermezzo} Bg5 $1
$36 {when Black exchanges off his bad bishop before playing ...f6, and also
sets up various motifs involving ...e4.}) 19. Nxg4 Qxg4 20. Bxf4 Re8 {
Threatening ...Re2, which White didn't feel like allowing.} ({Black had the
option to try and generate winning chances with another unstereotyped move in
the form of} 20... Qg6 $5 21. Qxg6 fxg6 22. c3 Rf5 23. Bxd6 Rxd5 24. Bb4 Bf6
25. Rad1 Rcd8 26. Rxd5 Rxd5 {when White holds with decent play but it could be
a little difficult to stop Black picking up a pawn at some stage.}) 21. Rf3 (
21. Bxd6 Re2 22. Rf2 Rxf2 23. Kxf2 {and now if nothing else Black can solve
his remaning structural issue with} Qh4+ 24. Kg1 Bxa5 $1 {and keep playing on.}
) 21... Bf6 22. c3 Be5 23. h3 (23. Bxe5 Rxe5 24. Raf1 Rc7 {leaves Black with
more active major pieces.}) 23... Qh4 24. Ra4 Bxf4 (24... g5 $5 {was playable,
interestingly enough, but maybe Black didn't like the version of the rook
ending which arises after} 25. Bxe5 Qe1+ (25... Qxa4 26. Rxf7 $18) 26. Qf1
Qxf1+ (26... Rxe5 27. Rxf7 Qxf1+ 28. Rxf1 Rxd5 29. Rb4 Rc7 30. Rb6 $14 {
Black's kingside is a bit looser than he would like.}) 27. Rxf1 Rxe5 28. Rb4
Rc7 29. c4 {Maybe White can claim something here: the plan is b3 and Rb6.}) 25.
Raxf4 Qe1+ 26. Rf1 Qe2 27. Qxe2 Rxe2 28. Rb4 Rc7 $11 {The position is dead
level: both sides have equally weak queenside pawns.} 29. Rf2 (29. c4 Rc2 30.
b3 Re7 {Unlike the previous note, here Black can activate at once, having
economised on ...g5.}) 29... Re1+ 30. Rf1 Re2 31. Rf2 Re1+ 1/2-1/2
