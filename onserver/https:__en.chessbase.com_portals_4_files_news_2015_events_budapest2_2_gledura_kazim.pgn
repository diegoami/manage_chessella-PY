{Both players have regrouped optimally but the unchallenged b2-bishop offers
White the better chances in the long run. Since White cannot improve his
position any longer, the next move is just logical: bishops need free
diagonals!} 15. dxc5 Nxc5 16. b4 Nce4 17. Ne5 dxc4 18. Nxc4 Rxd1 19. Rxd1 Bd5

work too well for Black, who faces the joyless perspective of an ending with
two knights dominated by the bishops. But White's next move solves all Black's
problems.} 24. e4 $2 ({The correct way to gain space was} 24. g4 Nd6 25. e4)
24... Nd4 {After occupying such a square, Black is completely out of danger.
Realizing that he had messed things up terribly, Gledura embarks an
adventurous attack, which will be calmly and effectively parried by his mighty
opponent.} 25. e5 Nxb3 26. exf6 Qd6 27. Rc3 Qd1 28. Re3 Qxe1+ 29. Rxe1 Rd2 30.
Be5 g5 31. Re3 Nd4 32. h4 {[#]} gxh4 $1 {This pawn will ensure the knight's
stability on f5. We can notice that Rustam's last game policy is different
than that illustrated by the second Karpov-Gledura game above. If the position
is better, why would one offer a draw just to win the match (or mini-match)?
This looks more like a Fischer approach!} 33. Re4 Nf5 34. Rg4+ Kh7 35. b5 Rd5
