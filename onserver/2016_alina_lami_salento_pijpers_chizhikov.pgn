Qxg7 Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 10. Ne2 dxc3 11. f4 Nbc6 12. Qd3 d4 13. Nxd4 Nxd4 14.
Qxd4 Bd7 15. Rg1 Nf5 16. Qf2 Qc6 17. Bd3 Qd5 18. Be3 $5 {An extremely
dangerous sideline that leads to very forcing play. Black must now find an
incredible series of only moves to survive.} Nxe3 19. Qxe3 Rxg2 20. Rxg2 Qxg2
21. Be4 Qxh2 22. O-O-O Bc6 {Here most games continue with 23. Kb1, but I had a
different idea ready.} 23. Bxc6+ $1 bxc6 24. Qd4 {This is the critical
position for the 18. Be3 line. Black has only one move to stay in the game,
and all other moves land him into big trouble.} a5 $3 {And my opponent is well
prepared and plays this move! Now the game should end in a draw, but I still
have a couple tricks left.} 25. f5 $1 {The critical try, but the computer does
not spot it and therefore my opponent missed it in his preparation.} exf5 26.
Kb1 Kf8 27. Qd6+ Kg8 $2 {And this is already the decisive mistake.} ({The
correct way to play was} 27... Kg7 $1 {with the amazing idea} 28. Qe7 ({
Another try is} 28. Qf6+ $5 Kf8 29. Rf1 Re8 30. Qxf5 Re7 {but now that the
black rook is helping in the defence it is hard to believe that white has any
real advantage.}) 28... c5 $3 29. Ka1 Ra6 {and Black defends.}) 28. Qe7 $18 Qf2
29. Ka1 Qg3 30. e6 {The human way to win the position. Objectively it is not
the strongest, but I was confident I could win the resulting endgame.} ({
The computer shows that after} 30. Qc5 Qh2 31. Qxc6 {the black queen will also
be lost eventually, with a couple extra pawns for me compared to the game.})
30... Rf8 31. Qc5 fxe6 32. Rg1 Qxg1+ 33. Qxg1+ Kf7 34. Qa7+ Kg6 35. Qxa5 f4 36.
Qe5 Rf6 37. Qe4+ Kg5 {Here I found a nice way to stop the pawns from running.}
38. Qf3 e5 39. Qe4 f3 ({The point was} 39... Rf5 40. Qg2+ Kh4 41. Qf3 {.}) 40.
Qxe5+ {Now the rest is easy.} Rf5 41. Qg3+ Kh5 42. Qf2 Kg4 43. Ka2 Rd5 44. Qg1+
