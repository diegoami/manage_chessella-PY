{At this point Sandipan
was already leading the tournament by half a point. With the white pieces
he could have tried to play for a draw, but instead he came to the board
with an intention to fight and play for a win.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 g6 3.

Well, that's the half truth. Re5 does win a piece but Black is able to
cause some grave damage to White's position and pawn structure.} 22. Re5
{[%cal Ge1e5]} {[%tqu "It seems like Black is losing a piece. What should
be do?","","",Nxa4,"A blow for a blow! It's true that Black loses a piece,

the resulting position things are far from clear as the knight on a3 would

24. bxc3 {[#] Let us try and assess this position. White is a piece up
but his forces are in complete discord. The two rooks on the kingside
can be trapped and the funny thing is that this is not the most worrying
factor. The knight on a3 is faced with an uneviable task of blockading
the a5 pawn. Also the b7-c6 structure is most often bad for the g2 bishop.
But, finally material is material. White can maintain the balance but
one would not be wrong if he said that it is easier to play with the black
pieces. What is very interesting to note is that Ikonnikov would have
most certainly not assessed this position when he went for 19...Nc5. And
Sandipan who was trying to play only for two results was suddenly feeling
the heat as all three outcomes were possible now.} f5 { [%csl

another possibilty that gave Black good compensation, but one would not
like the rook on h4 to come back to the game in a move.} 25. Rd4 $1) (24...

no Re5, White is badly placed.}) 26. Bh3 Rd1+ (26... f4 27. Re5 $1 $16

Ra1 28. Nc2 Rc1 29. Nd4 {The game becomes extremely sharp now. The knight
on a3 enters the game and is proudly standing on d4. But it means that
the a5 pawn is now free to roll.} f4 $6 ({A sample variation of just pushing

to be to take with the h-rook, but it is important to leave a rook targetting
