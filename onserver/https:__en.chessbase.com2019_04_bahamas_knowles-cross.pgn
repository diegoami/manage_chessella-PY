1. Nf3 f5 {I hadn't played the Dutch against Kendrick before and I wanted to
test out his knowledge. I had four and a half out of five at this point in the
tournament and didn't want to spoil things with a loss.} 2. d4 Nf6 3. g3 g6 4.
Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 d6 7. Nc3 c6 8. b3 a5 9. Bb2 Na6 10. e3 Qc7 11. Qe2 {
I knew this couldn't be correct. The queen belongs on c2. The trick is to
figure out how to punish it.} e5 12. dxe5 dxe5 13. Rfd1 Nc5 (13... e4 14. Nd4
Nc5 15. Ba3 b6 $11) 14. Ba3 {Suddenly I was unhappy with my position. I
figured my Nc5 move must have been wrong.} Nfd7 (14... b6 $142 15. Na4 Nfd7 $11
) 15. Na4 {I was relieved to see this move, as I felt it gave me a tactical
means to get back to equality.} Nxa4 16. Bxf8 Nc3 17. Qc2 $2 {Kendrick almost
always plays too fast. My problem is that when he plays too fast, I tend to
mimick him. Bad idea! Playing his queen to c2 simply drops the e3 pawn.} (17.
Qe1 $142 Nxd1 18. Bxg7 Nxf2 19. Bxe5 Nh3+ 20. Bxh3 Nxe5 $11) 17... Kxf8 $4 {
I played this howler after just a couple of seconds, playing fast like
Kendrick was doing. If I had given the position just a few more seconds of
analysis I would have easily seen what was wrong with my move. I had seen that
taking the rook with the knight led to an advantage--the problem was that I
thought I saw a quicker way to win and I simply played it without taking the
time to really figure it out.} (17... Nxd1 18. Bxg7 Nxe3 19. Qc3 Kxg7 20. Qxe3
e4 $17) 18. Qxc3 e4 19. Nd4 {My superficial tactical vision of a couple moves
ago had shown me playing c5 here to win the knight. Naturally I now saw that
this fails to a rather obvious royal fork.} Ne5 20. c5 Qe7 21. Rac1 Nd3 22. Rc2

going for it.} (28. Bxa6 Rxa6 29. Nb5 $16) 28... bxc6 29. Rxc6 Be7 30. a3 $2 (

Bb7 31. Rb6 Ra7 {I didn't like how tangled up my pieces got here, but I
thought I'd be able to untangle them soon and perhaps even dream of being
better.} 32. b4 axb4 33. axb4 Nc7 34. Rd7 Bd5 $4 {I missed 36. Rc8.} (34... Bc8
