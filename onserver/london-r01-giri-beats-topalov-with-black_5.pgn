c5 9. Re1 Bf5 $6 {This has been played once before by van Wely against Simen
Agdestein.} (9... Nc6 {is much better.}) 10. Ng5 $1 {A strong move attacking
the b7 pawn.} Bc8 {A sad retreat. At this point White should surely have an
advantage.} (10... Nc6 11. d5 Na5 12. e4 Bg4 13. f3 Bc8 14. Be3 {gave White a
clear opening edge in Agdestein-van Wely.}) 11. Rb1 h6 12. Nf3 Nc6 13. h3 $6 {
A very tame move and the reason for such a quick draw.} (13. e4 $1 {was
definitely the best move and would have given White a clear edge.} Bg4 14. d5
$1 Ne5 15. Rxb7 $14) 13... Bf5 14. Rxb7 Be4 (14... Ne4 $1) 15. Rb5 {A draw was
agreed, although one can argue that White is a slightly better in the final
position.} 1/2-1/2
