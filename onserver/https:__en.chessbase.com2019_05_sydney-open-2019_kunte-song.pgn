moves this setup will end up looking quite passive, and the main place Black
needs to watch out in the short/ medium-term is the c-file.} 9. Nc3 Bb7 10. Ne5

that he is almost lost after it, and in fact I agree with his assessment.} (

very unpleasant, perhaps at the elite-GM level it could already be considered
as lost. The rest is one-way traffic to a great extent.} Re8 (15... c5 {
