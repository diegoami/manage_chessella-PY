{I decided to take a look at the top clash at the challengers!} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4
g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O exd4 {An interesting
offbeat line which was probably a surprise to Korobov.} (7... Nc6 {is the
undisputed mainline.}) 8. Nxd4 Re8 9. f3 c6 $5 10. Kh1 (10. Be3 d5 11. cxd5
Nxd5 12. Nxd5 cxd5 13. Rc1 a5 $5 {would lead to the amazing masterpiece in
this line (Gustafsson-Kramnik 2012)}) 10... Nh5 11. g4 $5 {White is more or
less obilged to take up the gauntlet as other moves don't offer him anything.}
(11. Be3 f5 {followed by f4.}) (11. f4 Qh4 $1 12. Bxh5 Qxh5 $132) 11... Nf6 (
11... Qf6 {doesn't work due to} 12. Nf5 $1 gxf5 13. gxh5 $16) 12. Bf4 (12. Bg5
h6 13. Bh4 a6 {with a messy position.}) ({Another tempting possibility but for
some reason underrated.} 12. Be3 $5 h5 (12... Qe7 13. Rg1) 13. g5 Nfd7 14. Qd2
Nb6 15. Rfd1 $14) 12... h5 (12... a6 13. Qd2 (13. Rg1 d5) 13... d5 14. e5 Nfd7
15. Bg5 Qc7 16. f4 $16) 13. Nf5 $1 {First introduced in Shomoev-Ganguly
Aeroflot rapid 2013.} ({Always a decent alternative to the h5 idea is} 13. g5
Nh7 14. Qd2 Qe7 (14... Nd7 15. Rad1 Ne5 16. Be3 Bh3 17. Rg1) 15. Rad1 Nd7 {
Black has sufficient counterplay.}) 13... gxf5 14. gxf5 d5 (14... Nbd7 15. Rg1
Kh8 16. Qe1 Ne5 17. Qh4 Nh7 18. Qxh5 Qe7 19. Rg3 {and white soon won in the
origin game of this Nf5 line.}) 15. cxd5 cxd5 16. e5 ({Previously Kovalev had
faced} 16. Rg1 $5 {which should be the real test of this line.} dxe4 (16... Kh8
17. Rxg7 {was the spectacular (Gelfand-Amonatov Oly 2014)}) 17. Nxe4 Qxd1 18.
Nxf6+ Kh8 19. Raxd1 Bxf6 20. Rd6 Nd7 21. Bb5 Rg8 22. Re1 a5 23. Bxd7 Ra6 24.
Rd5 $16 {is clearly better according to comp but looks like Kovalev was
apparently ready to defend this!} (24. Rxf6 Rxf6 25. Bxc8 Rxc8 26. Be5 Rcc6 {
(Zontakh-Kovalev 2014) which eventually ended in a draw.})) 16... Bxf5 17. exf6
Qxf6 {The following sequence is forced for both sides.} 18. Nxd5 Qxb2 19. Ne7+
Rxe7 20. Qd8+ Bf8 ({Kasim-Topy from 2013 continued} 20... Kh7 21. Qxe7 Bg6 {
Here white improved with} 22. Qe8 $1 $16 {(Albornoz-Hernandez 2018)}) 21. Rg1+
Bg4 $1 $146 {Only this is the novelty.} (21... Bg6 22. Bc4 {was a complete
disaster for black in (Landa-Grigoryan 2014)}) 22. fxg4 Nd7 23. gxh5+ Kh8 24.
Qxa8 Rxe2 {Black has enough compensation to hold the balance.} 25. Rae1 (25.
Raf1 Qb5 $1 {[%cal Gb5d5]} 26. Rg2 Qd5 27. Rfg1 Rxg2 28. Rxg2 Qd1+ 29. Rg1 Qf3+
30. Rg2 Qxf4 {Black is the one with chances.}) (25. Rab1 Qd4 26. Qxb7 Qxf4 27.
Rg2 Rxg2 28. Qxg2 Nf6 $132) 25... Rxe1 26. Rxe1 Qf2 27. Bg3 Qf3+ 28. Kg1 Kh7 $1
{I guess black more or less finished the game at home!} 29. Rf1 Bc5+ 30. Bf2
Qg4+ 31. Kh1 Qe4+ 32. Kg1 Qg4+ {An interesting choice followed by deep opening
preparation.If I was to choose someone from the challengers group to make it
to the masters, Kovalev would be my pick! Although I am not entirely ruling
out the leader Chigaev who seems to have finally woken up with a sudden burst
of power and has won three in a row!} 1/2-1/2
