Qc7 9. O-O-O b5 10. a3 Bb7 (10... Be7 {was what MVL played against Wei Yi last
year, and in the Najdorf I just believe whatever the Frenchman decides is best.
}) 11. g4 Rc8 12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. h4 Qb6 (13... Nb6 {was Grischuk-Wang Hao from
2013, a game in which White also won. The computers hate this line for Black
overall though.}) 14. Rh3 h5 15. f5 e5 16. Nb3 hxg4 17. Qxg4 b4 18. axb4 Qxb4 {
Black's structural problems will persist well into an endgame. The question is
how much counterplay he can muster with his pair of bishops and some open files
on the queenside. Black's king, at least for now, is not in danger.} 19. Kb1
Nb6 20. Qe2 Bh6 21. Qf2 Rc6 $6 (21... Na4 22. Nxa4 Qxa4 {was a strong
possiblity, weakening the e4 pawn} 23. Rxd6 $8 Bxe4 24. Bd3 $1 {but White seems
to have the better part of this endgame too. Just imagine a knight installed on
e4 after the trade of bishops...}) 22. Na2 $1 Qa4 23. Rc3 $1 { A good
positional idea. White exchanged the rook on c6, both a powerful attacked an
important defender.} Ke7 24. Rxc6 Qxc6 25. Na5 Qc7 26. Nxb7 Qxb7 27. Nb4 Rb8
28. Qxb6 (28. Bxa6 Qxe4 29. Nd5+ Kf8 30. Nxf6 Qc6 {is winning according to the
engines, but it certainly allows Black counterplay.}) 28... Qxb6 29. Nd5+ Kf8
30. Nxb6 Rxb6 31. c3 {The human solution. This endgame is simply lost: White's
bishop is too powerful, the a-pawn is too weak, the h-pawn is a big problem, f7
is a permanent target.} Be3 32. Kc2 Kg7 33. b4 Kh6 34. Bc4 Bf2 35. Rh1 Rc6 36.
