1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 $1 {A curious moment. Norway Chess have for some
years used a " Confession booth", intended for the players to give messages to
the spectators during the games. Magnus took it a step further: "This is a
small shout-out to Peter Heine, who thought Grischuk would play the Kings
Indian, and not the Grunfeld: Clown!" The Norwegian media, as usual on the
search for stories, took it seriously and as journalistic fairness dictates,
contacted me during the game asking for a rebuttal!} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6.
bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3 c5 8. Rc1 Qa5 {Grischuks stays loyal to his preferred move.} ({
But in the next round Mamedyarov tried} 8... O-O {vs. Magnus both in the
classical and the Armageddon game.} 9. Nf3 Nd7 10. Be2 Qa5 11. O-O Qxa2 12. Nd2
Qa5 13. h4 $5 b5 14. h5 Bb7 15. h6 $1 {was the classical game. I recently
attributed the modern understanding of flank pawn attacks to Alphazero, and
some pointed out to me that opening the h-file and giving mate is not exactly
a new concept in chess! It's a fair point, so this diagram is a good
opportunity to point to what Alphazero has a preference for according to
Sadler and Regan in "Gamechanger": Exactly not going for the direct assualt in
the h-line but instead the slow and more cunning putrting the pawn on h6,
effectively closing the h-line but instead aiming for a slower and more
longterm attack. The benefits are numerous: especially it controls space at
the critical area next to Blacks king, and cramping his defence, like in the
game forcing the bishop to h8 where it blocks the king's potential retreat. As
well in tactical sequences the pawn is only 2 squares from promoting. Not at
all as direct as the typical hxg6 and mate in the h-line, but at times, much
more powerful the game being a good illustration.} Bh8 16. e5 Qc7 17. Bxb5 $1
Bxg2 18. Kxg2 Qb7+ 19. Qf3 Qxb5 20. Rb1 Qa6 21. Ne4 cxd4 22. cxd4 f6 23. Ng5 $1
{The "cramped" nature of Black's kingside is making itself felt with 24.Qd5+
being a deadly threat.} {Mamedyarov succesfully confused with} e6 ({After} 
23... fxg5 24. Qd5+ e6 25. Qxd7 {Blacks position is hopeless with the bishop
on h8 practically being dead due to the pawns on d4, e5 and h6.}) {upon which
Magnus blundered with} 24. Ra1 $2 ({Instead,} 24. Qb7 $1 {would have been
deadly, as after after the exchanges of queens with} Qxb7+ ({If} 24... Qe2 25.
Qxd7 {wins as there is no perpetual after} Qg4+ 26. Kh2 fxg5 27. f3 $1 {
as if Black takes twice on f3, Qxe6+ afterwards forces an eaisly winning
ending, again due to the bishop being locked at h8.}) 25. Rxb7 Nxe5 {there is
the strong} 26. Nxe6 $1) {having missed} 24... Qb6 $1) 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Nf3 Bg4
$5 {Grischuk's pet line, which he used twice at Norway Chess 2014.} 11. d5 {
Karjakin tried 11 Ng5, but Magnus instead follows in the footsteps of Kramnik:}
b5 $1 ({Despite winning the game vs. Kramnik} 11... Nd7 12. c4 Qa3 13. Be2 Bxf3
14. Bxf3 Bd4 $1 {Grischuk decides to avoid Magnus' preparation (!) and springs
his new idea first.}) 12. Be2 ({Critical might be to take the pawn on c5, but
after} 12. Bxc5 Bxf3 13. gxf3 Rc8 14. Bb4 (14. Bd4 Bxd4 15. Qxd4 Nd7 {is just
fine for Black.}) 14... Qc7 {leaves an uncoordinated impression from White, so
Magnus instead reverts to common-sense development}) 12... Nd7 13. O-O Bxf3 $6
{Grischuk after the game said that 11...b5 was old prep and that his
recollection was that the computers back then said Black was better, meaning
he was in "refutation mode", playing principled decisions to expose the flaws
of the white position. Modern engines, however, have modified their views, and
think Black is fine but not more.} 14. Bxf3 {Common sense, but 14.gxf3
followed by either f4, or h4 has definite potential too.} c4 15. Be2 {One does
not have to be Alphazero to suggest 15 h4! here, Stockfish prefers it too!
Magnus, however, goes for first setting up a broad centre, and then develop
his attack on the wing.} (15. h4 $5) 15... Rfd8 $6 {As in move 13, Grischuk is
too colored by the idea of having a good position and thus plays too
ambitiously aiming for rooks on d8 and c8.} (15... Rad8 $1 {however was more
to the point, caring about defensive details like the rook leaving tha
a8-square this not being targeted by a white bishop on f3m but especially
leaving the rook on f8, where it defends the upcoming assult in the f-line, as
well as being ready to counter there itself.} 16. f4 Qa3 17. Bf3 {when now} Nc5
18. e5 f6 $1 {makes a considerable difference to the game.}) 16. f4 $1 Nb6 ({
The big difference now is that} 16... Qa3 17. Bf3 Nc5 18. e5 f6 19. d6 $1 {
hitting a8 is possible, when after} Rac8 20. Bd5+ e6 21. f5 $1 {Whites attack
just crashes through.}) 17. Bf3 Qa3 18. h4 $5 {In a later interview Magnus
mentioned Alphazero and Danil Dubov as his current chess heroes! One does see
the inspiration, with the optimistic and untamed long-term aggression. There
is no immediate threat, and Black's counterplay might even get there first,
but White does aim after the king, and will hit substantially harder than
Black's smaller threats when the attack arrives at the intended target.} e6 (
18... b4 $5 {aims at distracting white immediately, but he will just ignore
with} 19. h5 $1 {as} Bxc3 20. Qf2 {might have won Black a pawn and created two
passed pawns on the queenside, but White couldn't care less as he intends to
finish the game way before such becomes decisive. After} Bg7 21. hxg6 hxg6 {
both} 22. Bg4 ({and} 22. f5 Rf8 23. e5 $5) 22... b3 23. f5 g5 24. f6 exf6 25.
axb3 cxb3 26. Rc7 {gives White a very promising attack.}) 19. h5 $1 Na4 ({
Grischuk's problem is that} 19... exd5 20. e5 $1 {just makes things even worse
as again Black gets an useless extra pawn while speeding up Whites' attack,
with Bd4, f5, Bg4 etc. being the next wave.}) 20. hxg6 {Not h6! this time but
hxg6. Yes, White has thus spent two tempi opening the h-line, apparantly to
little effect!? Partly it does weaken the g6 pawn, later being a subject to a
possible attack, but as we soon will see, the open h-line very much do has
relevance.} hxg6 21. f5 exf5 (21... Bxc3 {obviously is critical, but apart
from just sidestepping with his queen, White has this even mightier exchange
sac:} 22. Rxc3 $1 {when his attack becomes just unstoppable.} Qxc3 23. Qf2 {
Now 24.Bd4 is a deadly threat, and} Qg7 24. fxe6 fxe6 25. Bg4 $1 {highlights
why the h-line being open does make a major difference, with B(x)e6+ followed
by Qh4+ as the deadly threat.}) 22. exf5 Qd6 23. Bf4 Qb6+ 24. Kh1 gxf5 25. d6
$1 {Grischuk staved off immediate defeat, but the next wave of attack he is
helpless against.} Rab8 26. Bd5 Nc5 27. Bg3 Ne6 28. Rxf5 {Now Rxf7 is a threat.
} Rxd6 29. Bxd6 Qxd6 30. Qe3 Qb6 31. Qf3 Rf8 32. Rf1 Nd8 33. Rh5 Qc7 34. Qe4 {
And where fittingly the open h-line gets the final word. Mate on h7 is
unavoidable so Grischuk resigned.} 1-0
