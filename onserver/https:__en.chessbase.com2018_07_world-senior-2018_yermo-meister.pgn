1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 {In my quick preparation I managed to correctly guess the
opening. The question remained which line to play against it.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3
e6 5. Bxc4 c5 6. O-O a6 {[#] An over-the-board decision.} 7. Bd3 $5 ({I
thought Jakob would be prepared to face my usual} 7. Bb3) (7. a4 Nc6 8. Qe2 Qc7
$5) 7... Nc6 ({Just as with the other bishop move the point of an unprovoked
retreat is to meet} 7... b5 {with} 8. a4 $1) 8. Nc3 Qc7 $6 {I don't think this
works as well as in similar lines where White plays a2-a4. However, I wasn't
too surpised with this move. A quick survey of Jakob's games had shown that he
isn't very keen on playing against the IQP, which is rather strange for a QGA
player.} (8... cxd4 9. exd4 Be7 10. Bg5 O-O {is best. Against} 11. Rc1 {
Black can depend on} h6 ({but rather not} 11... Nb4 {as} 12. Bb1 b5 13. a3 Nbd5
14. Nxd5 Nxd5 15. Qd3 g6 16. Bh6 Re8 17. Ne5 Bb7 18. Qf3 Bf6 19. Be4 Qe7 20.
Bxd5 $1 Bxd5 21. Qf4 {brought White success in Giri-Laznicka, 2010 - one of
the early games that showcased an exceptional talent of then 16-year-old
player.}) 12. Bh4 Nh5) 9. Qe2 {I decided to disperse with unnecessary pawn
moves.} ({After the game I learned that} 9. a3 b6 10. dxc5 bxc5 11. Ne4 Be7 12.
Bd2 Bb7 13. Bc3 {was good enough for Kasparov against Kamsky back in 1994})
9... Bd6 $2 {Gifting White another tempo is just too much.} (9... b6 10. Bd2
Bb7 11. Rac1 Be7 12. dxc5 bxc5 13. Ne4 Nd7 14. Bc3 O-O {Sokolov-Wan Vely, 1997.
I have no idea how Loek survived this.}) 10. dxc5 Bxc5 {[#] Look, White took
back on c4 in one move, while the black bishop took two steps, plus the white
queen is better positioned. Add all that up, and White can claim a serious
edge in a symmetrical pawn structure.} 11. Bd2 ({Or} 11. Ne4 {right away.})
11... Bd7 12. Rac1 Bd6 13. Ne4 Nxe4 14. Bxe4 f5 15. Bc2 {Upon seeing f7-f5 I
preferred a slow treatment} ({rather than the hasty} 15. Bxc6 Bxc6 16. e4 fxe4
17. Nd4 Bxh2+ 18. Kh1 Be5 19. Nxc6 bxc6 20. Qxe4 O-O 21. b3 {where White
stands better but may not be able to convert.}) 15... O-O ({During the game I
wondered about} 15... O-O-O $5 {What does Black have to lose anyway?}) 16. Bb3
Rae8 17. Rfd1 Bc8 18. h3 {[#] Another one of those patented Grandmaster
waiting moves. After doing this for 40+ years, it almost becomes you to play
chess like this.} Qe7 19. e4 f4 20. e5 Bb8 21. Qe4 g5 22. Bc3 Qg7 23. Ba4 {
Knowing the game was in hand I let down a bit and missed some tactics 
(fortunately, for myself only)} ({For example,} 23. Bb4 {was there:} Nxb4 (
23... Rf7 24. Rxc6 bxc6 25. Qxc6) 24. Rxc8 Rxc8 25. Bxe6+ Kh8 26. Bxc8) 23...
Kh8 24. Nd4 $1 {[#]} Ne7 {It looks strange, but in reality Black hardly had
any better choices.} (24... Bxe5 25. Nxc6 Bxc3 26. Rxc3 bxc6 27. Qxc6 {catches
the black pieces hampered by a weak back rank:} Bb7 28. Qxe8 Rxe8 29. Bxe8 Bd5
30. Bc6 Qe5 31. Bxd5 exd5 32. Rc5 Qxb2 33. Rdxd5) 25. Bxe8 Rxe8 26. Bb4 {
It's curtains already.} Ng6 (26... Nd5 27. Bd6 Ba7 28. Rxc8 Rxc8 29. Nxe6) 27.
Bd6 ({Once again,} 27. Rxc8 Rxc8 28. Nxe6 Qg8 29. Nxg5 {was there.}) 27... Bd7

I could land my only tactical blow in the game.} (38... a5 39. Re8 {was what I
had in mind.}) 1-0
