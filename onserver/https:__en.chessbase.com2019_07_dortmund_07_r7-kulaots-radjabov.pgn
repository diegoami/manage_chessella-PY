Qd3 d4 15. h6 Rg6 {A typical manoeuvre: the other rook comes to block White's pawns. Now the pair of rooks will make it unlikely for White to hold this pawn.} 16. h7 Rh8 17. Nxd4 Nxd4 18. Qxd4 Bc6 {And also this manoeuvre is well known: Black sacrifices his d-pawn (and possibly also the c-pawn), in order to bring his pieces to better positions.} 19. Bd3 Rxg2 20. Be3 Rg7 21.
