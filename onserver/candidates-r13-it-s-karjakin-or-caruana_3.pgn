1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 $5 {In their previous encounter where Anand had
white, he went for Bb5 and Anish was just impenetrable in the Berlin. It is
a natural choice try the Guioco Piano once again.} Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3
d6 6. c3 a6 7. a4 Ba7 8. Na3 Ne7 {This exact position was reached between
Anand and Aronian in the ninth round. Vishy had now gone Nc2. In this game he
deviates with the more active Bg5.} 9. Bg5 $146 c6 (9... Ng6 {looks like a
natural move. But Giri figures that there is no need to worry about the
doubling of his f-pawns.}) 10. Nc2 O-O 11. Nh4 $6 {Anand goes for this
interesting idea of launching a kingside attack with taking on f6 and
transferring the queen to h5 but this allows his opponent to break in the
centre.} (11. Bxf6 $1 gxf6 12. d4 {looked like a very logical and tempting way
to play for White.} Bg4 13. Bb3 f5 14. exf5 e4 15. Ne3 Bh5 16. g4 $18 {is just
an illustrative line but take on f6 followed by d4 looked pretty strong.})

Bxf3 15. Qxf3 $14) (13... Re8) 14. Re1 {White is posing small problems for his
opponent. This mini problem of defending e5 is not so easy to solve.} Bg4 (
14... Re8 15. d4 $5 e4 (15... exd4 16. Rxe8+ Nxe8 17. Ncxd4 $14) 16. Ne5 {
is some initiative for White}) 15. Bh4 {The bishop plans to go to g3 in order
to increase the pressure on the e5 pawn.} (15. h3 Bh5 16. g4 e4 $1 (16... Bg6

extremely important to open the bishop on a7. Black has a slight edge.} 20. Be2
cxd4 21. Ncxd4 Re4 {White's position is solid enough to withstand the attack
by White. But the ability to improve the situation solely lies in Black's
hands.} 22. Qc2 Rc8 (22... Rfe8 23. Bd3 Rxe1+ 24. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 25. Nxe1 $11) 23.
Rad1 Bxf3 {A highly committal decision by Anish. But it was not for nothing.
He had spotted a tactic. Of course, armed with computers we can immediately
say that the sacrifice was incorrect. However, during the game it looks
extremely tempting.} 24. Nxf3 Bxf2+ $5 {Objectively this is incorrect. But
with the approaching time pressure and also seeing the competitive importance
of the game, this looks like an excellent practical try.} 25. Kxf2 Qb6+ 26. Kf1
(26. Nd4 Rxd4 $17) 26... Nh5 27. g4 $1 {The only way for White to
fight for an advantage. Of course, Anish saw this coming, but in any case
winning two pawns looks like a good bet.} (27. Nd4 Ng3+ 28. Kg1 Rxd4 29. Rxd4
Qxd4+ 30. cxd4 Rxc2 31. Bd3 Rc8 32. Re7) 27... fxg3 (27... Ng3+ 28. Kg2 {
is absolutely nothing.}) 28. Bd3 (28. Rd4 $5 {was the best move and one which
is not at all easy to see.} Rxd4 (28... Rce8 $5 29. Qd2 Nf4 30. Bd3 Rxe1+ 31.
