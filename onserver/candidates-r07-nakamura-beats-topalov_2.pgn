Aronian played this relatively new idea which was tried once before at the top
level by Bruzon Batista against Ruslan Ponomariov in World Cup 2011.} 7. e4 a4
{Gaining further space on the queenside and looking to weaken the dark squared
complex with a4-a3.} 8. a3 c5 9. Re1 Nc6 10. h4 $6 {Karjakin was critical of
this move and said that he should have first closed the centre with e5 before
indulging in this flank move.} (10. e5 Nd7 11. Nf1 {would lead to a normal KIA
position.}) 10... dxe4 $1 {In this structure the move h4 looks a little silly.}
11. Nxe4 (11. dxe4 e5 12. Nc4 Qc7 13. Ne3 Nd4 $11) 11... Nxe4 12. Rxe4 (12.
dxe4 e5 $15) 12... b5 13. Ng5 {And now comes a brilliant move by Levon.} Ra6 $1
{True this might seem as if the rook just defends the c6 knight. But actually
it will be useful for the defense on the kingside on the third rank after e5.}
(13... h6 {looks like a perfectly fine move. But Levon could have been afraid
of} 14. Rxe6 $5 fxe6 15. Bxc6 Ra6 16. Be4 hxg5 17. Qh5 {The position is getting
messy.} Rf5 18. g4 $5 gxh4 19. gxf5 exf5 20. Bxf5 Bxf5 21. Qxf5 Rf6 $17 {It all
ends well for Black but it is not so easy to calculate over the board.} ) 14.

Bf6 {was the best move, keeping control on the e5 square. Of course, Levon saw
this but he thought that Bd7 was smarter.}) 17. Ne5 Nxe5 18. Rxe5 Bd6 19. Re1
Qf6 20. Rb1 $1 {This is why Karjaking is a strong defender. He allows f5-f4 but
makes sure that b2 is defended and that he can exchange his dark squared
bishop.} f4 (20... b4 {Might have kept more pieces in the position and given
Black better chances of exploiting his advantage.}) 21. Bxf4 Bxf4 22. gxf4 Qxf4
23. Qxc5 Rf5 24. Qe3 Qxh4 {This looks scary for White but Karjakin has
everything under control.} 25. Qg3 Qh5 26. Qc7 Qf7 27. Qb7 Rd6 28. Qb8+ Qf8 29.
Qxf8+ Kxf8 30. Re3 Bc6 31. Rbe1 {It was a pity that Levon could not press well
in the slighly better position, but as always Sergey defended really well. }
