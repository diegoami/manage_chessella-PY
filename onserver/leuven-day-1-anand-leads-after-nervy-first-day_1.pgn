d5 $44) 6... d6 7. Nbd2 (7. h3 {had become quite popular during the Candidates
2016.}) 7... Ne7 8. d4 {With the knight protecting the pawn on e4, this pawn on
d4 has to be taken or else e5 falls.} exd4 9. cxd4 Bb6 10. Re1 Bg4 11. h3 Bh5

Ne4 $1 {This is the most natural move. Why then the exclamation? The
exclamation is for allowing Bh6 and seeing that the move is not as strong as it
looks.} 25. Bh6 $5 {If you say A you must say B.} Qc7 $3 {Seriously, this move
is not at all easy to see in limited time. On the surface it doesn't do much.
But if you dig deeper you see that gxh6 is a threat and so is Rxf5 followed by
picking up the bishop. Also Nxf2 followed by the queen coming in is possible.
All in all Queen to c7 is a beautiful move.} 26. Nxg7 (26. Qb3 $1 {is the best
move but is not so easy for humans to find.} Nxf2 (26... gxh6 27. Rxe4 $14) 27.
Kxf2 gxh6 28. Nxh6+ Kh8 29. Nf5 $14 {White is able to retain a small edge.})
(26. Bxg7 {is easily refuted.} Rxf5 27. gxf5 Nf4 $1 $19 {And now the bishop on
g7 is lost with a mate quickly coming up.} (27... Qxg7 $2 28. fxg6 Qxg6+ 29.
Kh2 $1 $16 (29. Kf1 $2 Ng3+ $19))) 26... Nxf2 $1 {A strong sacrifice. The gift
has to be accepted because the queen is threatening to enter g3.} (26... Nf4
27. Bxf4 Qxf4 28. Nf5 $16) 27. Kxf2 Qh2+ 28. Ke3 { And now the queen on h2 is
attacked. Hence something should be done about it.} Qg2 $1 {A quiet move that
not only threatens the f3 knight but also the deadly move Ne5!} (28... Rxf3+
{is possible but after} 29. Kxf3 Qxh3+ 30. Ke2 Qxh6 31. Nf5 $16 {Things are not
so clear.}) 29. Qe2 (29. Nf5 Re8+ $1 $19) (29. Rf1 Ne5 $1 30. Nxe5 Rxf1 $19
{and the black king will not survive for long.}) 29... Rxf3+ $1 30. Qxf3 Bxd4+
