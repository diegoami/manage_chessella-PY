1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 {No Berlin Endgames!} d6 5. c3 g6 6. O-O
Bg7 7. Re1 O-O 8. Nbd2 Bd7 9. Nf1 h6 10. Ng3 {When the pawn is on g6, I often
wonder, what is the use of having the knight on g3. Isn't it just dominated by
the pawn. Well, here perhaps Vetoshko would just like to defend the centre
with his knight and prepare for the d4 break.} Nh7 11. h3 Ng5 12. Nxg5 hxg5 13.
Be3 {White's play has been very simple. Nothing flashy. With normal moves he
has got a very promising position.} Kh7 (13... f5 14. exf5 gxf5 15. Qh5 {
The threat of Bc4 is very strong.} Be8 16. Bxg5 $1 (16. Qxg5 $2 f4 $17) 16...
Bxh5 17. Bxd8 Raxd8 18. Nxh5 $16 {White is a pawn up and has a very nice
position.}) 14. Qd2 Bf6 15. d4 $1 {At the very opportune moment White breaks
in the center.} a6 16. Ba4 b5 17. Bc2 Rh8 18. f3 Kg7 19. d5 Na5 20. b3 {
The pawns on f3 and h3 ensure that there will be no breakthrough on the
kingside. Meanwhile White is all prepared to start his queenside onslaught
with the move a4.} Nb7 (20... Qc8 {With the idea of sacrificing a piece on h3
is not too threatening.} 21. c4 Bxh3 22. gxh3 (22. Qxa5 $6 Bxg2 $1 $13) 22...
Qxh3 23. Qg2 $1 $18 {And the attack will be pushed back.}) 21. b4 $1 {Of
course, the knight is dominated and a4 is coming up.} a5 22. Reb1 c5 (22... a4
23. Bd3 Qe8 24. c4 $18 {White has a decisive positional advantage.}) 23. dxc6
Bxc6 24. Bb3 Rc8 25. a4 $1 {All thematic moves by Vetoshko.} Qc7 (25... bxa4
26. Bxa4 Bxa4 27. Rxa4 axb4 28. cxb4 $18 {The passed b-pawn coupled with the
poor bishop on f6 gives White a winning position.}) 26. axb5 Bxb5 27. bxa5 Nxa5
28. Bxf7 $1 {A simple tactic and White wins a pawn.} Bc4 (28... Qxf7 29. Rxa5
$1 $18 (29. Rxb5 Nc4 $1 $16 (29... Nb3 30. Rxb3 Qxb3 31. Ra7+ Kg8 32. Qxd6 $18)
)) 29. Bd5 $1 Rb8 30. Rxb8 Rxb8 31. Rxa5 (31. Bxg5 {was the cleaner way to
finish the game.} Nb3 32. Bxf6+ Kxf6 33. Qh6 Nxa1 34. Nh5+ Ke7 35. Qg7+ {
And that's game over.}) 31... Qxa5 32. Bxc4 Rc8 33. Qd5 $5 {Volodymyr believes
in the strength of his minor pieces. He exchnges the queens and also gives up
one of his pawns.} Qxd5 34. Bxd5 Rxc3 35. Nf1 {Now this position should not be
too difficult to win because the g5 pawn is weak. If instead of pawns being
doubled on g-file, they were on g6 and h7, the technical task would have been
much more difficult.} Bd8 36. Bf2 Rc1 37. Be3 Rb1 38. Kf2 Bb6 39. Bxb6 Rxb6 {
White will place his knight on c4 and attack the d6 pawn. He will then bring
his king to g4 and keep an eye on the g5 pawn. Slowly, he will bring his
knight to e6 to attack the g5 pawn. All this will take time, but is not so
difficult to execute as Black is left without counterplay.} 40. Ne3 Kf6 41. Nc4
Ra6 42. Kg3 Ke7 43. Kg4 Ra2 44. g3 Rg2 {This is the point where Vetoshko
struck the nice plan of Na3-b5-c7-e6 winning the pawn and the game.} 45. Na3 $1
(45. Kxg5 $2 Rxg3+ $11) 45... Rg1 46. Nb5 Rg2 (46... Kd7 47. Bf7 Ke7 48. Bxg6
$18) 47. Nc7 Rg1 48. Ne6 Rg2 49. Nxg5 {White has won the g5 pawn and will now
expand on the kingside.} Rg1 50. h4 Rg2 51. Ne6 Kf6 52. Nd8 Rg1 53. Nb7 Ke7 54.
Na5 Rg2 55. Nc4 Rg1 56. f4 $1 {The final breakthrough.} exf4 57. Kxf4 Rf1+ 58.
Kg5 Rg1 59. g4 Rg3 60. Nd2 Rg2 61. Nb3 {Methodical is the right word when you
see this game. A very consistent game by Vetoshko without any errors.} 1-0
