{How would you continue with Black?} 32... Bb3 {was played and with seconds on
the clock, I realized I was lost. Still, what should I do to get some sort of
practical chances for a draw? Exchange the bishops or not?} 33. Bxb3 {is what I
opted for} (33. Bf3 {doesn't look brighter either} b4 34. Ke3 c4 35. Kd2 c3+
36. bxc3 (36. Kc1 bxa3 37. bxa3 Kd6 $19) 36... bxa3 37. Kc1 Kc5 $19) 33... axb3
34. Ke5 f6+ {my opponent was also under time pressure - making critical
decisions when your clock is ticking is hard} (34... c4 {would have won on the
spot, almost.} 35. Kd4 Kd6 36. a4 Kc6 $1 ({from afar I thought Black should
play} 36... bxa4 37. Kxc4 Ke5 38. Kb4 {and with the seconds disappearing, when
I exchanged the bishops on b3, I concluded I will sort of survive, I should
have enough tempi. It wouldn't have been the case had he played those precise
moves.} Kxe4 39. Kxa4 Kf4 40. Kxb3 f5 41. Kc3 Kg3 42. b4 Kxg2 43. b5 f4 44. b6
f3 45. b7 f2 46. b8=Q f1=Q {I should survive this but you never know. However,
why would Black go into such a line when he had better?}) 37. e5 Kb6 38. Kc3
Ka5 39. axb5 Kxb5 40. Kd4 Kb4 $19 {White ran out of moves.}) 35. Kxf6 c4 36. e5
c3 37. e6 cxb2 38. e7 b1=Q {the most natural continuation but this allowed me
to breath again} (38... Kd7 {is the precise route, forcing White to play} 39.
Kf7 b1=Q 40. e8=Q+ Kd6 41. Qe7+ Kd5 42. Qd8+ Kc5 $19 {and now White is unable
to deliver perpetual. I believe Black should be winning as its king can hide on
the long run somewhere on the a-file.}) 39. e8=Q+ Kc5 40. Qe7+ {draw offer
accepted. Had Black continued} Kd4 41. Qe5+ Kc4 42. Qc7+ Kd4 (42... Kd3 $4 43.
Qh7+) 43. Qe5+ {a draw by repetition would have been anyway the final outcome.}
