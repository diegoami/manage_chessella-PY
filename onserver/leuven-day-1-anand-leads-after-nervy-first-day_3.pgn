1. Nf3 d5 2. c4 d4 3. b4 {The knight controls the e5 square and the b4 pawn
controls c5. White wants to surround the d4 pawn with Bb2 and win it.} f6 { The
e5 pawn is coming to the rescue!} 4. e3 e5 5. c5 {Protecting the b4 pawn and
opening up the g8-a2 diagonal for the queen and the bishop.} a5 6. Qa4+ Bd7 7.
b5 Bxc5 {Black has won a pawn and his position looks pretty good, but White has
some excellent compensation on the light squares.} 8. Bc4 Bg4 $4 {It is not
everyday that you see Vishy blundering a piece on the ninth move.} (8... Ne7
{Looks like the most natural move.} 9. exd4 exd4 10. Bb2 Bg4 11. Nxd4 Nd7 { And
the knight goes to b6 with an unclear position.}) 9. Bxg8 $1 Nd7 {The only
thing that we can learn from Vishy is how to recover after such a blunder and
not let it affect the game.} (9... Rxg8 10. Qc4 $18 {With a double attack on g8
and c4.}) 10. Qb3 Qe7 11. Bc4 a4 12. Qc2 O-O-O 13. O-O (13. Qxa4 Kb8 $16) 13...
Bxf3 14. gxf3 Nb6 15. d3 f5 16. e4 f4 {The position is shut down and it is not
so easy to win immediately but sooner or later White should manage to
breakthrough using his extra piece.} 17. Kh1 Rd6 18. Rg1 Rh6 19. Nd2 Rf8 20.
Nf1 Kb8 21. Bd2 Rh3 22. Be6 Rxf3 23. Kg2 Re3 $5 {What resourceful play by
Anand!} 24. Bg4 (24. fxe3 dxe3 25. Bg4 exd2 26. Nxd2 h5 $16 {is quite messy.})
24... f3+ 25. Kh1 Re2 26. Rg3 Rxf2 27. Kg1 Rg2+ 28. Rxg2 fxg2 29. Ng3 g6 30.
Kxg2 h5 31. Be2 Bb4 32. Rf1 Bxd2 33. Qxd2 Rxf1 34. Nxf1 Qc5 {White's main
problem is that his minor pieces have no real good outposts to sit on.} 35. Qb2
a3 36. Qb3 Qc1 37. Bd1 Nc8 38. Qc2 Qa1 39. Qd2 Nd6 40. b6 cxb6 41. Bb3 Qb2 42.

Ka6 55. Qd6+ Ka7 56. Qc5+ Ka6 57. Qd6+ {While losing a piece on the ninth move
is nothing to proud of, the way he fought back was quite commendable.} 1/2-1/2
