1. c4 {This was the third white game for Peter in the event. In the first one
he opened with 1.e4, while against Aronian he went 1.c4. Today he repeats the
English Opening.} c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 {Fabiano has
had good success with black in this line, most notable being his win against
Topalov from the 2014 Sinquefield Cup.} 6. Bg2 g6 7. Ng5 $5 {This has been
played in eight encounters before this game, with the top game being Wang Yue
vs Ian Nepomniachtchi. But that was only a blitz.} (7. Ne4 {was an interesting
knight sortie tried in Li Chao vs Peter Leko.}) 7... e6 8. d3 (8. Nge4 Be7 9.

bxc3 Bxc3+ 12. Bd2 Bxa1 13. Qxa1 O-O 14. h4 $5 {Even though White is an
exchange down and has no pawns to show for it, he has good compensation thanks
to the dark square weaknesses in Black's position.}) 10. h4 (10. Nxc5 Nxc3 11.

conference, this was not the most accurate move.} (10... f5 11. Nxc5 Nxc3 12.

White.} f5 13. Nxd5 exd5 14. Nc3 Be6 15. hxg6 f4 $17) (10... h6 11. Nxc5 Nxc3

was necessary but to give the knight on e4 a permanent outpost is not something
that Black would like to do voluntarily.}) 13. Bh6 Nxc3 {Here Svidler thought
for 20 minutes, trying to understand whether he should take back with the pawn
or the knight.} (13... f5 {wouldn't make much sense as after } 14. Bxg7 Kxg7

Bxh3 $16 {And there we have it. Svidler has a technically better â€“ and you can
even go to the extent of saying close to winning position. But the problem with
facing guys like Caruana is that they defend staunchly and never really give
up.} Nc4 29. Rxa7 e5 30. Bg2 (30. Ra4 $1 Ne3 (30... Nd6 31. Ra6 $16 ) (30... b5

here.} 36. e4 $6 (36. Rb7 Rf6 37. e4 Kf8 38. e5 Re6 39. Ke4 $18 { with complete
domination.}) 36... Ng3 37. e5 Rf3+ 38. Kc4 Ne4 {Things have already started

in a draw.}) 43... c3 44. Rc7 g5 45. Bxe4 {Peter calls it a day. It was really
a close call for the American GM, who is having a real topsy turvy tournament.}
