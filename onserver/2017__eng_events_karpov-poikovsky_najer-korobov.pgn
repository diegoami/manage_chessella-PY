a6 9. dxc5 Nxc5 10. O-O-O Qa5 11. Kb1 b5 {[#]} 12. h4 {Interestingly, this
line of the French doesn't normally see the pawns pushed just yet. Grandmaster
play has preferred Bd3, Nd4, or Ne2. One of the reasons is that Black has not
committed to castling just yet, and White prefers to complete his development
and arrange for defense if need be. Black can get a mean attack going very
quickly if White is too carefree.} (12. Bd3 Bd7 13. Bxc5 Bxc5 14. f5 Bb4 15.

14. Ne2 Ne4 15. Qe1 Rb8 16. Nc1 Nc3+ {[#] This probably came as no surprise
and was possibly even still within White's preparation. It looks scary, but
since one of Black's rooks is still stuck on h8, he should not have enough to
break White's position.} 17. bxc3 bxc3+ 18. Nb3 Rxb3+ $1 {The best move, and
one that an attacking player such as Korobov is unlikely to miss.} 19. axb3 (
