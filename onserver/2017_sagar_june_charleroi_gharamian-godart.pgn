1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 {Godart loves the French Defence.} 3. Nd2 c5 4. Ngf3 cxd4 5.
Nxd4 Nc6 6. Bb5 Bd7 7. Nxc6 bxc6 8. Bd3 Bd6 9. Qe2 Qb8 {Although the move is
pretty weird, it has been seen in four games before.} 10. Nf3 Ne7 11. e5 Bc7 12.
O-O Ng6 13. Re1 O-O 14. Ng5 {Until now we had been following the game Thomas
Luther vs Ekaterina Jussupow. This is the first new move of the game. White is
basically trying to provoke a weakness on Black's kingside.} Qe8 15. Bd2 (15.
Qh5 h6 16. Nxf7 $2 Qxf7 17. Bxg6 Qxf2+ $19) 15... h6 16. Nf3 c5 {Black seems
to have a pretty fine postion out of the opening.} 17. b4 $5 {An interesting
concept by Tigran. In one move, he is trying to activate his dark squared
bishop and also secure the d4 square for his knight.} Qe7 (17... c4 $5 18. Bxg6
fxg6 {It's important to assess this position correctly, if you have to make
the move ...c4 as Black. It turns out that Black is doing fine here and
although White has a grip on the dark squares, Black can play around it and
have no real issues.} 19. Nd4 g5 $15) 18. bxc5 Qxc5 19. h4 Rab8 20. h5 Ne7 21.
Rec1 Rb2 22. Be3 Qa5 23. Bd4 {[%csl Gd3,Gd4,Gf3] This is one thing I like
about strong players. They always get their pieces to the best squares. The
only thing left on White's agenda is to engineer the c4 breakthrough.} Rbb8 24.
c4 Nc6 (24... Bb6 $5) 25. cxd5 exd5 {Everything looks good for White except
for the part that the knight on c6 is going to take the beautiful d4 bishop.
Well, for Tigran this was enough to get rid of the pesky knight from the board!
} 26. Rxc6 $5 {objectively does not give White a winning position, but puts
Black in a very precarious situation. He has to find all the accurate moves,
which is not an easy task.} Bxc6 27. Rc1 (27. e6 {was also an interesting
option, but Black is better after} Bb5 28. e7 Rfe8 29. Bxb5 Qxb5 $19) 27... Bb5
28. Bxb5 {Now the queen cannot take, as the c7 bishop would hang.} Rxb5 29. e6 {
One bishop on d3 has been exchanged, but the bishop on d4 is quite strong and
the knight will enter f5 via h4. It looks like White has great compensation.}
Rbb8 {Godart finds the most tenacious defence.} 30. e7 (30. exf7+ Rxf7 31. Qe6
Rbf8 32. Bxg7 Kxg7 33. Qg6+ Kh8 34. Qxh6+ Kg8 35. Qg6+ $11) 30... Rfe8 31. Nh4
{[%cal Gf3h4] This is the position which we have given as a test for you.
White is threatening Nf5 and things could become really dangerous for Black
after that. So what would you do here?} Bf4 $6 {This is a human move, that
attacks the c1 rook and prepares Bg5, blocking moves like Qg4. However, Black
had something better at his disposal than this.} (31... Qb4 $1 {Now this move
attacking the d4 bishop was seen by both the players and they both rejected it
because of the simple Nf5. However, it turns out that Black has a winning move!
} 32. Nf5 Qb1 $3 {Not at all easy to see this double attack! The rook on c1 is
hanging and so is the knight on f5 and there is simply no way to defend both
of them.} 33. Nxh6+ {Only way to continue the game.} Kh7 $1 (33... gxh6 34.
Qg4+ $18) 34. Qf1 Qe4 $17 {White has lost all his coordination and Black is
just dominating.}) 32. Rd1 $1 Qc7 33. Nf5 Bg5 34. Be5 (34. Bxg7 $44 {was
pretty strong and would have given White a strong attack.}) 34... Qd7 (34...
Qc4 $5 35. Qxc4 dxc4 36. Bxb8 Rxb8 37. f4 Bf6 38. Rd7 $14 {White is pushing
here.}) 35. Qg4 Kh7 36. Bxb8 Rxb8 37. Nxh6 (37. Qf3 $1 {As rightly pointed by
Tigran was a strong move with the very nice point that after} Bxe7 {White has
the strong} 38. Nxg7 $1 $16 {And the knight cannot be taken because of Qg3+} (
38. Qg3 $6 Rg8 $13)) 37... Qxe7 (37... Qxg4 38. Nxg4 Bxe7 39. Rxd5 $14 {
Black should have tried to hold this endgame. Not a fun task, but chances are
not bad.}) 38. Nxf7 Qxf7 39. Qxg5 Rb2 40. f3 Rxa2 41. Qxd5 {Tigran calculates
that this endgame with 3 vs 1 on the same side is winning for him.} Qxd5 42.
Rxd5 Kh6 43. Kh2 a5 44. Kh3 a4 45. Ra5 Rb2 46. g4 Rb3 47. Kg3 a3 48. Ra6+ Kh7
49. g5 Rb1 50. Rxa3 Rh1 51. Kg4 Rg1+ 52. Kf5 Rg3 53. Rb3 {A very interesting
and rich struggle.} 1-0
