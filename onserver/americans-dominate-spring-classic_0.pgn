Nb5 Nxc2+ 16. Ke2 {Surprisingly, this craziness had all been played before!}
axb5 $5 {Did Ruifeng not know theory or did he just choose to go for a more
risky route?} (16... Qc6 {was Sadzikowski-Areschenko from August of last year
and Karjakin-Mamedov from Shamkir}) 17. Rxa8+ Ke7 18. Rxh8 Nxe3 {How rare to
see this in Chess. White is up two exchanges right now, but will iwn another
knight, yet the position is unclear!} 19. Kxe3 Qc5+ 20. Ke2 (20. Kd3 e4+ {
could be the subject of a whole article in itself.}) 20... Ne4 21. Qd3 Qf2+ $2

22. Kd1 Nxg3 23. f6+ $1 {A very important detail, this takes away f6 from the
king} gxf6 24. Qd5 $2 (24. Qxb5 {immediately was winning} f5 25. Qxb7+ Kf6 26.

had to return to the defense} e4 $1 28. Rd8 $1 $13) 27... Kd4 28. Qa7+ Bc5 29.
Rd8+ Ke4 30. Qb7+ Kf4 31. Kc1 Qe1+ $1 32. Kc2 f5 $1 {Black wants to allow no
possibilities of a counterattack on the king. Pushing the f-pawn helps take
control of key squares} 33. b4 {The final mistake} (33. Rxf1+ Qxf1 34. Qxf7
