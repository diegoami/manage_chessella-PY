1. e4 {(0) It is funny how both leaders played their best game of the two
rounds in the sixth round.} e6  2. d4  d5  3. Nc3  Nf6  4. Bg5  dxe4 $5 {(55)
An interesting choice by Howell.} 5. Nxe4  Be7  6. Nxf6+ {(3:19) It seems that
the Ukrainain GM, who is known for his aggressive style, was caught offguard.
Thus, Onischuk goes for a less common line.} (6. Bxf6 gxf6 {is considered the
mainline. However, Onischuk may have not been prepared against Bxf6.}) 6...
Bxf6  7. Bxf6  Qxf6  8. Nf3  O-O  9. Qd2  c5 $1 {(21:31) This is a mainline and
equalizer. Could it be that Howell wanted more complications?} 10. O-O-O  Rd8 
11. Qc3  cxd4 {(20:47) another long pause for a well-known forced line.} 12.
Rxd4  Rxd4  13. Qxd4  Qxd4  14. Nxd4 {[#] (1:00) This is a completely equal
endgame. The way the British GM outplays his strong opponent reminds one of
Capablanca's victories. Either it was bad day at the office for the Ukrainian
or a Magnus-like performance from Howell. Either way this game is a great
example and worthy of a texbook lesson!} b6  15. Be2  Bb7  16. Nb5  Nd7  17.
Rd1  Nf6  18. f3 {(1:23) This is an ugly move and a bad sign. I would rather
play g3 and keep my pawns on the squares that do not restrict my bishop.} Kf8 
19. c4  Ke7  20. Kd2  g5 $1 {(3:00) A great move by Howell. This is a typical
move that every coach shows to their students. Black is trying to undermine
White's pawn structure with g4. Another reason why f3 was not necessary.} 21.
Ke3  Bc6  22. Nc3  a5 $1 {(1:26) A great prohylactic move which costs White
more moves to create a mobile majority. It is noteworthy to see that a3 will be
faced with a4.} 23. b3  h6  24. a3  Ne8 $1 {( 01:45) Another excellet idea by
Howell. The knight is going to d6 from where it can support Black's kingside
majority.} 25. g4 {(10:36) Tactically sound but still very ugly! Do not put
your pawns on the same color as your bishop in the endgame!} Nd6  26. f4  Rc8 
27. Rc1  f5 $1 {(1:49) Now the situation is critical and only accurate play can
give White a draw.} 28. h3  Kf6  29. Rd1 $2 {(2:48) A surprising losing
blunder.} (29. fxg5+ hxg5 30. gxf5 exf5 31. Bf3 {was needed and White should
sit tight and prepare to defend a probable rook and pawn endgame with a pawn
down but where a draw is still very much a conceivable outcome.}) 29... gxf4+ 
30. Kxf4  e5+  31. Ke3  f4+ {(30) Now Black's central pawns are unstoppable.
The game is decided both practically and scientifically! } 32. Kf2  Ke6  33.
Nd5  Ne4+  34. Ke1  Bxd5  35. Rxd5  Nc3  36. Bd3  e4  37. Rd4  Ke5  38. Rd7 
Ke6  39. Rd4  Ke5  40. Rd7  exd3  41. Rxd3  Nb1  42. a4  Ke4  43. Rd1  Nc3  44.
Rd6  Ke3 {( 08) A lesson for all of us: Never play outside your element.
Vladimir Onischuk is an ultra-sharp player with an aggressive style with both
colors. That is what he is good at. By choosing a calm position against David
Howell, he just got himself into a wrong psychological battle where he had to
play against his own preference. More experienced and more universal, Howell on
the other hand exploited every small mistake by Onischuk to score a crucial
victory with black.} 0-1
