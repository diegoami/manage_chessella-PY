28. Nc7 $2 ({during the game, I was a little worried about} 28. Bxc6 bxc6 29.
Nd4 Rc8 {is a position with play for both sides} ({engine's suggestion} 29...
e3 {is also interesting} 30. Nxc6 Qe8 31. fxe3 Ra6 32. Rxf6 Bxf6 33. Nd4 Qxe3+

the game})) 28... Rc8 29. Ne6 (29. Bxc6 bxc6 30. Na6 f4 {[%csl Ra6] Black has
the initiative}) 29... f4 $2 ({I had some time to think about} 29... Bxd5 $1
30. R1xd5 Rxe6 31. Rxe5 {the move I actually missed was} Rxd6 ({I only saw} 
31... Rxe5 $2 {which is just bad for Black}) 32. f4 $1 {is difficult to find} (
32. Qb1 $2 Rd2 33. Re6 (33. Re7 $2 Rcd8 $19) 33... Rxc5 $19 {is winning for
Black} (33... Rcd8 $4 34. Rd6 $11)) 32... Rd7 {Black is better. On the 29th
move I thought that saving time for the upcoming moves was better and I did
not consider Bxd5 much}) 30. Qb3 $2 (30. Bxc6 bxc6 31. Nxg7 Kxg7 32. Rd7+ Kh8 {
+/-/+/=}) 30... e3 $1 {I was thinking less and just pushing pawns} 31. Bxc6

should have avoided Black's f3 and gone for equality with 35.Qc2} 35. Qb7+ $2 (

}) 36. Qxc6 $4 (36. Qb3 {recognising the mistake and coming back was the best}

just losing for White} 37. Qd6 ({if} 37. gxf3 Qg5+ 38. Kh1 Qd2 39. Rg1 e1=Q 40.
