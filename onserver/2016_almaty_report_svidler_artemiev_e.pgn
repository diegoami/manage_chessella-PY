a Blitz game but that is a wrong approach!} 37. Bf3 {leading to a very
interesting endgame, where domination of bishop vs knight plays the key role.}

stable.} (39. Bxa6 {is not working because of} f5 $1 {I know this looks
anti-positional but placing your pawns on the colour of the opposition bishop
is a good way to limitate its area of activity. And that would bring a
precious half a point too.})) 38. Bd5 $1 {keeping an eye on both b7 and f7
pawns.} Ke7 39. Kf1 (39. e4 $1 {Controlling the crucial square f5, thus

deserve attention.} 1-0
