{US playing China on top board at the final round of Olympiad was definitely
the biggest match to look forward. On top board there was Caruana with white
pieces who is in amazing form. He was facing the super solid Ding Liren who
did not lose a single game for last 14 months!} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6
4. e3 Bb4 5. Qc2 Bxc3 6. Qxc3 Qe7 {Just one day before Fabiano had this
position as black! Today Ding decided to play this as black against Fabiano
himself! That was a very interesting psychological thinking. Probably this was
the last opening that Fabiano thought Ding might play.} 7. d4 Ne4 8. Qd3 exd4
9. Nxd4 O-O 10. Be2 Qb4+ 11. Kf1 Qe7 12. f3 f5 $5 {Less popular than the main
move 12...Nc5 but it is not easy to catch Fabiano off-guard.} (12... Nc5 {
Was seen in Duda - Caruana just one day before this game.}) 13. Qd1 {Played
absolutely instantly.} Nc5 {Ding started to think from hereon.} 14. Kf2 d6 {
Only after this move did Fabi start to think.} (14... b6 {There is a
correspondence game which went this way. I assume Fabiano knew this or had
seen this day before while preparing as black. Clearly, he didn't mind to
enter the same line as white and perhaps had some improvement somewhere.} 15.

Ra7 {I don't understand much of correspondence games but this is how it was
played and black drew this game. To me it looks slightly better position for
white. ½-½ (42) Säuberli,G (2364)-Hyldkrog,L (2433) ICCF 2017}) 15. Re1 (15.
Rf1 {In hindsight it is easier to say that rook on f1 was perhaps a better
choice in order to stop any kind of kingside attack as both Qe1 and Rf2 will
be available if needed.} Qh4+ (15... Ne5 16. Kg1 a5 17. b3 {position remains
balanced with a long game ahead. I personally like white's position more.}) 16.
Kg1 Rf6 {This doesn't make any sense with the rook on f1} 17. Nxc6 bxc6 18. Rf2
$14) 15... Qh4+ 16. Kg1 Rf6 $1 {Ding didn't miss the momentum and immediately
launched at attack on kingside. Now with the rook on e1 white is not on time
to consolidate.} 17. g3 (17. Nxc6 Rh6 $1 18. Ne7+ Kh8 19. h3 Qg3 {forces
perpetual} 20. b4 (20. Kh1 Rxh3+ 21. gxh3 Qxh3+ $11) 20... Rxh3 $1 21. Bf1 Rh2

Qd4 (23. fxe4 $4 Qh4 $19) 23... Rh1+ 24. Kxh1 Nf2+ 25. Kg1 Nh3+ $11 {One of
the few spectacular lines available.}) (17. Bf1 $6 Rh6 18. h3 Bd7 {Doesn't
feel right at all for white.}) 17... Rg6 18. Nxc6 {Right decision to bailout.}

It was a grea boost for Chinese team when Ding almost effortlessly managed to
hold against Fabiano as black.} 1/2-1/2
