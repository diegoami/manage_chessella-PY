{This game will certainly be included in many strategy books that will be
printed in the future. I am sure you have seen it all over the chess news but
probably one move later, when in fact the whole point starts here:} 12. exd5 $1
{Many players would have probably not gone for this exchange in the center,
hadn't they seen What Eljanov saw. More 'natural' are continuations like 12.
Re1 or 12.c3 or 12.Qe2, which were one by one disregarded by the Ukrainian GM.
Starting with 12.exd5, he saw White's potential in hitting on the vulnerable
white squares, since the black bishop is dearly missed on e6.} cxd5 13. Nb1 $1
{Chapeau! Moving backwards is against the human nature, making such moves
incredibly difficult to find and play. But once you see it... This was Pavel's
favourite moment in the tournament, which will always bring a smile on his
face.} Bb4 {Trying to prevent White from jumping on c3, thus indirectly
protecting the d5 pawn. Temporarely.} 14. c3 Bd6 15. Na3 Bxa3 16. Rxa3 Rc8 17.

{Winner's luck?! Whichever side you are on, luck or no luck, one thing is clear
to me: these top players are too objective. They immediately tell you: I was
worse here, I was better there, with no euphoric or depressing feelings
clouding their judgement. Respect.} 43... a6 {Following the rule of thumbs in
the endgame: the side which is defending should search for simplifications,
exchanging the remaining pawns and liquidating into an easier position to
protect. Not this time.} ({The more active defense was:} 43... Kd4 44. Rd3+

Tough players stand up after a defeat and continue as if nothing happened!

eventually.} 1-0
