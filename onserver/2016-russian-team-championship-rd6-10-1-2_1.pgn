56... Nc4 57. Bf4 ({The great champion missed} 57. f6 $1 {not once, but twice.}
Ne5 58. Bf4 Nf7 59. Kg6 Nh8+ {No need to be a grandmaster to see that disaster
is but a knock away.} 60. Kh5 $1 {Zugzwang! (Kf5 also wins but one has to love
a nice zuzgzwang position)} Nf7 61. Rb8+ Bf8 62. Rxb2 {Resistance is futile.})
57... Na5 58. Rb6 Nc6 59. Rb3 Kf7 60. Bg5 Nb4 61. f6 $4 {This is about as
ironic as chess gets. Four moves ago, 57.f6! was the killer blow, but here it
throws away the win and is the drawing move.} (61. Kg4 $1 {would still have won
the game for White.} Nc6 (61... Ke8 62. f6 Nc6 63. Bd2 Kf7 64. Kf5 Kg8 65. Ke4
{and the king plays a decisive role.}) 62. Rb7+ Ke8 63. f6 Nd8 64. Rb3 Nc6 65.
Bd2 {and the white king now marches all over to pick up the pawns with
Kf5-e4-xd4, etc.}) 61... Nd5 62. Rb7+ Ke6 63. f7 Bb4 $1 {cutting off the rook
from the pawn and forcing} 64. f8=Q Bxf8 65. Rxb2 Nc3 {and try as he may (and
he spent 70 moves trying!), Kramnik was unable to trip Karjakin, and they drew
after 138 moves.} 1/2-1/2
