{Of course analyzing in depth Blitz games makes little sense but I like to
point out some tough decisions that were taken within seconds. And that I
respect a lot, like the positional sacrifice from this game, for example!} 
23... Nh5 {Cold-blooded positional sacrifice} 24. Bxd8 Rxd8 25. Rg4 c4 {
Black's counterplay is in fact looking quite promising, whereas White's
perspectives are not that obvious...} 26. Qg2 b3 {aggressive and rather good
for a Blitz game but objectively speaking...it was not the most recommended
continnuation.} (26... a4 {was the more restrained and even 'cooler' move, to
prepare the attack.}) 27. Rg5 {not so precise, allowing Black to continue its
conquering business on the queenside.} (27. cxb3 {was the way to go, but who
can blame someone for not wanting to open up the king like that?} cxb3 28. axb3
{and White has the upper hand.}) 27... bxa2+ 28. Ka1 Nf4 (28... c3 {was even
stronger, blowing up the shelter of the white king.}) 29. Nxf4 exf4 30. c3 a4 {
If you check with a computer the rest of the game you will get some EKG
diagram, which is rather normal for a Blitz game. However, the level for such
circumstances remains insanely high...} 31. h5 a3 32. hxg6 axb2+ 33. Qxb2 f5
