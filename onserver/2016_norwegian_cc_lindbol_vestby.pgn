18. Nd2 Nxf2 $1 {A great sacrifice reminiscent of the great Bobby Fischer´s
classical combination against Robert Byrne in the US Championships (1963/64).}
19. Kxf2 Ba6 $1 {The white queen is drawn away from the protection of her
Majesty. This second piece sacrifice can´t be accepted and black wins easily.
But what a beautiful mate it would have been if white was to take on a6.} 20.
Nc4 (20. Qxa6 Qxe3+ 21. Kf1 Ng4 22. Qe2 Nxh2+ 23. Ke1 Qxg3#) 20... dxc4 21.
bxc4 Bxc4 $1 {The bishop is on a rampage and can´t be taken now either.} 22.
Qd2 Ng4+ 23. Kg1 Qxe3+ 24. Qxe3 Nxe3 25. Rd2 Nxg2 $1 26. Kxg2 cxd4 27. Rxd4 Be6
{And with an active bishop pair and two pawns up, Mads didn´t have any
problems converting his advantage.} 0-1
