Nd4 Bxg2 16. Kxg2 Qb7+ 17. f3 g5 $6 {This weakening of the position is a bit
too ambitious.} (17... Ng6 $1 18. Be3 {what else?} d5 {was a better way to
achieve the break that Kramnik wanted. Black is slightly better already, as
White has some problems down the d-file and with Ba3 coming.}) 18. Be3 d5 19.
Bxg5 $1 {Svidler is quick to pick up the gauntlet. This is the only reaction
that White truly has against the break in the center.} hxg5 20. Qxg5+ Ng6 21.
Nxe6 {The point, really. White has netted three pawns for the piece, but also
Black's king is a bit loose and his coordination has suffered because of it.}
Rd6 22. Nf4 Ne4 23. Qg4 Nxc3 (23... Nf6 24. Qf5 {allows White to keep up the
pressure.}) 24. Rxc3 d4 25. Rcd3 Rad8 $6 (25... Qc8 {it was probably time to
trade the queens. Black will lose d4 anyway.}) 26. Nd5 Bf8 27. Rxd4 Bg7 28.
R4d2 (28. Nf6+ $6 Bxf6 29. Rxd6 Rxd6 30. Rxd6 Qe7 31. Rd2 Qe3 32. Rc2 Bd4 {
looks like it gives Black enough counterplay to hold the game.}) 28... b5 29.
Qe4 Qb8 30. c5 Re8 31. Qg4 (31. Qxe8+ $1 Qxe8 32. cxd6 Qd7 33. Nc7 $1 {In time
pressure it is difficult ot assess a position like this, but Black should be
lost here. The rooks are dangerously close to coordinating in such a way to
kick the blockader from d7 and push the pawn, while Black has no real
counterplay.}) 31... Rde6 32. e4 Qc8 33. Rc2 Ne5 34. Qf5 Qb7 35. f4 {Perhaps
not a bad move, but very committal in a time trouble situation.} (35. h4 $1 $16
) 35... Nc6 36. e5 Nb4 37. Rcd2 f6 {Risky, but in time trouble it makes sense
to make the position explode.} 38. Qe4 (38. Kh3 $1 {A crazy move to play in
time trouble, but the point is that after the forced} Nxd5 39. Rxd5 {Black
cannot play fxe5} fxe5 40. Rd7 {with Qf7+ winning. The Rh6+ does little after
Kg4.}) 38... Nxd5 39. Rxd5 fxe5 40. f5 Ra6 41. R1d2 $16 {Things are not so easy
anymore, but we have crossed the 40th move and time control was reached.} Kh8
42. h4 Rh6 43. Kf3 $2 (43. b4) 43... Rh5 $1 44. Qg4 $6 (44. Rxe5 Qxe4+ 45. Rxe4
Rxf5+ 46. Kg4 Rfe5 $1 {is close to a draw.}) 44... Rxf5+ $1 45. Qxf5 Rf8 46.
Qxf8+ Bxf8 {With White's queen off the board, perhaps Black can even think of
winning the game. That being said, it's still a lot of pawns and the rooks can
coordinate well against the king even now.} 47. b4 Qf7+ 48. Kg2 e4 49. Re5 $1
{After the mistakes, Svidler plays well again to not allow winning chances.}
Qf3+ 50. Kh2 Qc3 51. Rdd5 e3 52. Re8 Kg7 53. Kh3 Qe1 54. Rde5 Qxb4 55. Rg5+ Kf7

62. Re3 a5 63. h5 (63. Rexe7+ Qxe7 64. Rxe7+ Kxe7 65. h5 Kf6 $19 {Black stops
the pawns and queens on the queenside.}) 63... Kd8 (63... a4 64. h6 {is winning
as Black now can't stop Rxe7.}) 64. Rg8+ Kd7 65. Rg7 Kd8 66. Rg8+ { An
interesting draw that surely leaves Svidler with a sour taste.} 1/2-1/2
