can be regarded as fairly equal, even though it is easrier to find moves for
White (plan d3-d4). Grandelius played 13...Tfe8 against Hillarp 2009. But now
he deviates.} Kh7 {It is certainly not clear that this move is an improvement.
Jonny has a keen eye for tactics and spots the oppurtunity to seize a small
initiative.} 14. d4 $1 Rfe8 (14... exd4 15. cxd4 Nxd4 16. Nxd4 Bxd4 17. Qd3 {
Threatening e4-e5+.} Be5 18. f4 {and White is very much better.}) 15. Be3 Kg8 (

will emerge with a superior coordination and a helthy pawn (d5) up.}) 16. Rad1
exd4 (16... b5 {finally threating the pawn was the alternative.}) 17. cxd4 Nxe4

at gaining an important tempi.} Rb8 (22... Rb7 23. d5 Nb8 24. Bxa7 Ra4 25. Qd3

So far Hector has played a perfect game and I can imagine that in his mind
there was a sence of harmony.} 26. d5 ({Perhaps White could improve te
position even a little bit further before playing d5.} 26. Nb3 {it is not easy
to see how black can prevent d4-d5 as} d5 27. Rec1 {is winning the piece.})
26... Rxd5 27. Bxb6 Bxb6 28. Nb3 Rf5 29. Re2 Ne5 30. Qa8+ $6 ({Hector is
clearly very good at endgames, and many topplayers would probably not give
many seconds of thought to} 30. Qxd7 {simply exhanging the Queen and then
slowly grind Black down.} Nxd7 31. a4 $1 {heading for a ending with an clear
exchange up due to the weak c7-d6-pawns.} g6 32. a5 Bxa5 33. Nxa5 Rxa5 34. Rxc7

{Now, on the other hand the picture is not so clear.} Ng6 ({Putting up
resistance with a advanced frontier by playing} 31... d5 32. Qc2 g6 {was
better. Black has interesting possibilities as Q-d6-g3 (when circumstances
allow it), and d4-d3 which gives White some problems.}) 32. Rf3 Re5 33. Qc2 Kg8
34. Rxe5 Nxe5 35. Rc3 {[#] If we compare this position to the one with Queens
exhanged one can see that this one demands an exceptional level of technique
for White.} d5 36. Qe2 Qf5 37. Nd2 $1 ({I still like the idea of playing} 37.

with} d4 38. Rc1 d3 39. Qd2) 37... d4 {Jonny finds a clever way to activate
the rook.} 38. Ra3 d3 39. Qe1 $6 ({Again Jonny disregards the exchange of
Queens. This time it was not as obvious as last time:} 39. Ra8+ Kh7 40. Qe4

Centralization.} 48. Ra4 Qc6 49. Qd1 Qc5 50. Qe1 Qc2 (50... Ba5 $1) 51. Re4 $2

Qa7+ Ba5 63. Qd4+ Ka3 64. Qd6+ Bb4 {This game might indicate that Grandelius
will win this year. Despite weak play in the initial phase of the middlegame
and inadequate creativity in the defence he ended up winning by oppotunistic
play in a losing position. And Nils will probably not end up in many more
losing positions in the tournament. Jonny on the other hand might consider to
forget about the audience once and a while. His preformance up to move 29 was
absolutely world class. It is allowed to finnishing of games boringly...} 0-1
