1. e4  e5  2. f4 $5 {0 When was the last time someone played the King's Gambit
against Wesley So?! Well, the databases reveal that this was the first time!
Adhiban has seriously made some very interesting choices at this event. Rather
than going deep into some line, he has just changed the battlefield in order to
make it more even.} exf4  3. Bc4  (3. Nf3 {is by far the most popular move in
the position.}) 3... d5 {405 Played after seven minutes of thought. Wesley
would have definitely prepared something against the King's Gambit but to
remember all the analysis on the spot is not an easy task.} (3... Qh4+ 4. Kf1
{The tempo that you will gain with Nf3 is worth losing your castling rights!})
4. Bxd5  Nf6  5. Nc3  Nxd5  6. Nxd5  Bd6  (6... g5 {is another possible move,
but Wesley likes to go for simple developing moves rather than clinging on to
pawns with moves like g5.}) 7. Nf3  O-O  8. d4 {0 Adhiban was still blitzing
his moves.} Re8 {905 15 minutes of thought! The opening is already a success
for the Indian player.} 9. e5  c6  (9... f6 10. Bxf4 $14) 10. Nxf4 {54 White
has not only recovered his pawn, but is a pawn up and has a clearly preferable
position. Getting such a position against Wesley after 10 moves in any major
well-known opening line might be almost impossible.} f6  11. Nd3 {712 The first
move where Adhiban had to think. 12 minutes for 11.Nd3.} (11. O-O $5 fxe5 12.

 Bc7  16. O-O  Qa6 {14 White is a pawn up, but Black's bishop pair and the
pretty weak e5 pawn gives Black decent compensation.} (16... Bxd3 17. Qxd3 Bxe5

19. Nf4 $18) 18. Bd4 {1568 Adhiban played after 26 minutes, but this move lets
Black equalize with ease.} (18. b3 $5 Bxd3 19. Rxd3 Nxe5 20. Nxe5 Bxe5 21. c4
