1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 {The Scotch! Kasparov tried to revive
this in the GM Blitz Challenge last week, perhaps Shirov was paying attention.}
Nf6 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. Qe2 (6. e5 Qe7 7. Qe2 Nd5 {has been the main line for a
long time, but the alternative played in the game might be picking up a bit of
steam as White has found nothing in the main line.}) 6... Bb4+ {One of many
moves that Black has tried recently. The argument is that the pawn on c3
hinders White's development.} 7. c3 Be7 8. e5 Nd5 9. Qg4 {the novelty of the
game, you could say, as there are no relevant games after this in strong GM
practice.} Kf8 (9... g6 {has it's own drawbacks, like weakening the darksquares
and allowing 10.Bh6.}) 10. Qe4 {The position is already very crazy. White has
moved his queen a bunch of times in the opening, Black has doubled pawns and
cannot castle... It's not something easy to explain to beginners!} d6 {A pawn
sacrifice which was, more or less, forced.} 11. c4 Nb6 12. Qxc6 Rb8 13. Nc3 Bb7
14. Qb5 {White has won a pawn, but now Black has incredible compensation. His
pieces are all active and there are still threats against the roaming queen.}
Nd7 $1 15. exd6 Bxd6 (15... cxd6 {was another idea, with the transfer of the
bishop to f6 instead of d6.}) 16. Qg5 f6 {Of course, being down a pawn, Sevian
has no interest in a queen trade.} 17. Qh5 Qe7+ 18. Be2 $5 {Giving back the
pawn, but allowing White his own counterplay opportunity.} Bxg2 {Black has no
choice but to accept the sacrifice, otherwise Shirov would castle and start
consolidating.} 19. Rg1 Be4 20. c5 $5 {This move adds a ton of excitement to
the game!} (20. Rxg7 Kxg7 21. Bh6+ Kg8 22. c5 {would, surprisingly, transpose
into the game.}) 20... Nxc5 21. Rxg7 Kxg7 22. Bh6+ Kg8 23. O-O-O Bg6 24. Bc4+
{This was the point long ago of c5. The bishop targets the king in the opened
a2-g8 diagonal and defending it is rather awkward, but Black still has
sufficient defense.} Ne6 25. Qh3 (25. Qd5 Kf7 26. Re1 Be5 27. Rxe5 fxe5 28.
Qxe5 {would be an entirely different mess.}) 25... Kf7 26. Nd5 { Shirov must
have seen this far, noticing that there are some very serious threats against
Black's position. However, Sevian has a beuatiful counter response.} Rxb2 $3
(26... Qd7 27. Nxc7 $1 {is far from clear, but very scary for Black.}) 27. Kxb2
(27. Nxe7 Rc2+ 28. Kb1 Rc3+ 29. Nxg6 Rb8+ $1 {An important intermediate so that
the rook is not hanging on h8 at the end of the variation.} 30. Ka1 Rxh3 {and
Black is up a ton of material.} 31. Bxe6+ Kxg6 { doesn't allow White to get his
rook back as Be5 mate is in the air.}) 27... Rb8+ 28. Bb3 Be5+ {With White's
king suddenly weak, it is Black's turn to be in the offensive.} 29. Nc3 c5 $6
(29... Ke8 $1 {Was a great time to consolidate the king, which reminds of
Kasparov's approach to attacks time and time again: king safety before going
for the kill.}) 30. f4 c4 31. fxe5 cxb3 32. a4 Nc5 33. exf6 $1 {Shirov has
certainly managed to muddle the waters. The position is, again, far from
clear.} Qc7 $1 34. Rd4 Rd8 35. Rxd8 Qxd8 36. Qe3 Qd6 {Even with this limited
material on the board, Both sides have to be incredible careful as their kings
are weak. It was probably a good time to bail out in this position:} 37. Nb5 $2
{The losing mistake, and this time Sevian does not forgive.} (37. Qe7+ Qxe7 38.
fxe7 Kxe7 39. Be3 {should be approximately a draw.}) 37... Nd3+ 38. Kb1 Ne5+
39. Kb2 Nd3+ {Always repeat.} 40. Kb1 Nf2+ $1 41. Kc1 (41. Kb2 Nd1+ 42. Kxb3
Qd5+ {and the queen falls next move.}) 41... Qd1+ 42. Kb2 Nd3+ 43. Ka3 Qa1+ 44.
Kxb3 Qb2+ 45. Kc4 Qb4+ 46. Kd5 Be4+ {The only winning move, and a pretty one at
that! White gets mated on c5 next move. A fantastic game!} 0-1
