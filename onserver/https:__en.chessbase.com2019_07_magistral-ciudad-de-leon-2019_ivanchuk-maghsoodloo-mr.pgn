alternatives. The game has more or less transposed to the famous English

opposite sides of the board: an ideal situation for a must-win game.} (10. h4

up the center for the light-square bishop or, as in the game, shutting down
the activity of both bishops (c6 but also d4). After the game Maghsoodloo
mentioned that his team-mate iranian GM Tabatabei had analysed this position
and found it playable.} 17. e5 a5 18. f4 ({The computer claims an advantage
for White with} 18. Nf4 $5 {followed by the pawn sacrifice 19.g6 and then 20.

towards the e4 (or a4) squares.} ({A previous game between Hracek,Z (2633) and

my opinion anything but a draw can happen here!}) 19. Qe3 Ne4 20. Bh3 $5 {
Threatening ideas with maybe 21.f5 or even 21.g6!? followed by 22.h5.} (20. Ng3

at the same time opening the c-file for an attack on c2.} 21. Bg2 $1 {Ivanchuk
wants to exchange the strong knight on e4 but he does lose a tempi. The
computer however agrees with his decision!} Qc7 $1 22. Bxe4 dxe4 23. Ng3 {
It seems that White is doing well by attacking the e4 pawn and f5-h5 are on
the line. However, Black also can attack with a4-b3 and also the light-squared
bishop could now become very strong in some situations. At this point there
was a lot of excitement in the playing hall as anything could happen.} (23.

defensive approach in these types of position (cxb3 followed by a3 closing the
queenside) will not work here.} ({The key move was} 26. Bc3 $1 {and now} bxa2+

can now counterattack on the kingside}) 26... axb3 27. a3 Bc6 $1 28. Rhd2 ({
The idea behind 27...Bc6 can be seen in the line} 28. h5 Bxe4+ $1 29. Qxe4 Ra4
$1 {Threatening all sorts of tactics based on White's back-rank weakness and
the pawn on b3. The main threat is 30...Rxd4 winning.}) {Black increases the
pressure on files and diagonals. Although the computer says that White is fine,
in practice it's easy to overstep.} 28... Ra4 29. Nc3 ({Returning the pawn with

to now had played a very decent game, loses his cool and opens up the position
at a bad moment.} (30. h5 Qb7 31. Rd3 {and Black has obvious compensation for
the pawn but there's no clear way to break open White's castled king.}) 30...

suspect Ivanchuk had calculated when he played 30.f5 but as I always say to my
students "Long line, wrong line". It's not surprising that Black has the nice
"zwischenzug" 31...Be4+ that leaves White on the ropes.}) 32. Ka1 (32. Nxe4
Rc1+ 33. Rxc1 Qxc1#) {And White is busted. Ivanchuk played his last card.}

commentary "there is no need to capture the bishop and Parham won't". He was
right!}) 34. Bf6 Bxa3 $1 35. Rd8+ (35. bxa3 Qxa3+ 36. Na2 Qxa2+) 35... Bf8+ {
Blacking a check and delivering mate at the same time is a very nice way to
end the tournament!} 0-1
