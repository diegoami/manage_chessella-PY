{From the point of view of the standings this is an extremely important game.}
1. c4 {Topalov is going for different moves. Against Svidler he played 1.e4 and
now against Caruana 1.c4.} c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 e6 6. g3
{The g3 line in this variation can lead to highly interesting games but many
times they end in long theoretical draws.} Qb6 7. Ndb5 Ne5 8. Bf4 Nfg4 9. e3
(9. Qa4 {The game Shankland vs Peter Leko comes to mind.}) 9... a6 10. Qa4 { We
still have nine games that are played in this variation.} Ra7 {[%cal Ga8a7]
Although this is unusual, this is still not a novelty. It has been played
before by Alexander Grischuk and Amin Tabatabaei.} (10... Rb8 {is one of the
main moves.} 11. Be2 axb5 12. Nxb5 g5 13. Bxg5 {Leads to a very complicated
position.}) 11. h3 $1 {The only move in the position.} (11. Nxa7 $2 Qxb2 12.

change the nature of the position.} 14. Bxd3 Qxh1+ 15. Bf1 $13) 14. Bxe5 (14.
Qxe5 {was also possible.}) 14... Qc6 15. Bd4 Ra8 16. a3 $5 {A calm move, just
improving the position. At some point when White castles the pawn on a3 will in
general be useful controlling the b4 square and shutting out the a8 rook.} Be7
17. Qh5 $1 {White understands that keeping the queens on the board improves his
position. Now it is difficult for Black to co-ordinate his pieces. } (17. Bxg7

draw.} Bxd6 (21... Qxd6 22. Bxg7+ Kxg7 23. Rxd6 Bxd6 24. Qg5+ $18) 22. Bxg7+

improvements and variations on every move of this line.}) 32... Rc4 33. Ka2 Rh2

Caruana exchange the bishops and win it in a simple fashion?} (36... Bxf4 $1

threats of Rxc5 and queening the b-pawn.} g5 (39... Kf8 $17 {was the best, but
under time pressure it wasn't easy for Fabiano to find this move.}) 40. Bxg5

already quite dangerous for Black. The two bishops combined with queenside
majority looks really threatening.} 1/2-1/2
