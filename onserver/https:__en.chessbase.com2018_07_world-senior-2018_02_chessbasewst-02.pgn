After this White retains slight pressure to the end, when there was no point
in declining my opponent's draw offer. I had just been lamenting about how
much difficulty I was having beating much weaker players. My opponent played
very well, with the exception of one slip, and with jet lag acting up I wasn't
sharp enough to beat him.} Rxa6 28. Ra1 Rd7 29. Rdb1 Rda7 30. Qc3 Qd8 31. Rb5
