{844 The idea is to not only threaten to weaken Black's kingside, but take
advantage that his pieces are so awkwardly placed.} h6  8. h5  Ng8 {1439 The
idea of this strange looking retreat is to play Nf6 Be7 and castle, while
possibly attacking the h5 pawn.} 9. d5  Nce7  10. c4  b5  11. Bc2  f5 $6 {213
This seems far too optimistic. The point is to weaken White's hold on f5 and be
able to play Nf5, Nf6 and Be7, but this presume White has nothing better to do
that sit back and watch Black do what he likes.} 12. Nh4 {1204 Shirov isn't
exactly known for 'sitting back' and doing nothing.} f4  13. g3  fxg3  14. f4 
Nf6  15. fxe5  Bg4  16. Qd3  Nxh5 $6 { 41 O Ye of Little Faith.} 17. e6  Ng6 $2
{402 It is hard to know what to make of this. Desperation?} ({It's true that
the more normal} 17... c6 18. Qd4 c5 19. Qd3 {seems to only promise trouble,
but still, it has to be more resistant than chucking a piece out the window.})
18. Nxg6  Qf6  19. Qf1  Bf3  20. Rg1  Be7  21. Nxh8 {543 I'll take that rook,
thank you very much.} Qd4  22. Rg2  1-0
