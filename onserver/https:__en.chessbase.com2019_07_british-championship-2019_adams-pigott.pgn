Bd6 $2 {[#] Perhaps I could be too critical of Pigott here, as I know how
difficult it can be to play these guys on the top boards when all the
attention is on you, but this is a real howler. White can now carry out a
combination that leaves him with a clear advantage.} (10... Nf6 {was much more
solid.}) 11. Nc6 $1 Qc7 12. Qxd6 Qxd6 13. Bxd6 bxc6 14. O-O-O {[#] as I said
at the time on the commentary, White enjoys the better pawn structure, the two
bishops and the Black king is stuck in the center, but apart from that...  
The other problem for Black is that moving the knight to d5 to try and place
that piece as a blocker doesn't really work, as White can simply move his
bishop from c4 and kick the knight away by playing c4, so we can already say
that the opening is a disaster for Black.  That doesn't seem to be much more I
can say about this game, so I leave you with the rest of the moves without
commentary.} Bb7 15. Rhe1 Rd8 16. Re3 Nf6 17. Rb3 Bc8 18. f3 Nd5 19. Bc5 h5 20.
