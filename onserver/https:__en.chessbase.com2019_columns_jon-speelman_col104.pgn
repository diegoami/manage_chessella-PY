-336,-247,-267,-280] This game is from the Zuercher Team Championship between
Schachgesellschaft Zuerich - Pfaeffikon ZH. After a rather well played game
against a stronger opponent, I suddenly collapsed in a totally won position.
No surprise that I didn't sleep well that night.} 1. d4 e6 {As a French and
Dutch Defence player I always choose this transposition of moves to avoid the
Staunton-Gambit after 1.d4 f5 2.e4.} 2. c4 (2. Nf3 f5 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 g6 5.

Williams I have changed my repertoire to the so called "Dutch Christmas Tree"
which is somewhat more active than the Classical Dutch with 5...Be7.} 6. Bg2
Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 Ne4 9. Qc2 Nxc3 10. bxc3 e5 11. e4 {[#] I was still in
my opening preparation and very surprised about my oppenent who has made his
moves so far very slowly and nevertheless found the best moves. I knew the
interesting continuation 11...f4!? but feared that White could play the
critical variation won by GM D. Jakovenko vs GM S. Willaims at Novi Sad in
2016. Therefore, I choose another logical move in this kind of position.} Nc6 (

alternatives are 12.dxe5 and 12.exf5.} Qe8 13. d5 $6 {A positional error
giving Black the advantage.} Nd8 {Instantly played and neglecting the perhaps
even stronger 13...Na5.} ({JS was instant thought but White can cause too much
trouble before Black stabilises matters.} 13... Nb8 14. exf5 Bxf5 (14... gxf5

control of the e4 square White loks OK or at least OK-ish}) 14... Qxd8 15. c5 {
?! This came as a real surprise to me. JS I thought he had to play this before
Black could prevent it but I guess that without a knight to go to c5 I may be
wrong.} b6 {Forcing White to put his cards on the table. Not for a second had
I considered the (in my opinion) positionally unsound ...dxc5.} 16. c6 {Instead of
opening the c-file for Black's rook, White is closing the position. But now,
Black has free hands on the kingside.} f4 {Bringing White into an
uncomfortable situation.} 17. a4 a5 {Giving White no chance for the break
a4-a5.} 18. Nd2 Bh6 {?! Having plenty of time left on my clock - not an
everyday occurence in my games - I played too fast and missed the much
stronger 18...g5 or 18...Qf6.} 19. Qd1 Qg5 20. Nf3 (20. Ra2 {JS was better
when he dfends f2 ergonomically.}) 20... Qf6 {Not bad but had I taken more
time I would have found the stronger 20...Qh5.} 21. Nd2 {? It's often the same
thing. If stronger players get under pressure against underdogs, they are not
immune against errors. And 21.Nd2 should just lose the game.} fxg3 22. f3 (22.
fxg3 Qf2+ 23. Kh1 Qxd2 {-+ wins a piece}) 22... gxh2+ 23. Kh1 {Forced in view
of 23.Kxh2 Qf4+ followed by ...Qxd2.} Bf4 24. Nf1 Qg5 25. Ra2 h5 {Other moves
win too.} 26. Nxh2 Bxh2 {Not the best solution but sufficient to win. After 26.
..Qh4 White would be helpless.} ({JS Absolutely. It was a real shame to cash
in such a massive bishop so early. Black just needs to take aim and fire while
avoiding any trouble, and with the bishop on f4 you can always take the knight
whenever you want. I'd like to complete my development and either batter White
with g5-4 or get doubled on the f-file first and take aim at f3 later.} 26...

exchange for nothing}) 27. Kxh2 Rf4 28. Qd2 Qh4+ {I had already written down
28...Rh4+ on my notation sheet and changed my mind at the last moment.} 29. Kg1
Qg3 {Black has still a won position.} 30. Qf2 {[#]} Rxf3 {This is a good move
but it puts a lot of strain on Black who now has to be very careful due to the
coming invasion along the f-file.} ({Instead} 30... Qxf2+ 31. Kxf2 Ba6 {
really ought to win without risk. Black will double on the f-file to tie White
down, put his king on h6 say and then arrange a breakthrough, of some sort
perhaps involving g4 or Rxf3+ Not only is White weak on the kingside but his
queenside is a disaster area too. In particular the a4 pawn and once he's tied
down it shouldn't be possible both to defend it and the kingside. The thing is
that a stronger player facing a weaker one might well settle for this,
presuming that "he'd win in the end". But a weaker or rather lower rated one
facing a stronger tends to want to win by force to get it over. This may
involve playing a number of good perhaps even only moves rather than a string
of good ones (in the longer but much safer version). And things can easily go
wrong.} 32. Ke3 Raf8 33. Rh1 Kg7 34. Rc2 Bc4 {There's no reason at all to

has totally changed in favour of White.} Qxd5 {? A further worse mistake in a
very bad position. After the next move Black is going to be checkmated or to
lose the queen.} 37. Rf7 {Black resigned JS: A horrible loss for Kurt. He
outprepared his opponent in the opening and then outplayed him too to reach a
clearly winning position but then first cashed in too early with Bxf2 and then
chose to win a second pawn with Rxf3 when reamining just one pawn up with the
queens off would have been a much simpler and safer way to play and
definitely ought to win in the end.} 1-0

478,1014,1006,1028,975,1107,862] A typical game on club level bases with
errors on both sides and a lucky end for White. My analysis at home revealed
that I had not at all understood the best strategy in the symmetrical position
of the Tarrasch Defence in the Queen's Gambit declined.} 1. Nf3 {Two things
should be mentioned beforehand: I am a slow player often using far too much
time even for ordinary moves. This is due to the fact of playing much too few
tournament games. Furthermore, I prefer to play with the black pieces, either
the French defence or the Dutch defence. At the time of playing this game in
the Swiss Team Championship 1st Division 2005, I had still no suitable opening
repertoire with the white pieces. For this reason I often started my games
with 1.Nf3 in the hope of a quiet battle and not trying to get an advantage in
the opening.} c5 2. c4 {Of course not 2.e4 leading to the complex Sicilian
Defence I have never studied.} e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3 {? I knew the theory about
the Tarrasch Defence but wanted to play something else and invested five
minutes for this dubious move. Why on Earth did I not fear the unpleasant reply
4...d4?} (4. cxd5 exd5 5. d4 Nc6 6. g3 {and so on}) 4... Nc6 5. d4 Nf6 6. a3 {

surely not best (my feeling) but throwing me out of book.} 7. Bd3 {After 9 min
and rejecting the best continuation 7.cxd5 and all variations leading to
hanging pawns for black.} ({Yes JS:} 7. cxd5 {was very unpleasant because
White can generate immediate tactics:} Nxd5 (7... exd5 $2 8. Bb5 Bb7 9. Qa4 Qc7

This is similar to lines of the Queen's Gambit Accepted but White has played
Bf1-d3xc4 in two moves and Black hasn't spent a tempo on a6}) 8. b3 {?! Not
much of an invention and only played in the hope that Black would give me the
opportunity to get the hanging pawns c4/d4. Frankly spoken, I felt unsure
about what to do. Better, looks 8.0-0 or first cxd5 and then 0-0.} Be7 9. O-O
O-O 10. Bb2 a6 11. Rc1 Rc8 12. dxc5 {The thinking time of 14 minutes for this
move shows my indecisiveness in this type of position. I remember that I had also
calculated 12.Qe2 and 12.cxd5. After the text move I expected 12...dxc4 and my
intention was to exchange queens. JS: Without any exchanges yet whatseover
this is a very complicated position and since decisions taken now will hugely
impact on the rest of the game, it was perfectly reasonable for Kurt to think
a long time.} bxc5 {[#]} 13. Qc2 {My intuition went for 13.cxd5 Nxd5 but I

overlooking the following reply.} Nd7 {! A strong and (for White) unpleasant
retreat preparing...f7-f5.} 19. Ng3 {I was shocked to see 18...Nd7 and needed
19 minutes for my reply. Being not at all happy about a passive defence with
19. f3 f5 20.Nf2, I decided to disturb the peace with 19.Ng3 planning to
sacrifice the knight after 19...f5 20.Nxf5.} Nc5 {My very much surprised
opponent found the best move after 12 minutes.} (19... f5 20. Nxf5 gxf5 21.

Black might still be better, his kingside remains very open.}) 20. b4 {In view

clearly better.} f5 {?! For once my oppenent played too fast.} 22. f4 {[#] !?

Black.} exf4 {?! 12 minutes for this second-class move} (22... Bf6 {was my
expectation} 23. fxe5 Bxe5 {=+ still favouring Black but White is alive}) (

Although Black is a pawn down, all of his pieces are working and he obviously
has a very decent game but I was surprised that Houdini gives this as nearly 1.
5 pawns up for Black}) 23. Bxf4 {?! Played too fast; only after executing this
move I realized that 23.Ne2 would have been a stronger alternative.} Bf6 24.
Bh6 {13 min; not best but I felt some indecision on the part of my opponent
and decided to fight for all or nothing in the style of Mikhail Tal.} Re8 25.
Nxf5 {This piece sacrifice is objectively not justified. White gets only two
pawns, but after ... JS The sacrifice is the only move that makes any sense of
White's position and otherwise he will merely be suffering with excellent
losing chances so I think that even if engines (and strong players after
thinking sufficiently) scoff at it, it should definitely be played preferably
quickly before White talks himself out of it.} Be4 {? An obvious mistake since
Black has simply overlooked my reply.} ({After} 25... gxf5 26. Qxf5 Rc6 27. Rd3
Kh8 {White has no attacking chances and too little compensation for the piece.})
26. Qg3 {Pinning the g6-pawn thus not loosing the f5-knight.} Qd7 {? Black,
surprised by the sudden turnaround of the situation, loses his head an makes
a further, but this time decisive error. After 26...Bxf5 or 26...Be5 the
fight will go on, with better chances for White.} 27. Nd6 {Winning material
and the game.} Bc2 {In the post mortem analysis after the game my opponent
confessed that he only now realized that} (27... Be5 {does not help on account
of} 28. Nxe8 {and if} Bxg3 {so} 29. Nf6+ Kh8 30. Nxd7 {when White has an
overwhelming advantage}) 28. Nxe8 {There are several other winning moves
available. But being short of time I chose the first line I had evaluated as
won for me. JS Quite right. You only need to win once.} Rxe8 29. Rde1 Rxe1 30.
Qxe1 Qe7 31. Qf2 {Attacking Bc2 and Bf6} Kf7 {? Makes things very easy for
White.} ({But} 31... Bf5 {does not help; my intention was to continue with} 32.

Bxh6 34. Qg2 Be3+ 35. Kh1 g5 36. f6 {+-}) 32. Qxc2 {Black looked rather
confused that this was possible. Before recovering from this shock, he made
some useless moves and then resigned.} Qe5 33. Qf2 g5 34. Re1 {[#] A fierce
battle in which both players initially found it hard to get to grips with an
extremely complicated early middlegame. Kurt was outplayed for a while but
seized his moment to sacrifice and even though Nxf5 was definitely unsound in
a higher sense, in practice fortune favoured the brave.} 1-0
