Qf7 15. b3 {[%cal Gg2g4] By this point I was already quite happy with my
position. The thing is that I have chances to improve my position with the move
g4. While Black on the other hand has no real ways to attack my king. A move
like ...a5 is met with a4 and the queenside attack is going nowhere. These are
the kinds of positions that one would like to avoid, where your opponent has
all the chances to improve the position and you do not have any.} Bd6 16. Rhf1
Kh8 17. Bc1 (17. g4 {was already a good move, following it up with ideas like
h4 and h5.}) 17... b6 18. h4 Qh5 19. Qe1 $6 {I am not sure why I made this
move? The h4 pawn is really not so important. If Black takes it, he opens the
line against his king. I should have just improved the position of the rook. I
think from here onwards I started to drift into a bad position.} ( 19. Rde1 $14
{The problem with Rg1 and g4 still exists for Black.}) 19... Bd7 $1 {This was a
really strong idea. Black proceeds with Bc6, Re8 and already starts to threaten
the move e4.} 20. Bb2 Rae8 21. Be2 Bc6 22. c4 h6 23. g3 Qg6 24. f4 { This was a
very doubled edged decision. I was not very happy that Black could himself play
f4 at some point and hence decided to make this move myself.} Re7 $6 (24...
exf4 $1 25. gxf4 {This opens the g-file, but concretely, and was a powerful
move.} Qg2 $1 {An important move.} 26. Rf2 (26. Rg1 Rxe2 $1 (26... Qxe2 $2 27.

defended, all of White's pawns are weak and Black is clearly better. }) 27...

it is very unpleasant. White has weaknesses and Black is very solid.}) 25. fxe5

with this move in my calculations, but White has the strong move now} (26...
Bd6 27. Bxd6 cxd6 28. Bh5 $1 $14 {Already this will lead to a very pleasant
endgame for White. The pawn on d6 is weak. I will have my bishop on g6 and with
the pawn on h5, I will always have threats against his king.}) 27. Rg1 $1
{which I missed.} Bxe1 28. Rxg6 Rxe2 29. Bxf8 $18 { And now both g7 and c6 are
hanging.}) 26... Rxe5 {After this the game was around even.} 27. Qf2 Rfe8 28.

doesn't agree with me!} bxc5 37. Rd5 Qxc3+ 38. Kxc3 f4 (38... f4 39. gxf4 Rxf4
40. h5 {At this point White will pick up the c5 pawn and also perhaps the one
on a7. Black on the other hand will try and create a passer with g6. It will be
a complete mess. I think he was leading the tournament and was happy with the
draw, and I was also quite fine with the result.}) 1/2-1/2
