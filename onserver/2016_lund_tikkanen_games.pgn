{There were many upsets in the tournament and Tikkanen could have made the
list just a little bit longer if Black wouldn't have played:} 23... Qd8 ({But} 
23... Nd4 $1 24. Bxc7 (24. Qd3 Qxc2+ 25. Qxc2 Nxc2) 24... Ne2+ 25. Kb1 Nxg3 26.
Rh3 Ne4 {If you thought the line ends here, think for just 30 sec more!} 27.
Re3 (27. Bd6 Nf2) 27... Nf2 (27... Rxc7 {would give White hopes for survival
in the rook endgame} 28. Rxe4 {- the rook is taboo.}) 28. Rd2 Ng4 29. Rg3 Nxh6
{The game is not won yet but I doubt Black would get additional headaches when
finishing it off.}) 24. f5 {This break is not a deadly blow and the game could
have most probably been saved in the ensuing rook endgame but that is a
completely different story. For now I was just testing your calculation skills:

{The Swedish GM had another nail-biting moment when Black missed his chance:} 
27... Qd4 ({This is ineffective but} 27... Rf6 $1 {is a better way to cover
the long diagonal:} 28. Bd5 {and now} Nd3 {is possible and lethal since White
doesn't have the c3-check anymore. With an exchange up, Black shouldn't have a
lot of trouble in converting the advantage.}) 28. Rd2 Nd3 29. Qe2 Nf2+ 30. Kh2
