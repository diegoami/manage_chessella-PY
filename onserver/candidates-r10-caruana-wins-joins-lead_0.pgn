bxc3 Re8 9. f3 {We saw this same opening in the game between Peter Svidler and
Sergey Karjakin in the eighth round of the tournament. In that encounter,
Sergey had played e3. Vishy goes for the more normal approach by taking the
pawn on f3.} exf3 10. Nxf3 d5 11. d4 $5 {This move came into popularity when
Garry Kasparov used it to beat Vassily Ivanchuk in 1988. It was revelation at
that moment in time, and even now the line has not been thoroughy investigated,
as Caruana shows in this game.} (11. cxd5 Qxd5 $13 {How can Black play such a
position where his opponent has a bishop pair and also the huge central mass of
pawns? The answer is that the central pawns cannot really advance easily and
Black has activity. Chess cannot be so generic that in an open position the
bishop pair have to be better!}) 11... dxc4 ({The famous game between Kasparov
and Ivanchuk continued in this manner.} 11... Ne4 12. Qc2 dxc4 13. Rb1 f5 14.

(24) Kasparov,G (2760)-Ivanchuk,V (2625) Moscow 1988}) 12. Qc2 $146 { The
novelty. Afterwards Caruana said that he had prepared this novelty just the
previous night with Rustam Kasimdzhanov. He hadn't spent much time on it but
had realized that this was interesting and well worth giving a try.} ({ The
only move that had been played before was Bg5. What would have convinced
Caruana that Anand would choose this line? First of all Anand had played it
against Aronian in the Sinquefield Cup 2015, and then Vishy's second Gajewski
had also tried it against Tomashevsky in the World Blitz. This is a good enough
proof that Anand had worked out the opening with his second.} 12. Bg5 h6 13.

Rae1 Rab8 17. Qxc4 b5 $11 {1/2-1/2 (31) Aronian,L (2765)-Anand,V (2816) Saint
Louis 2015}) 15. Nd2 Bd7 16. Nxc4 Qe7 17. Qf3 $16 {1-0 (66) Tomashevsky, E
(2758)-Gajewski,G (2654) Berlin 2015}) 12... h6 {Anand replies in the most
human way as possible. The move is absolutely correct and stops ideas like Bg5
and Ng5.} (12... Rb8 13. Ng5 h6 14. Rxf6 hxg5 15. Rf2 $16 {with e4 coming up is
completely better for White.}) (12... Ne4 13. Ne5 $1 Nxe5 14. Qxe4 Ng4 15. Qf4
$14) 13. Bf4 {Caruana played these moves pretty quickly while Anand was
thinking quite a bit. This is just a normal developing move with the idea of
bringing the rook to the centre.} Ne4 {This knight move is natural, but it
forces Black to be accurate.} (13... Rb8 14. Rae1 b5 15. e4 {Looks quite scary
to face over the board.}) (13... Nd5 {According to Caruana the computer prefers
this move but after} 14. e4 Nxf4 15. gxf4 {it looks completely better for White
(according to Fabiano). The computer doesn't agree with this evaluation but
when a player like Fabiano says that this looks horrible for Black, we must
definitely pay attention to that.} Bg4 16. Rae1 {Maybe future games on this
line will prove whether Black really has a huge advantage or not. }) 14. Rad1
Bf5 {The reason this move is dangerous is because it forces Black to be
extremely accurate. When your opponent has checked the lines at home and you
haven't, this is not a good position to be in. Now Black has threats like Nxg3,
but White's next move simply ignores it!} (14... Qe7 {was the other approach
here and this looked much safer.}) 15. Ne5 $1 Nd6 (15... Nxg3 { This is once
again the computer's suggestion.} 16. e4 Nxf1 (16... Nxe4 17. Bxe4 Bxe4 18.
Qxe4 f6 19. Nxc6 $16) 17. exf5 Nxh2 18. Bxh2 {[%csl Gg2,Gh2] The computer
assesses this position as even, but Caruana felt that this should be definitely
better for White, especially with those two bishops aiming at the queenside. It
is not so easy to say who is right, but I really like White's position.}) 16.
e4 Bh7 {Black is a pawn up but these guys on e4 and d4 are just too strong.
Caruana's next move is also accurate.} 17. Qe2 $1 {Already it is very difficult
for Black to find a move. He cannot take on e5 and White's threat is to simply
take on c6, follow it up with e5 and then take the pawn on c4.} Ne7 {I do not
give it a dubious or a question mark because it was already very difficult to
suggest a move for Black.} 18. Bxh6 $1 {There are many other options in the
position, but if Bxh6 is good then we do not need to indulge in other lines.}
gxh6 19. Qh5 {There are all sorts of threats in the position. The f7 pawn is
hanging, and so is the one on h6. Ng4 is in the air and also Rf4 is threatened.
The defensive task for Black is not at all easy.} Nef5 { Black rushes to give
back a piece, but now it is just suffering without even having material gains.}
(19... Nd5 $5 20. Nxf7 $5 (20. exd5 Qg5 21. Qf3 { doesn't look so great, but is
maybe better than the game.}) 20... Nf6 21. Nxh6+ Kh8 22. Qh3 $40 {is also not
so easy for Black to play as Rf4-h4 is a huge threat.}) (19... Rf8 20. Qxh6

advantage, but what Caruana played was better.}) 20... Qg5 21. Qxg5+ hxg5 22.
f6 $16 {It goes without saying that White is better, but Anand's next move
takes him out of the fire into the frying pan!} Ne4 $6 ( 22... Rad8 {White's
advantage is beyond any doubt here, but Anand can definitely fight on.}) 23.

accuracy.} Rxf6 33. Rf1 $1 {The final move exchanging the rooks. Anand resigned
the game, seeing that further resistance would be futile. A great victory for
Caruana and a pretty disastrous game for Anand.} 1-0
