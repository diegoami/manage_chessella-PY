29... Nd3 {White's a pawn uo but Black is rather active and comes up with a
clever resource.} 30. Rc8+ Kg7 31. Rd8 $1 Rd1+ {Otherwise Black is just stuck}
32. Bf1 Nxf2 $6 (32... Nxb2 33. Rxd1 Nxd1 34. Bxa6 {It is hard to believe that
Black will survive with a pawn down and bishop vs. knight, but this was the
only chance.}) 33. Rd6 $1 {A beautiful idea. Black cannot move his knight
because he loses the rook, and can't move the rook because it loses the knight,
and can't trade because he can't stop the pawn!} Nh3+ 34. Kg2 Ra1 35. Bc4 {now
the knight is just stuck on h3.} Rc1 36. b3 Ng1 37. Rf6 1-0
