{(6:14) Anton Korobov is one of the most uncompromising players out there with
a distinguishing fighting spirit. Here, though, he succumbed to a tactical shot
he missed against Italian youngster Pier Luigi Basso.} Rd8 $2 {(2:45) in an
already much worse position, Korobov lets his young opponent winning the game
with a queen sacrifice!} (29... Rc7 30. Nxf7 Rxf7 31. Qxg5 Rf5 32. Qh4 Qc6+ 33.
Kh2 Rxc5 34. Qd8+ Kf7 35. Rxc5 Qxc5 36. Qd7+ Qe7 37. Qd5+ Ke8 {and black has to
sit tight and hope for the best.}) 30. Qxb7 $1 {(1:58) A blunder? No! a queen
sac!} Rb8  31. c6  Nf6  (31... Rxb7 32. cxb7 {and Rc8 cannot be prevented}) 32.
Nf3 $1 { (4:39) Basso shows great accuracy! Now everything is hanging while
Black's king is stuck in a somewhat mating net!} h6  33. Nxg5 {(03:57)
Flamboyant!} (33. Be5 {is a simpler version.}) 33... hxg5  34. Bxf6  Rxb7  35.
cxb7  Qe4+ {(4) The passed pawn is gone but the mate net is still there!} 36.
f3  Qxb7  37. Rd1 {(7) Rd8 cannot be prevented while it is impossible for
Black's king to run out of the box! Black has to give up his queen for the rook
but the ensuing endgame is elementary as White will be up a piece.} 1-0
