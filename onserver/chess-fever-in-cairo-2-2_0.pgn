{How would you continue with White? The Bulgarian GM went for the logical} 20.
exf6 {which brought him only half a point} ({In true Egyptian style} 20. Nc5 $1
{would have hit the jackpot!} fxg5 (20... Nxc5 $2 21. Bxf6 $1) 21. Nxe6 Qb6 22.
Nc7+ Kd8 23. Nxd5 Qb7 {Another positional sacrifice, which I simply admire a
lot! White can even go} 24. Qc6 $44 {where exchanging the queens is beneficial
only for White. Black's pieces are paralyzed, White's central pawns are very
dangerous and their black fellows too weak; I would put my money on 1-0. But I
must admit, not so easy to evaluate these unbalanced positions...}) 20... bxa4
21. f7+ Kxf7 22. Bxd8 Bb4 23. Ba5 Bxc3+ 24. Bxc3 {Marian drew the endgame and
finished on a shared 2nd place, with 7.5/9.} 1/2-1/2
