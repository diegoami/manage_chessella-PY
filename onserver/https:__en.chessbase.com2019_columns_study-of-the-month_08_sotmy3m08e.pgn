{Andrey Vysokosov, or Visokosov in the hhdbv spelling, has received 39 (out of
a maximum of 48) points for the studies he had entered from the years
2001-2003 until the closing date of 30 June 2004. Tourney director Mike Prcic
had selected Vazha Neidze (Georgia), Michael Roxlau (Germany) and Gheorghe
Telbis (Romania) as the judges for the endgame studies. The second place, Oleg
Pervakov, came close with his 38 points, but won 4 of the 7 WCCIs in the
endgame studies section so far. ----- Due to restrictions on official
information, I don't know if this or any other of the studies in this
selection was in the four out of six studies per composer used for the score 
(i.e. the highest judged ones). I only could confirm they were in the WCCI
entries. In the study here, White is to move and win, and the pointed play by
both sides is nice to watch, but would likely be difficult to solve. ----- 2nd

{Pavel Arestov, whose last name from Russian translates to "arrests" (no jokes

the first two places to Oleg Pervakov and Yuri Bazlov in the 2013-2015 period.

{Tata Steel was the Indian sponsor of the Wijk aan Zee tournament, which also
spawned a solving competition (usually led by Yochanan Afek) annually. The
composing competition was held for the 75th anniversary of the chess tourney.
-----The history of the top-class player tourney started as "Hoogovens
Beverwijk" in 1938, being held also during the upcoming war except in 1945.
1968 saw the tourney moving to Wijk aan Zee. The last year of the old
millennium saw a new sponsor, so from 2000 to 2010 it was "Corus Wijk aan Zee".
The Indian steel manufacturer took the sponsorship starting in 2011, and as of
this article being published remains the sponsor, with the 2020 tourney having
been planned already. In 2018, a tourney was held in Kolkata (former Kalkutta)
in India as well with the same sponsor. ----- Let us talk about the study now.
Yuri Bazlov (sometimes "Juri Baslow" in German) won the shared 1st/2nd prize
on the Tata Steel 75 AT (Anniversary Tourney) with this study that has a neat
stalemate avoidance at the end, but otherwise treads very much in classical
waters, having QS-QB (or QN-QB in players' abbreviations) as its pawnless
endgame where White wins by a fierce attack. This if however reached only
after an interesting introduction. So: White to move and win. (9.75 points,
6th WCCI 2013-2015)} 1. d7 Bc7 2. Rd6+ Ke1 ({White wants to promote his pawn,

it is a draw. In my childhood, I did the opposite thing in a blitz or rapid
tourney without increments: I declined a draw with the queen against the three
pieces in a pawnless endgame, and managed to win the pieces. Of course, this
was a children tourney, so I wouldn't advice for it today.}) 4... Bd8+ ({The
