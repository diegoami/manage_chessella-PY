Usually White plays 2. Nc3 before 3. f4, and this move by Black is supposed to
be the reason why. However, I had a secret variation planned.} 3. Nf3 dxe4 4.
Ng5 {White is playing a Budapest Gambit a tempo ahead. Is the extra tempo
spent on f2-f4 helpful or harmful?} Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 $6 {[#] The psychology of
this move is fascinating. In the post-mortem, someone asked David if he saw
the queen sac coming, and why he had walked into it? He said that, "I refuse to
be intimidated into playing a move that's not the best, just because my
opponent might get a few threats."} (5... e6 {is much safer. White continues}
6. Nc3 {and wins back his pawn.  JS Personally, I would play e6 instantly in a
blitz game and almost certainly after some thought at longer time limits too.
I love playing with two pieces for a queen and White's long-term advantages
make the gambit line very difficult and very possibly dispiriting to play as
Black. In contrast, after 5...e6 Black gets a perfectly pleasant position with
a nice safe king and good chances of playing for the advantage later. Indeed
the possibility of Black refusing it looks to me like the main downside of the
gambit.}) 6. Qxg4 $3 {A queen sac on move six! I had been playing this move
against the computer for two years. It is a fantastic anti-computer variation,
because computers can never understand White's compensation. White gets
ongoing pressure that typically lasts 30, 40, 50 moves -- beyond any
computer's threshold. But this was my first "serious" game against a human in
this line. I believe that I am the first person ever to play this queen sac in
an OTB game. However, I later discovered that it had been played several times
in the 1960s by a former Swedish correspondence champion, Arne Bryntse, and
therefore should be known as the Bryntse Gambit.} Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6
(8... Ke8 9. Bf7+ {would draw; clearly Black will not go for this if he
"refuses to be intimidated."}) (8... Kc7 9. Bxg4 Qe8 10. Ne6+ {is a variation
I have played a few times against the computer, but is mostly unexplored.}) 9.
Bxg4 e6 ({An important trap is} 9... e5 10. Nf7 Qh4+ ({JS} 10... Qe8 $1 11.
Nxe5+ (11. Nxh8 exf4) 11... Kc7 12. Nc3 Bd6 {is a pretty sensible way for
Black to play if he insists on taking the queen.}) 11. g3 Qxg4 $4 12. Nxe5+ {
This is how my first tournament game with the Bryntse Gambit went (Mackenzie -
Drayton Harrison, Reno 2006). My opponent grabbed the bishop to take it on
move 11, then he saw the fork. By the touch-move rule he had to play 11. ...
Qxg4, but he sat there with the bishop in his hand for five minutes before
finally completing the move. He resigned immediately after 12. Nxe5+.}) 10. Nc3
Na6 11. a3 $1 {GM Jesse Kraai, who was watching the game, was particularly
impressed by this slow move. You might expect White, after sacrificing his
queen, to try a blazing attack. But actually the strategy I had perfected
against the computer was a slow, "creeping" strategy, in which White's more-numerous pieces keep Black's position tied up in knots.  JS a3 seems
completely normal to me. The whole point is that White is playing chess and
claims that his two pieces and pawn or two are worth the queen so it makes
sesne to stop Nb4} Bd6 {After this move I had used only 2 minutes, while David
had used more than an hour. He was somewhat unlucky that Fritz 9 (my sparring
partner at the time) usually chose the same plan -- 9. ... e6, 10. ... Na6, 11.
... Bd6 -- so I was well prepared.} 12. O-O Nc7 (12... Bxf4 13. Nxe6 Bxh2+ 14.
Kxh2 Qh4+ 15. Bh3 g5 16. d4 $1 g4 17. d5+ {Every king move allows White to
escape, for example} Kd7 18. Bg5 Qh5 19. Nxe4 {This line is a beautiful
example of the kind of piece coordination White is looking for.}) 13. Ncxe4 Qe7
14. Nxd6 Qxd6 15. d3 {[#] In my games against the computer, I had developed
five principles for playing this variation: 1) Coordinate my pieces (the line
we just saw is a good example). 2) Keep files closed as long as possible. This
is necessary because Black has a 3-2 majority in straight-moving pieces. My
advantage lies in diagonals for the bishops and squares for the knight. 3)
Trade a knight for bishop if possible. This gives White two unopposed bishops, a huge
advantage. Two bishops plus two pawns are very nearly full compensation for a Q. Note
that my last move accomplished this part of the strategy. 4) Do not cash in
too early. Black will often try to give back an exchange to relieve the
pressure, but if White agrees too early his advantage will dissipate. 5) Keep
Black's queen under lock and key.  JS Interestingly my engine, Houdini, is
perfectly happy with White by now.} Raf8 16. Bf3+ (16. Be3 {would violate
principles 3 and 5: it gives away one of my two bishops, and allows Black's
queen to start running rampage after} Nd5 17. Rae1 Nxe3 18. Rxe3 Qd4 19. Rfe1
Qxb2) 16... Kd7 17. c3 {GM Victor Mikhalevski, who watched the game, wanted me
to play 17. Bxb7 here. However, this violates principle 4: "Do not cash in too
early." Instead I played 17. c3, in accordance with principle 5: "Keep
Black's queen under lock and key."} Nd5 18. g3 {As before I am in no hurry,
and play a simple defensive move to keep lines closed.} h6 19. Ne4 Qc7 20. b4
$1 cxb4 $2 {In my opinion, this is Black's only significant mistake after move
5. He should play 20. ... b6. The text move opens some lines, but in a really
good way for White.} 21. axb4 b6 (21... Nxc3 22. Nc5+) 22. Bd2 Rf7 23. c4 {
The "creeping forward" strategy begins. Black's pieces struggle to find safe
squares.} Nf6 24. Bc3 Ke7 (24... Nxe4 25. Bxe4 {and White's bishops dominate
the board. With no open files, Black's rooks are almost useless.}) 25. Be5 Qd7
26. Nd6 Rd8 {[#]} (26... Qxd6 27. Bxd6+ Kxd6 28. Ra6 {will win a second pawn
after R1a1 and c5+.}) 27. Nxf7 $6 {Oh, no! I violated principle 4, "Don't cash
in too soon!" Better was 27. b5, continuing to build my advantage. There is no
hurry to win Black's pitiful rook.} Kxf7 28. d4 Kg6 {David said that he felt
as if his position was lost after move 24 and he was now just playing to
confuse me. A better way to confuse the issue might have been 28. ... b5.} 29.

Ne8 ({The most attractive finish would have been} 33... Ng4 {when White wins
with the beautiful sweeper-sealer} 34. f5+ $1 {This dual-purpose move seals
the square f5 so that Rxg7 mate is threatened. It also opens the diagonal of
the bishop on e5 so that it defends g3 -- an important point after.} Kh7 (34...

his queen.} Kf5 {[#]} 36. Be4+ ({JS It seems a little sad to cash in this way
and indeed Rf8 was totally winning though White does have to be a little
careful.} 36. Rf7+ Kg6 37. Rf8 Nd6 38. Bxd6 ({Not} 38. cxd6 $2 Rc2+ 39. Kg3 $2
Rc3 {and Black wins!}) 38... Rxf8 {and either Be4+ or simply Bxf8}) 36... Qxe4+
37. Rxe4 {Thirty-one moves after sacrificing my queen, I win it back, with
interest.} Kxe4 38. Ra5 Nc7 39. Bxg7 Kxf4 40. Be5+ Kg4 41. g6 Kxh4 42. g7 Rg8
43. Ra7 (43. Bxc7 $2 Rxg7+) 43... Nd5 44. Rf7 Ne3+ 45. Kf3 Ng4 46. c6 {[#] JS
What a lovely game! The queen is the most powerful piece on the chessboard but
only effective if she has something to attack. Here Dana defended all of his
pieces and left her looking singularly useless.} 1-0

Rhf8 22. Ne5 Bxe5 23. Bxe5+ Ka8 {[#] Which do you like better: White's bishops

almost a pawn to Black - 0, 98. Interestingly Fritz 15 gives it as just -.26
after 24 h4 and Komodo 10 gives h4 as -0.6. One important lesson is that these
assessments are just all numbers and you shouldn't take too much notice of
them unless they become really definite.} 24. Bg6 $6 {Missing a tactical shot.

accepted -- in a completely winning position! Argh! This would have been my
first win ever over a GM, and a fitting sequel to the Pruess game. Why did I
accept? Because a draw would clinch the under-2300 prize for me (a very nice
chunk of money). Because I did not grasp how strong 48.c4+ was. Because my
emotions got the better of me. Because I was worried about getting into time
trouble and messing up the endgame. I accepted the draw in the full knowledge
that I was taking the easy way out, and this game would forever be "what might
have been." It was a moment of cowardice, and very appropriate for the Agony
column. Here's how the game could have ended: JS It's a real shame that Dana
didn't find the nerve to refuse the draw. But draw offers do change the
dynamic of the battle and if he'd refused and failed to see c4+ and b4 then he
could have got into trouble later by feeling that he had to press or
regretting refusing the offer.} 48. c4+ Kb6 (48... Ka6 49. Ra2+ Kb6 50. Ba5+
