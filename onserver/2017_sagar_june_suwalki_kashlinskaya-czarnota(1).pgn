1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bh4 Be7 {Czarnota goes for
a simple line rather than the complexities of the Moscow Variation.} 7. e3 O-O
8. Bd3 Nbd7 9. O-O dxc4 10. Bxc4 b5 11. Bd3 a6 12. Bxf6 Nxf6 13. Ne4 {White's
play has been pretty simple, but nothing special. Black has to be just careful
that he doesn't end up in a bind, unable to execute the c5 break.} Nd7 14. Rc1
Bb7 15. Bb1 Qc7 $6 (15... f5 $5 {would have solved Black's opening issues
because if the knight moves, then c6-c5 will solve all of Black's problems.}
16. Nc5 Nxc5 17. dxc5 Qxd1 18. Rfxd1 Rfd8 $11 {And Black should not have any
problems here as the c5 pawn is weak.}) 16. Qc2 g6 (16... f5 17. Ng3 c5 18.
dxc5 Qxc5 19. Qb3 Qd5 (19... Qb6 20. Nxf5 $18) 20. Rc7 Qd6 $13) 17. h4 {
Alina's play is pretty direct.} c5 {Czarnota tries to break free and it looks
pretty thematic. He is countering a flank attack with a brek in the centre,
but he lands in a lost position.} (17... f5 {would have been met with the
strong} 18. Qb3 $5 fxe4 19. Qxe6+ Rf7 20. Qxg6+ Rg7 21. Qe6+ Kh8 22. Qxh6+ Rh7
23. Qe6 $40 {White has a strong attack.}) 18. dxc5 Bxe4 (18... Rac8 $5 {
should have been considered, but it is not a human move especially because b4
is possible.}) 19. Qxe4 Nxc5 20. h5 $1 {Not caring about the attacked queen.}
Qb6 (20... Nxe4 21. Rxc7 Bd8 22. Rc6 Ng5 23. Nxg5 Bxg5 24. hxg6 $16 {Black's
chances of surviving here are pretty grim.}) 21. Qc2 Rac8 22. hxg6 f5 23. b4
Nd7 24. Qb3 (24. Qxc8 {was also winning.}) 24... Kg7 25. Nd4 Kf6 26. g7 Rg8 27.
Bxf5 $1 {The crushing blow.} Rxc1 28. Rxc1 Ne5 (28... exf5 29. Qxg8 $18) 29.
Rc6 $1 {A very nice finishing stroke. e6 falls and so does the black king.} 1-0
