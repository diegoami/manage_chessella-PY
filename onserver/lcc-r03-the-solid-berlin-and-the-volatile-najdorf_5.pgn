$5 {Howell decides to pick up a pawn at the cost of giving up his strong dark
squared bishop.} 15. Nxd4 Rxd4 16. b3 $14 {White has excellent compensation
thanks to his two bishops and also because none of the Black's minor pieces are
playing in the game.} Rdd8 17. Be3 Kf8 18. Nc3 Nec7 19. Ne4 f6 20. Kf1 Bf7 21.
Nd2 Nb4 22. Ne4 Nba6 23. Rab1 {Of course Pert doesn't repeat with Nd2 again,
instead tries to play for a win. After all he is point down in the match.} Nb4
$2 {A tactical blunder by Howell.} (23... b6 {was better but it is not a good
feeling to weaken the long diagonal.}) 24. Nxf6 $1 exf6 25. Bc5+ Ke8 26. Bxb4
$16 {White not only has restored the material equilibrium but also has the
bishop pair. This is quite a tangible advantage to White. The game went on for
another 50 moves but White was unable to make the most of his edge and the game
ended in a draw.} Rd7 27. Rc3 Rad8 28. Ke1 Ne6 29. Re3 Bg8 30. Ba5 Rc8 31. Rd1
