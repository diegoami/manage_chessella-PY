$5 {We reached the standard position of the Slav Defence and Nakamura makes
this little rook move. What is the idea of this one? Well White intends to play
c5. However, right now it was not possible as 8.c5 would be met with 8... b6!?
and then b4 with a5, when it is no longer possible to play a3 as the rook on a1
would be hanging after axb4. But once you move your rook away from a1, then the
c5 followed by b4 ideas become possible.} Nbd7 9. c5 a5 {It is funny that this
same idea of Rb1 followed by c5 was first employed by Topalov in his World
Championship match in Elista against Kramnik in 2006! Kramnik had responded
very well with black and in this game Topalov basically uses all the manouvres
and ideas of his old foe.} 10. a3 Be7 11. g3 e5 12. Bg2 e4 13. b4 axb4 14. axb4
Nf8 $5 {Transferring the knight to e6 before castling was also done by
Kramnik.} 15. b5 Ne6 16. Bd2 O-O (16... b6 {could have been an interesting
idea.} 17. cxb6 Qxb6 18. O-O $14) 17. Na4 Ng5 18. h4 (18. O-O { was a much
better way to continue.}) 18... Nf3+ 19. Bxf3 exf3 20. bxc6 bxc6 21. Nc3
{[#]Now it seems as if White would just win the pawn on f3 and then 0-0 and be
a simple pawn up. But Topalov had prepared a nice sacrifice!} (21. Nb6 Ra2
$132) 21... Bxc5 $1 {The exclamation is not for the objective evaluation of the
move. It is for the practical implications. They are easy to calculate for
humans and hence practically this is an excellent idea.} 22. dxc5 d4 23. exd4

O-O Qxd2 $11) 25... Qc4 $1 $17 {Very strong move threatening Re8+. White is
almost busted.}) 24... Qg4 25. Re1 (25. Be3 $2 {It is important for the queen
on d1 to keep an eye on f3 and hence this is a blunder.} Rfd8 $1 26. Qb3 Qh3
$19) (25. Bf4 $5 {This looks like a natural idea.} Rfd8 26. Bd6 Ra3 $1 { The
knight cannot move as then f3 would be defended and Qh3 comes in.} 27. Qd3 (27.
Rc1 $2 Ne4 28. Nxe4 Qh3 $17) 27... Nd5 28. Rbc1 (28. Rfc1 Re8 $1 $17 { The main
point is that White has absolutely no moves! Black has attacking ideas with
Re2, and he can also strengthen his position with Kh7. All in all this is just
lost for White.}) 28... Re8 29. Kh2 Re2 $1 $19 {It's the same story - Zugzwang
like position and White is once again lost.}) 25... Rfd8 26. Rb2 Rd4 27. Re7

28... Rf8 $1 {How do you meet the threat of Qh3 now?} 29. Qd1 Rfd8 30. Qb3 Rf8
{Time to make a draw?} 31. Nd1 $1 {Not really. Once again the exclamation mark
is not for the objective evaluation of the position but for the fighting spirit
shown by Nakamura.} Nd5 (31... Qf5 {Engines suggest this as the best move in
the position. So what exactly is the idea of this move? Look a little deeper
with your tactical eye and you will see that the threat is Rxh4! White must do
something against it immediately.} 32. Re3 {looks like the only defensive move
to get rid of the f3 pawn.} (32. Ne3 Qh3 33. Qd1 { Now this looks simply
winning for White as the f3 pawn is falling. But Black has a nice double
attack.} Nd5 $1 $19) 32... Qd7 $1 33. Rxf3 Rxd2 34. Rxd2 Qxd2 $15 {The material
is even and Black cannot be worse, maybe a tad better.}) 32. Re5 Kh7 {Topalov
is ambitious. He sees that something like Rb8 can give him a win if he can
manage to deflect the white queen and prepare Qh3. But as it turns out this is
just too speculative and Nakamura already has a winning position.} (32... Nf6
{With the idea of Qd7 made sense.}) 33. Kh2 $1 {Stopping a direct Qh3 at some
point.} Nf6 34. Be3 Rb8 {As Topalov nicely put it - the only problem with this
move is that it is losing!} 35. Qxb8 Rxd1 {How do you meet the threat of Rh1
followed by Qh3? Only one move.} 36. Rb1 Qd7 $5 37. Rg5 $1 {This was the move
that was completely overlooked by Topalov.} (37. Rxd1 $2 Ng4+ 38. Kh3 Nxf2+ 39.
Kh2 Qh3+ 40. Kg1 Qg2#) 37... Ne4 38. Rxd1 Qxd1 39. Qf4 { An edge of the seat
entertainer.} 1-0
