1. e4 e5 {"Mickey" Adams is addicted to 1...e5 against 1.e4.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
Nf6 (3... a6 {The Spanish is another opening which Adams opts for.}) 4. d3 {
In general, Caruana is not a fan of the Berlin Endgame.} Bc5 5. c3 O-O 6. O-O Re8
7. Bg5 h6 8. Bh4 a6 9. Bc4 d6 {After some transposition, we have a form of
Italian Defense on the board. It is interesting that in the only game played
in this line, we see Eljanov with the black pieces.} 10. Nbd2 $146 (10. a4 g5 11.

0-1 (35) Navara,D (2742)-Eljanov,P (2739) Baku 2016}) 10... Ba7 11. a4 Be6 12.
a5 {White gains some space on the queenside but Adams knows how to neutralize
White's pressure.} Bxc4 13. Nxc4 Re6 $1 {A strong move which takes away the
burden of defending the knight on f6 from Black's queen.} 14. Ne3 Bxe3 $1 {
Good judgement by Adams.} 15. fxe3 d5 16. d4 $1 {The only way for White to
fight for an advantage.} exd4 (16... dxe4 17. Nxe5 Nxe5 18. dxe5 Qxd1 19.
Raxd1 Ng4 20. Rd7 Rf8 $1 21. Rxc7 Rxe5 22. Rxb7 Rxa5 {was probably not Adams'
cup of tea.}) 17. Bxf6 (17. Nxd4 Nxd4 18. exd5 Qxd5 19. Bxf6 Ne2+ 20. Qxe2 gxf6
21. Ra4 $1 {may have caused more troubles for Black.}) 17... Rxf6 18. e5 Re6
19. exd4 f6 $1 {Black neutralizes White's superior pawn structure.} 20.
Re1 Qd7 21. Qb3 fxe5 22. dxe5 Rf8 23. Re3 (23. Qxb7 Rxf3 24. gxf3 Rg6+ 25. Kf2
Qh3 {is too dangerous for White.}) 23... Rg6 24. Kh1 Nd8 25. Rd1 c6 26. c4 d4 {[#] Black has solved all of his problems but the dust has not settled yet.} 27. Qc2 Rg4 28. h3 Rgf4 29. b4 Rxf3 $6 {This move does not lose but it gives away Black's slight edge.} (29... Ne6 30. Red3 Qf7 {with a slight edge for Black.}) 30. Rxf3 Rxf3 31. gxf3 Qxh3+ 32. Kg1 Qg3+ $6 {The dubious mark is not because it makes the Englishman's position worse but it makes it harder for him to
keep the balance.} (32... Ne6 33. Qe4 Ng5 34. Qf4 Nxf3+ 35. Kf2 Ng5 36. Qxd4
Qf3+ 37. Ke1 Ne6 {was much better for Black from a practical point of view.}) 33.
Qg2 Qxe5 34. f4 $1 {A very deep move by Caruana! He voluntarily gives up a pawn to activate his rook. A truly brilliant strategic idea!} Qxf4 35. Re1 Qf6 36. Qg4 {[#] Black is up material but his pawns are not advanced enough and his knight starts to feel uncomfortable. The tension has culminated and as they close to the time control, Adams goes astray.} Nf7 $4 (36... Kh7 {was
necessary and White cannot improve.}) 37. Re8+ Kh7 38. Re6 $1 {This is what
Adams missed. The queen exchange is forced and the rook dominates the knight. Black's
three pawns are to no avail in this situation.} Qg5 39. Qxg5 Nxg5 40. Re7 c5 {
This doesn't help either.} 41. b5 axb5 42. cxb5 c4 43. Kf2 {Caruana avoids any
sort of complications. Black's pawns are doomed.} c3 44. Ke2 Nh3 45. Rf7 {
And so does his knight now. White's pawn will reach the eight rank soon. A brilliant victory for Caruana which puts him back on the second place in world rating list. He constantly created problems for Adams and unfortunately for the Englishman, he failed to solve the most crucial one.} 1-0
