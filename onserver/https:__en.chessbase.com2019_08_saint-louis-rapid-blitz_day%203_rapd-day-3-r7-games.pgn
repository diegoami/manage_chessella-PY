times. A surprise in the opening is always an important psychological device,
in a proper opening, instead of a 'setup'. From the body language of the
players, it appeared that Aronian was quite pleased with the game at this
point]} ({Caruana had played a game recently in the line, which probably
enabled Aronian to 'target' him here:} 10... Rb8 11. Bc4 Bg4 12. h3 Bh5 {

Qg6 {[Somewhere around here, Caruana's position didn't look very encouraging:
after sacrificing the pawn, though he holds enough compensation, it is
difficult to suggest something tangible for him to DO, which became obvious in
the further course of the game]} ({Black developed the knight because of the

unnerved that his position wasn't moving anywhere]} (28. g3 $142 {[Simply, not
changing his piece position and giving room for his king at g2 and awaiting
black's actions]} Nb7 (28... c5 29. dxc5 Rxc5 30. Qa2 $11) 29. Nb1 $1 {aiming

preparation}) 12. Qa3 e5 13. d5 Nd4 14. Nb5 $1 {[When Carlsen played this, it

sacrifice]} Nxc6 $2 (15... Nxf3+ 16. gxf3 bxc6 17. Rxc6 Rb8 {was another way
to create activity and counterplay, but black doesn't have any real targets in

have fought back in the game, after he missed his chances in the opening
stages]} 16. Nbxd4 exd4 17. Bxd4 Bxd4 18. Nxd4 Re8 {and though white is still
better, there is considerable amount of counterplay for black, especially in a

- it's one of those positions where you start hating life itself.

out of desperation]} Nxe4 19. Bxf8 Bxf8 20. Qe3 Nc5 $2 (20... f5 21. O-O $16)

dark bishop - sitting on b4 rather than g7!]} 9. a3 Ba5 {[#]} 10. a4 $6 {
