1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. h3 g6 {The reason that
this move is not very popular is that many consider 6.h3 to be more useful
generally than 6...a6 in the normal Dragon. That, however, is truly up to
debate.} 7. g3 Nc6 8. Be3 {An example of h3 being useful, normally this runs
into Ng4.} Bg7 9. Bg2 O-O 10. O-O Nd7 11. b3 Nxd4 12. Bxd4 Bxd4 13. Qxd4 {
Black plays unambitiously, hoping to defend a solid though slightly worse
position.} b6 14. Nd5 Bb7 15. c4 e5 {The weakness on d6 is not easy to target,
while Black hopes to use the break b5 and the control over the dark squares to
create counterplay.} (15... b5 {immediately was also possible.}) 16. Qe3 (16.
Qd2 {keeping pressure on d6 rather than on b6, seemed more logical. Black is
going to play b5 anyway.}) 16... b5 17. Rac1 bxc4 18. Rxc4 Bxd5 19. exd5 { The
eternal fight between the bishop and the knight. In this instance the knight
doesn't have many good anchor squares (it will get kicked out of c5 if it goes
there), on the other hand the bishop on g2 causes no great impression.} a5 20.
Rfc1 Nc5 21. a3 f5 $6 {Black gains space, but truly he simply weakens his
position.} (21... a4 {it's strange Nakamura did not go for this option} 22.
bxa4 $1 (22. b4 {strategically Black usually does not want to allow this, but
after} Nb3 {the knight heads for the d4 square}) 22... Qd7 {and the knight is
superb on c5.}) 22. b4 axb4 23. axb4 Nd7 24. Rc6 f4 25. gxf4 $1 {Black has to
decide how to lose a pawn} exf4 (25... Rxf4 26. Rxd6 Qe7 27. Re6 $1 Qxb4 28. d6
$1 {and with the bishop activated Black's position is difficult, but not
without resources:} (28. Rc7 {might be more precise}) 28... Ra3 29. Qe2 Qd4 {
with counterplay}) 26. Qe6+ Rf7 27. Qxd6 Qg5 {again Black finds resources.
Thanks to the exchange of the g-pawn, White's king is exposed and Nakamura
clings on to this as his hope to battle White's passed pawns.} 28. Kh1 (28.
Rc8+ Rxc8 (28... Kg7 29. h4 $1 {doesn't work for Black}) 29. Rxc8+ Kg7 30. Kh1
f3 31. Bf1 {was a better version of the game}) 28... f3 29. Bf1 Nf6 {The game
is certainly sharp. White is up material but his king is weak, and so are his
pawns. Black's king isn't particularly save either, and any move can be a fatal
mistake.} 30. Qe6 $6 {Now Nakamura finds strong counterplay} (30. Qg3 Qxg3 31.
fxg3 Ra2 32. b5 Rb2 {is better for White, despite the passed position of the f2
pawn}) 30... Kg7 {Unpinning the rook is an obvious start} 31. Rc7 Rxc7 $1 32.
Rxc7+ Kh6 $1 {Black's king now hides on h6, where it is much safer than on g8.
With the weakness of White's king it is Carlsen that has to be careful} 33. Qe1
Ra2 34. Re7 Ng4 {Forcing the result.} (34... Qxd5 {and Black isn't in much
danger, but he is not better either.}) 35. hxg4 Qh4+ 36. Kg1 Qxg4+ 37. Kh1 Qh4+
38. Kg1 Qg4+ 39. Kh1 Qh4+ 40. Kg1 Qg4+ 1/2-1/2
