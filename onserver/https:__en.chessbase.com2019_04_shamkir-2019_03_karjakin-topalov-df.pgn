Bb6 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Be3 Ba5 {In this system, Black generally has to be quite
willing to part with the bishop pair. However, considering the prospectless 
(though not worse!) position Black ended up in after a few moves, I think I
prefer offering the other bishop first!} (10... Bg4 {was picked in a European
Championship game from last week.} 11. h3 Bh5 12. Qc2 Ba5 13. Be2 (13. O-O Nxc3

who has practical chances}) 29. Rb2 Nc4 (29... bxc3 30. Rxb7 Qxb7 31. Rxc3 Qb2
32. Rxc6 Nxd4 {is the obvious way to try and play against White's centre, but
as so often, winning those pawns just ends up clearing space for the
bishop-pair behind them. So Black's main way of continuing here will be to rid
the world of that bishop-pair first. The following is of course computer
analysis and I'm not sure it's wise to try and play this way over the board.}
