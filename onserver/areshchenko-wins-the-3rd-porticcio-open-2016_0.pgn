{Areshchenko is very strong with the white pieces and is very well updated with
modern theory. It is especially useful to see how he plays the Ruy Lopez with
the white pieces.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1
b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 Na5 10. Bc2 c5 11. d4 Qc7 12. Nbd2 {The Chigorin
Variation in the Ruy Lopez has been played many times and all has been seen
numerous times. cxd4 is one way for Black to play now. But instead Grandelius
chooses for the other popular way to play with ...Bd7.} Bd7 13. Nf1 Nc4 14. b3
Nb6 15. Ne3 {Areshchenko follows the game between MVL-Grandelius which had
ended in a quick draw for the Swedish GM. It was natural that Alexander had
come with some new ideas.} c4 16. Ba3 Rfe8 (16... cxb3 17. axb3 Qxc3 18. dxe5
$18) 17. Qd2 Bf8 18. Rad1 cxb3 19. axb3 a5 20. Rc1 $5 {A new move that keeps
the pressure on the position.} ({This is how Maxime Vachier reacted when he
reached this position with the white pieces.} 20. dxe5 dxe5 21. Bxf8 Kxf8 22.

the tactical opportunity.} dxe5 26. Bxf8 Kxf8 (26... Rxf8 27. Nxe5 $16) 27. c4
$1 {[%cal Gc3c4] [#]This move is extremely strong although at first sight it
might seem that it is nothing special. Isn't that the reason why a strong
player like Grandelius missed it? The check on b4 is going to cause tremendous
problems for Black.} Kg8 (27... bxc4 28. Qb4+ Kg8 29. Nxc4 Rb8 30. Nd6 $1 $18
(30. Rb1 {is equally good.})) 28. cxb5 {Although White hasn't won a pawn yet as
the one on e4 is hanging, he is clearly better.} Nxe4 29. Bxe4 Qxe4 30. Nc4 $1
{Once again sharp tactical eye shown by Alexander. Nd6 is threatened and the
knight must be taken.} Nxc4 31. Qxd7 Qa8 {The queen had to retreat in such a
way that Rxc4 would not hang the rook on e8.} (31... Qf4 32. Nxe5 $1 Nb6 33.

he can, but the position is just lost.} 36. Qg5 $1 { Not an easy move to make
the idea is to challenge the rook on the d-file with Red1.} h6 37. Nf6+ $1 Kf8

a perfect game by Areshchenko. It could be safe to say that almost all his
moves were flawless.} 1-0
