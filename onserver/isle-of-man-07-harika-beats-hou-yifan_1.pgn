1. d4 Nf6 2. c4
e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+ 4. Nbd2 O-O 5. a3 Be7 6. e4 d6 $5 {These systems are more
positional in nature.} (6... d5 {is the other main move in the position
that leads to very aggressive positions after} 7. e5 Nfd7 8. Bd3 c5 9.
h4 $5) 7. Bd3 Nbd7 8. O-O e5 9. b4 exd4 10. Nxd4 Re8 11. Bb2 Bf8 { Black
plays in typical Nimzowitsch style. Restraint against the e4 pawn and
then slowly and steadily looking out for the d6-d5 break.} 12. Qc2 c6
13. N4b3 b6 $6 (13... Ne5 14. Be2 Ng6 {looked more to the point, but after}
15. f4 Bd7 16. Rae1 {White looks better.}) 14. f4 $1 g6 15. Rae1 {White's
play is just so natural!} Bb7 16. e5 $1 {The best part about White's play
is that he hardly wastes time. Everything is in place so let's get going!}
Nh5 17. c5 $1 { Amazing move. White wants to destroy the d6 pawn so that
he can either play f4-f5 or open the f-file for his rooks. And the other
interesting point to note is that Harika too beat Hou Yifan with her pawns
on e5 and c5!} (17. f5 dxe5 {is better for White but not as much as in
the game.}) 17... d5 (17... dxc5 18. f5 $1 $18) (17... dxe5 18. fxe5 Bg7
19. Bc4 $18) 18. f5 {S.L. Narayanan makes it look so easy!} Qg5 19. Nf3
Qg4 20. e6 fxe6 21. fxe6 (21. fxg6 {was also quite strong.}) 21... Ndf6
(21... Rxe6 22. h3 $18) 22. h3 Qf4 23. Bxg6 hxg6 24. Qxg6+ Bg7 25. Ng5
Qg3 26. Be5 Qh4 27. Nd4 {The knight is coming to f5 and in general the
black king is just a few moves away from being mated! What a resounding
victory for the GM from Kerala!} 1-0
