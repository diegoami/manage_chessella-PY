1. e4 c5 {The only non e4-e5 game of the round and the only decisive one. Of
course it had to be the Sicilian!} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6
6. h3 {The h3 line has become quite popular in the last year or two. Mainly it
seems to be fashion more than the objective strength of the move. White gots
pretty much nothing in the main lines (Be3, Bc4, Bg5) and tried to deviate with
6.h3 and is enjoying good results.} e5 7. Nde2 {If White were to achieve g4 and
Ng3 now he would get a very nice harmonious position. This explains Black's
next move.} h5 8. g3 Nbd7 9. Bg2 b5 10. Nd5 {is quite rare. It was played by
Navara just a few days ago at the European Team Championships and this must
have caught MVL's attention.} (10. O-O {is the mian move.}) 10... Nxd5 11. Qxd5
Rb8 (11... Nb6 $5) (11... Qc7 $5 {was Djukic's choice against Navara. The rook
is taboo in the corner because of Nb6.}) 12. Be3 Be7 13. Qd2 Nf6 14. O-O O-O
15. Kh2 Bb7 16. Nc3 Rc8 17. a4 b4 18. Nd5 Nxd5 19. exd5 { The last few moves
have been pretty normal. White has got nothing special out of the opening. In
fact Black can opt for quick queenside play with Qa5, Rc4 and Rfc8.} a5 (19...
Qa5 $5 {[%cal Gc8c4,Gf8c8] was pretty good.}) 20. Qe2 Bg5 $1 21. Bxg5 (21. Qxh5
Bxe3 22. fxe3 Rxc2 $36) 21... Qxg5 22. h4 Qf6 23. Qb5 Qe7 24. Qxa5 Rxc2 25.
Rac1 (25. Qxb4 Qc7 {with Ba6 and Rb8 to follow up Black will surely recover his
pawn.}) 25... Rxb2 26. Rb1 Ra2 27. Qxb4 Ba6 28. Qb3 Bxf1 $2 (28... Rd2 $11
{Keeping the rook was important.}) 29. Qxa2 Bxg2 30. Kxg2 { Because of the
exchange manoeuvre initiated by Topalov, White has been left with a strong
passed pawn on a-file. The first player is better here.} Ra8 $6 ( 30... e4
{Good or bad it was necessary to create play on the kingside.} 31. a5 (31. Rb3
Qe5 32. Qd2 f5 $132) 31... e3 $1 {and Black could cling on.}) 31. a5 { Now
White gets an extra tempo to push his pawn and this makes a huge difference.}
e4 32. Rb3 $1 {Good prophylactic play, stopping e4-e3.} f5 (32... Qe5 33. a6
Qxd5 34. Rb8+ $18 {[%cal Ga2d5] This is also one move which wouldn't have been
possible had the rook been on f8.}) 33. Qd2 $6 (33. a6 f4 34. Rb7 Qe5 (34...
f3+ 35. Kh2 $18) 35. a7 {would have had been immediate curtains for Black.})
33... Qc7 (33... Qf7 {was more tenacious.}) 34. Qb2 Rxa5 $6 (34... Qxa5 35. Rb7
Qa1 36. Rxg7+ Kh8 {and believe it or not, Black can survive this after} 37.
Qxa1 Rxa1 38. Rg5 Kh7 39. Rxf5 Kg6 40. Rg5+ Kh6 $16 { Is this winning? I am not
so sure. Rd1 is coming up and the d5 pawn is weak. Meanwhile it's not easy to
get the white king into the game.}) 35. Rb7 Ra2 { This was the resource Topalov
was banking on.} 36. Qb5 Rxf2+ $2 (36... Qc2 $2 37. Qe8+ Kh7 38. Qxh5+ Kg8 39.
Rb8+ Qc8 40. Rxc8#) (36... Qc1 $1 {was the best defence.} 37. Qe8+ Kh7 38.
Qxh5+ Qh6 39. Qxf5+ Qg6 40. Qf4 $16 {White should win this, but it will require
some work to be done.}) 37. Kxf2 Qc2+ 38. Qe2 { There is absolutely no
perpetual and Topalov had to resign the game. Quite an unfortunate defeat for
the Bulgarian who played the opening and the early middlegame quite well.} 1-0
