21. h6 {[#]} a3 $5 {Instead of worsening his "bad" bishop even more with 21...
g6 Buhmann goes for a counterattack.} 22. b3 Qxc3 23. Qxc3 Rxc3 24. hxg7 Rc2 $1
{That was Black's idea. Suddenly White's king is in danger and the white rook
an a1 looks awkward.} 25. Rxh7 Bc8 $2 {[#] There are only a few pieces left on
the board but the position is complicated. White has threats on the kingside
but Black should have had faith in his counterattack. The unfortunate retreat
of the bishop gives White time to bring his rook on a1 into play - and then
White's position is fine indeed.} ({After} 25... Rac8 $1 26. Rh8+ Kxg7 27. Rh7+
