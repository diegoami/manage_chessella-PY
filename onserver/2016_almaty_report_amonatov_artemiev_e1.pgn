{For those who are not completely familiar with the Blitz world, the GM from
Tajikistan has a worldwide reputation of being a very dangerous player in this
field. Indeed, he showed his class in this event, winning it in style with a
remarkable 16/22, four wins in a row in the end and a 2-0 in the final round
against Mamedyarov! This brought him an envyable 30 000 USD and the 1st place;
not bad for a weekend:)} 35. Kh2 {However, we all need just a bit of 'luck' or
a smile from Caissa now and then... Farrukh could have lost on the spot here
had his opponent been warned on the devilish trap set by White.} Qd5 {In a
classical game this move would deserve a question mark but in Blitz... I am
reluctant using it, as I remember very well how my pieces were flying all over
the board, not seeing mate in two moves etc.} ({Black is winning after either
capture on e5 but I prefer:} 35... Qxe5 $1 36. fxe5 Bxe5+ {followed by Rxd1
and 0-1.}) 36. Qc7+ Kg8 37. Rxd4 $1 {There are a lot of "Oups" moments in
chess, especially in Blitz, and this was a very good turn of events for the
tournament winner.} 1-0
