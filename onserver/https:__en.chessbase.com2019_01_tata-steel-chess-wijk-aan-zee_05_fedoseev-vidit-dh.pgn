1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 d5 7. e3 {This is
a relatively rare move at this juncture. White modestly develops while hoping
that his extra bishop will grant him chances for an advantage when the
position later opens up.} (7. Nf3 {and}) (7. Bg5 {are both far more common. I
have tested both of these moves recently, but Black appears to have worked out
some convincing replies.}) 7... b6 8. cxd5 exd5 9. Bd3 Ba6 10. Ne2 (10. Bxa6 {
featured in the game Nakamura-Anand, Norway Chess 2015:} Nxa6 11. Qd3 Qc8 12.
Ne2 c5 13. b3 cxd4 14. exd4 Nc7 {with an equal position.}) 10... c5 11. b3 Ne4
12. Qc2 Bxd3 13. Qxd3 Nc6 14. Bb2 cxd4 {Black resolves the central tension but
willingly saddles himself with the famous insolated d-pawn. As compensation,
he is ahead in development and his major pieces will be quick to find good
squares.} 15. Nxd4 Nc5 16. Qd1 Nxd4 17. Bxd4 (17. Qxd4 $2 {would be met
strongly by:} Qg5 $1 $17 {[%cal Gg5g2,Gc5b3]}) 17... Ne6 18. O-O Qh4 19. Bb2
Rad8 20. Rc1 Rd7 21. f4 {Commital, and true to Fedoseev's style. White hints
at a kingside attack though in truth this move is aimed at limiting the scope
of Black's knight.} (21. Qf3 {might have been enough for a small (if somewhat
symbolic) advantage:} Rfd8 22. Rfd1 Qe4 (22... d4 $6 23. g3 Qe7 24. exd4 $14)
23. Kf1) ({moves such as} 21. Rc3 $5 {[%cal Gc3d3] were also on the radar.})
21... Qe7 {This feels slightly too passive.} ({There was no reason to refrain
from} 21... Nc5 $11 {[%cal Gc5e4] with the simple idea of bringing the knight
round to the newly-created outpost on e4.}) 22. b4 $1 {Further restricting the
black knight.} f6 (22... d4 {would have been an immediate attempt to liquidate
the centre:} 23. e4 d3 $132) 23. Qb3 Qf7 24. Rfd1 Rfd8 25. h3 (25. Rc6 $1 $14 {
[%cal Ga3a5] would keep an eye on the e6-knight and prevent Black's next.})
25... Qg6 $1 26. a4 Qe4 $11 {Now play is balanced.} 27. a5 bxa5 28. bxa5 Kf7

{[%csl Gh5]} 42. f5 Ng5 43. Qg3 $6 {Knowing Fedoseev, he was still habouring
hopes of a victory here. However Black's queen and knight are simply too
active.} ({It would have been pragmatic to try and force an immediate draw:} 
43. Qa4 Qxe1 (43... Nf3+ 44. Kg3 {changes nothing:} Nxe1 45. Qd7+) 44. Qd7+ Kg8
45. Qe8+ Kh7 46. Qh5+ {with perpetual check.}) 43... Kg8 44. Bc3 Qb5 $1 $15 {
Vidit prevents any checks and prepares to push his a-pawn.} 45. Qc7 Ne4 46. Bd4
$6 (46. Ba5 {was safer, blockading the a-pawn.}) 46... a5 $17 47. Qe7 a4 48.

a3 55. Kg1 Qb4 56. Kh2 Qd6+ 57. Kg1 Qb4 58. Kh2 Qb3 59. Qa8 a2 60. Qe8 Qa3 {
It is hard to criticise this, as Vidit has played superbly over the past dozen
moves. Black could now have converted his advantage although the winning
concept is still difficult to comprehend, even with engine assistance:} (60...
Qb4 $1 {wins due to a strange type of zugzwang. White cannot give perpetual
check, while it is impossible to keep both his king and bishop on the correct
squares. One sample variation:} 61. Qh5+ Kg8 62. Qe8+ Qf8 63. Qa4 Qb8+ 64. Kg1
Qb1+ 65. Kh2 Nd6 $1 {(preventing Qe8+ ideas and attacking f5)} 66. Qd7 Nxf5 67.
Qe8+ Kh7 68. Qh5+ Nh6 $19 {and with a safe king the path to victory should be
straightforward.}) 61. Ba1 $2 {allowing Black another chance.} (61. Bb2 $1 {
draws, but once again this is difficult for the untrained human eye:} Qd6+ (
61... Qxb2 62. Qh5+ Kg8 63. Qe8+) 62. Kg1 Qb4 63. Qh5+ Kg8 64. Qe8+ Qf8 65. Qa4
$11 {and now, as opposed to the variation with 60...Qb4!, Black cannot gain
time by checking the white king.}) 61... Qd6+ $2 {Letting the win slip for
good.} (61... Qc5 {would win}) ({while} 61... Qb4 {is similar to the
variations above:} 62. Qh5+ Kg8 63. Qe8+ Qf8 64. Qa4 Qb8+ 65. Kg1 Qb1+ 66. Kh2
Nd6 $19) 62. Kg1 Qc5 63. Qg6+ Kg8 64. Qe8+ Qf8 65. Qa4 $1 {Now Black has no
checks so he must abandon the a-pawn. Fedoseev now defends accurately to
ensure the draw.} Qc8 66. Qxa2 Qc1+ (66... Qxf5 {should also eventually lead
to a draw, although Black can press forever.}) 67. Kh2 Qc7+ 68. Kg1 Qc1+ 69.
