{Sometimes you need patience - and zugzwang - to win a won endgame: The
following interesting duel which Remy Heimers sent to me with annotations is
an instructive example:} 64. Kb4 {Black is a piece up but winning this
position is everything but easy. White has a dangerous passed pawn on f6 which
has to be kept under permanent control. If Black's king were chained to this
pawn Black would not be able to win. Therefore Black's bishop has to control
the pawn to give the black king room for maneuver. If Black could simply beam
his bishop to e8, his task would be easy. However, even if Black sacrificed
his pawn on b5, his bishop would not come to e8. No, Black has to give the
pawn on b5 and and the pawn on h5 to bring his bishop to e8. Then he can bring
his king to the center - and then Black will be able to force White into
"zugzwang".} (64. Kb4 {In the game Black saw no way to convert his material
advantage into a win and agreed to a draw.}) 64... Be2 65. Kc5 {[%tqu "En",

the contrary. Black must be careful not to press too hard.} Kc8 69. Ka7 $1 (69.
