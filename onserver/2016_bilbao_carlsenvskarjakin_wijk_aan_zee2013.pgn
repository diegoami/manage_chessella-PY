1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 {It is not a secret that the opening is not Carlsen's
favourite area for duels of principle; he prefers the middlegame and the
endgame for that. The Reti Opening is just perfect for such an approach.} d5 3.

to make less sense to clear the c6-square with} 7... cxd5 {, but the move
remains playable, of course, see for instance Markowski,T (2564)-Fressinet,L

does not develop his queen so early, but it may well lead to a transposition.}

partly, since the c6-pawn is solidly defended. It all depends on whether White
can carry out the minoritys attack with b4-b5.} 11. Ne4 (11. Nb1 O-O 12. Nd2 {

tension, letting White do it if he wishes so.} ({Concretely, I am not sure

14. a3 Nd5 $1 {From this square, the knight inhibits the thematic b2-b4,
because of the possible occupation of the c3-square (sustained by ...Bf6, of
course). Still, Black is not 100% stable since the d4-pawn cannot be defended
along the d-file.} (14... a4 {is premature and would play into White's hands:}

axb4 Bf6 {[%cal Gd5c3]}) 16... Rfe8 {It is far from easy to evaluate this
position. It takes a lot of optimism to claim an advantage with White, but on
the other hand did Black achieve full equality? White's structure is more
flexible, his bishops are a potential danger and it would be only he who could
carry out certain pawn breaks, such as b2-b4 or e2-e4. Black has to limit
himself to parrying the small threats and in doing so he should also avoid
losing coordination. Karjakin will deal with this task for a long time, but
not long enough! So, for practical point of view, I would risk to asses the
position as a +/=.} 17. Qc4 Nc7 18. h4 a4 19. Bb4 {An interesting plan. White
needs the b4- and c5-squares for his major pieces, in order to start attacking
the a4- and d4- pawns.} (19. b4 {remains unappealing:} Nb5 20. Ra1 Bf6) 19...
