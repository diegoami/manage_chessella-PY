{Let us start looking at the game here. Before this, it was a Grunfeld and we
got to this position which, though perhaps almost equal, does hold a bit of
danger for Black. Bishops are superior to knights, and the kingside pawns will
be vulnerable to an attack by the light-squared diagonal user. This endgame is
a bit reminiscent of what Fischer called the "minor exchange".} Nf6 28. Bc4
Rxb2 (28... Rhe8+ 29. Kd4 Rbd8 $1 {Was the unnatural, but best way, to hold.
The point is that the rooks create an unsafe environment for the kings, which
makes it difficult for White to make progress.} 30. Rb7 Kc6+ 31. Kc3 Re3+ 32.
Kc2 Rd4 {for example}) 29. Rxb2 Re8+ 30. Kd4 {Notice how Black's knight is
uncomfortably controlled compared to White's bishop.} Re7 31. Rb8 Rd7 32. Rc8
Rb7 33. a6 $1 {Puttin in the squeeze. The rook can't stay on the seventh rank,
but there isn't enough time to create counterplay.} Rb4 (33... Re7 34. Bb5 {
and the surprising checkmate on c6 is not so easy to parry.}) 34. Kc3 Ra4 35.
Kb3 Nd7 36. Bb5 (36. Kxa4 Nb6+ 37. Kb5 Nxc8 38. Bg8 h6 {is no dangerous for
Black as there is no penetration square once the knight reaches e7}) 36... Ra5

43. Kc4 Rc1+ 44. Kd3 Rc7 45. Kd4 {Black has stabilized from now, but he is far
from out of danger.} Ke7 46. Ra8 Kd6 47. h4 $1 {Now phase two, if you will:
White advances a bit on the kingside to creat threats} Ke7 $2 {An unfortunate
timing} (47... Nb6 48. Rh8 Ke6 49. Re8+ Kd6 50. h5 {is still very hard to hold}
) 48. Bxd7 $1 {Nakamura does not miss his chances. The rook endgame is
hopeless.} Rxd7+ (48... Kxd7 49. Kd5 Ke7 50. Rh8 Kf6 51. Kd6 {and everything
falls apart} Rc2 {! the only way to resist} 52. Rxh7 Rxg2 53. Rxa7) 49. Ke5 Kf7
50. Rb8 {This is the killing maneuver. Any rook trade is hopeless.} Re7+ 51.
Kd5 Kf6 52. Rb7 Re5+ 53. Kd4 Ra5 54. Rxa7 {This endgame is sometimes a draw,
but not in this csae, with a weak kingside and the pawn on the sixth and not
the seventh, as you will find out why soon!} f4 55. Kc4 Ra2 56. Kc5 h5 57. Ra8
