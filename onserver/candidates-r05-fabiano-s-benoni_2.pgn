1. Nf3 $5 {Anish wants to stay away from Svidler's excellent home preparation
and just have a normal game of chess.} d5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. d4 Nf6 5. c4
c6 {By a transposition we have reached the popular solid variation of the
Fianchetto Grunfeld. As Peter said in the press conference: "It is funny that
people are trying to find weird move orders to force me into playing the
Grunfeld, which is clearly my strongest opening!"} 6. Qb3 O-O 7. O-O a5 $5 {
Svidler's main move is 7...Qb6 but he had played this once before against Pavel
Tregubov in 2004.} 8. cxd5 a4 9. Qd1 cxd5 10. Nc3 {The players could have
reached the same position with the pawn on a7 as well. What does having the
pawn on a4 mean? In some cases it can be a weakness, but it is also a strength
that confers a lot of space to Black on the queenside.} Ne4 11. Nd2 $146 (11.
Nxa4 {doesn't really make sense as after} Qa5 12. Nc3 (12. b3 b5 13. Nb2 Nc6
$44 {followed by Bf5 is a free flowing position for Black.}) 12... Nxc3 13.
bxc3 Qxc3 14. Bd2 Qc4 $11) 11... Nxc3 12. bxc3 Qa5 13. Qc2 Bf5 $6 {"I just
blanked out!" Svidler was quite critical about this move and rightly so. He
could have kept better control on the position by playing his bishop to e6
instead of f5.} (13... Be6 {with Rc8 coming up next. The opening has gone
really well for Black.}) 14. e4 dxe4 15. Nxe4 Nd7 16. Rb1 Qc7 17. Qe2 {White
definitely has a small edge now, mainly because his pieces are much better
co-ordinated. The rook on b1, the bishop on g2 and the dark squared bishop
coming to f4, it all looks pretty good for Anish.} Rfe8 18. Be3 (18. Bf4 e5 {
is fine for Black.}) 18... Rab8 19. Rb4 $1 {Giri wanted to stop Black from
playing e5 at all costs but was not able to do so. But this rook lift is
excellent. It puts pressure on the a4 pawn and also prepares doubling on the
b-file.} e5 20. Rc4 (20. d5 {was definitely an option} Bxe4 21. Rxe4 $5 { so
that Bf8 doesn't come with a tempo.} (21. Bxe4 Bf8 22. Rxa4 Nc5 {Anish didn't
ike the solid control that Black had on the dark squares.} 23. Rb4 Nxe4 24.
Rxe4 b5 $44 {Black is a pawn down but has excellent compensation.}) 21... Nc5
(21... f5 22. Rxa4 $16) 22. Rb4 $16 {[%cal Gf1b1]}) (20. Rxa4 Bxe4 21. Bxe4 b5

22. dxe5 Nxe5 23. Bf4 Bd7 $1 {[#] A strong regrouping of pieces by Svidler. The
bishop will be well placed on c6.} 24. Rd1 Bc6 $11 {Black has absolutely no
problems now.} 25. Rbd4 Re6 26. Ng5 Ree8 27. Ne4 Re6 28. Ng5 Ree8 29. Ne4 Re6
