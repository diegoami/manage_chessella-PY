Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Be6 {Black has managed to complete his development, while White
has a hold on the d5 square. the position is round about even.} 12. f4 exf4 13.

Black has no problems.}) 14... Qxe7 15. c3 Nc6 (15... Bxc4 16. dxc4 {The d6
pawn is hanging.}) 16. Bb5 $5 {Harikrishna maintains his bishop pair.} Rad8 17.
d4 cxd4 18. cxd4 d5 19. e5 Rc8 {This position is round about even because
White's dark squared bishop is not so effective at the moment. Also the knight
on c6 constantly puts pressure on the d4 pawn and Black is planning to strike
in the centre with f6.} 20. Be3 f6 $1 21. exf6 Rxf6 22. Qd2 Rcf8 23. Rxf6 Qxf6

Ng6 33. Qxf7+ Kxf7 {We reach an endgame where White doesn't really have any
realistic chances to win. But look how Hari keeps playing without any worry
about the result.} 34. b5 axb5 35. Bxb5 Ne7 36. g4 Be4 37. a4 Ke6 38. Bf4 Nc6
$6 {This may not be the losing move, but it gives White unneccessary chances.
However, Harikrishna's next move is not so easy to spot, because mentally we
feel that opposite coloured bishop endgames with equal material should be
drawn.} (38... g5 39. Be5 Bg6 {followed by h5 should give Black equal chances.}

been afraid that his kingside pawns would be fixed after h5.} c5 $1 {This is
the need of the position.} 44. dxc5 Kc6 45. Kd4 Bc8 {Black has managed to
create counterplay.} 46. g5 hxg5 47. hxg5 g6 {This position should be a draw.})
