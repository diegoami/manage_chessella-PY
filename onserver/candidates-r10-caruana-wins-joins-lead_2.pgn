1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 c6 4. Nc3 e6 5. e3 {If you are playing the Meran
against Anish you should have a really good idea up your sleeve or else it will
just be a draw!} Nbd7 6. Qc2 Bd6 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O dxc4 9. Bxc4 b5 10. Bd3 Bb7
11. a3 Rc8 12. b4 (12. Ng5 c5 $5 {was the famous Aronian-Anand Wijk Aan Zee
2013 game.}) 12... a5 (12... c5 {is also a possible move, but we won't delve
into the details right now.}) 13. Qb3 $146 {The first new move of the game, but
it doesn't change the nature of the position.} (13. Rb1 {is the more common
move.}) 13... e5 $1 {Good reaction by Anish, who knows the details of this
opening quite well.} 14. Ne4 Nxe4 15. Bxe4 g6 (15... exd4 {was also possible.}

Bxh2+ {wins a pawn but is positionally flawed.} 19. Kxh2 Qh4+ 20. Kg1 Qxe4 21.
Qc3 $1 f6 22. bxa5 $14 {White is better, not only because he won back the pawn
on a5 but because his bishop is clearly superior to the one on b7, and in
opposite coloured bishop positions that is what matters.}) 19. Qc2 Bxb2 20.
Qxb2 Qe7 $1 {Look how accurately Anish solves the problem of his b7 bishop. }
21. Qc2 (21. Bd3 c5 22. Bxb5 Bxg2 $1 $15 {[%cal Ge7b7]}) 21... Rfe8 $1 {
Forcing the bishop to move and then going c5 so that the rook on e8 will be
ready to swing to e5.} 22. Bf3 c5 23. Bxb7 Qxb7 24. bxc5 Re5 25. Rfc1 Qc6 (

Rxc5 $11 29. Kf1 h5 30. Ke2 Rc2+ 31. Kf3 Rc5 {A technically clean game by Anish
and nothing special shown by Karjakin. Maybe he was just happy with a draw.}
