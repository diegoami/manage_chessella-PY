{After a roller-coaster journey, I landed in the following position: White to
play. How would you assess it? Is it better, worse or equal for White?} 29.
Rfe1 {is what I played but it was not correct.} (29. Rc2 {Is the precise way,
literally forcing Black to take one exchange back.} Bd3 30. Rfc1 $16 {since the
c3-pawn is sort of hanging, Black must make a decision between the devil and
the deep blue sea: which bishop should he give away? It doesn't matter, as
White should be winning anyway.}) 29... Bxe2 {played without thought, which is
not surprising giving the clock times.} ({However,} 29... Bd3 $1 30. Re3 c4 31.
Rc1 c2 $13 {would have given Black just as many hopes as White could have. The
resulting position is rather complicated, with a very unusual material
imbalance. Personally, I would take Black since White's rooks are lacking
freedom of speech.}) 30. Rxe2 Bg5 31. Kf1 Bd2 32. Re8+ Kh7 33. Ke2 {and White's
win becomes a matter of mathematics.} Bg5 34. Kd1 Kg6 35. Ra8 Bf6 36. Rxa7 Bd4
