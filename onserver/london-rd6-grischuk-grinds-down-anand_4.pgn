28. Qd2 Ng6 29. Rb2 Qd7 30. Ne2 Ra4 31. Rbc2 R8a6 32. Nd4 {White already has
the much pleasant position here. He is attacking the c6 pawn and Black doesn't
have many ways to defend it.} Ne7 $2 {Adams forgot about the move Nb3 which
sets up a deadly threat of Nc5 fork which cannot be stopped.} (32... Rc4 { was
relatively best, giving up a pawn but retaining decent chances.} 33. Rxc4 dxc4
34. Rxc4 c5 35. Rxc5 Ra4 36. Nb3 Qxd2 37. Nxd2 Nxf4 $16 {It will be a touch and
go between White winning this one and a draw.}) 33. Nb3 $1 Qf5 34. Nc5 Ra8 35.
Nxa4 Rxa4 {White can win in a variety of ways from here, and that could well be
the reason why Topalov went wrong after a few moves. Maybe he thought he can
play in the ways he likes.} 36. g3 (36. g4 $5 Qxf4+ 37. Qxf4 Rxf4 38. Kg3 g5
39. Ra2 $18 {would have lead to a winning position for White.}) 36... g5 37.
fxg5 hxg5 38. Re1 $6 Ng6 39. e6 $6 {At this point Topalov thought that he could
play just about anything and win. However that is not the case as we shall see
in the game.} fxe6 40. Rxc6 Ne5 41. Rc8+ Kf7 42. Rf1 Nxf3+ 43. Rxf3 Qxf3 44.
Qc2 {It looks extremely dangerous for Black, but surprisingly he can defend the
position with the only move here.} Kg7 $1 45. Qxa4 (45. Rc7+ Kf6 $11) 45...
