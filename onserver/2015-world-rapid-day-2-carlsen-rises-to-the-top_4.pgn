h3  b5  19. d5  exd5  20. e5 {(1s) During the game, Jan Gustafsson, the
official commentator, quipped that this sacrifice was reminiscent of a famous
game between Polugaevsky-Tal that had inspired thousands of poor patzers to
blunder away their d-pawns in the hopes it was equally brilliant.} Re8  21. Qh5

Ba4  Rf8  28. Bb3  Qc5  29. Nh4  Qc3 {(55s) White has been struggling with a
worse position against the former World Champion for most of the game, and now
the black queen is attacking both the pawn on e5 and the rook on e1. Is it game
over?} 30. Rexe4 $1 {(32s) Not quite! This is not a sacrifice of desperation
but a bona fide brilliancy that saves the game.} dxe4  31. Rxf7 $1  Rxf7  32.
Bxe6  Qc1+  33. Kh2  Qf4+  34. Kh1  Bc8 $1 { (110s) All this had to have come
as a bit of a shock to Kramnik, but he responds well, and makes sure that
White, with only seconds left, shows he has really all the answers.} 35. Bb3 
({The point is simply that after} 35. Bxc8 Qc1+ 36. Kh2 Qxc8 {Black is
winning.}) 35... Qxf2  36. Ng6  Kh7  37. Nh4 {(7s) The rook on f7 is attacked
twice, so Black must respond.} Qf1+  38. Kh2  Qf4+  39. Kh1  Rf8 {(81s) Show
me! Black asks White once more.} 40. Qg6+  Kh8  41. Qd6 {(4s) In spite of being
down to literaly seconds, Kovalenko finds all the right moves. This is the only
saving move once again. Everything else loses for White.} Qf1+  42. Kh2  Qf4+ 
43. Kh1  Qf1+  44. Kh2  Qf4+ {(7s) Kramnik smiled, obviously in respect and
admiration for the superb last-minute save, and extended his hand. Draw!}
