Nxd5 9. Nbd2 Kh8 10. Re1 f6 11. d4 Ba7 (11... exd4 12. Nb3 Ba7 13. Nbxd4 Nxd4
14. Nxd4 {was on the better side for White in Giri-Tomashevsky of September
last year. White's pressure stems from the space advantage on the queenside and
the weakness on e6. It isn't very serious, and probably black can hold with
precise play, but it's much more comfortable to play white.}) 12. dxe5 Nxe5 13.
Nxe5 fxe5 14. Nf3 (14. Ne4 {seems natural, but it releases the pressure on e5.
Nf3 is a bit more ambitious but it clearly has a couple of problems, mainly the
weakness on f2.}) 14... c6 (14... Bxf2+ {was already possible, but not entirely
clear} 15. Kxf2 Qh4+ 16. Kg1 Qxc4 17. Rxe5 {and after a forced sequence White's
position is still slightly more comfortable. His pieces are a bit more active,
even though again, black should be ok.}) 15. Bg5 {Choices aren't easy in chess,
and Kramnik presents his opponent with three distinct ones:} (15. Bxd5 $5 cxd5
16. Rxe5 Bg4 {looks a bit dodgy. White will retain extra material (at least one
pawn, more if he wants) but his structure on the kingside will be shattered and
his king permanently exposed. These kinds of positions sometimes boil down to
style, and Kramnik here prefers the initiative.}) 15... Qb6 $6 {Not the most
precise. Kramnik ditches the f2 pawn for piece activity and central control}
(15... Bxf2+ 16. Kxf2 (16. Kh1 Qd6 17. Re2 Be6 $1 18. Rxf2 e4 {is also wildly
unclear}) 16... Qxg5 17. Kg1 Qd8 18. Nxe5 $14 {seems to be a bit better for
White}) (15... Qd6 $5 {Keeping the defense on the e5 pawn, now for example:}
16. Bh4 $5 (16. Re4 Qg6 $1 17. Bxd5 cxd5 18. Rxe5 Bg4 19. Kh1 $1 {with a huge
mess}) 16... Bg4 17. Bg3 Bxf3 18. gxf3 Rf5 $13) 16. Bxd5 cxd5 (16... Qxf2+ 17.
Kh1 cxd5 18. Qxd5 {with e5 falling next, White's king is much safer than
Black's.}) 17. Be3 $1 Qxb2 18. Bxa7 Rxa7 19. Qxd5 {Kramnik is a cunning
trickster} b6 (19... Qxc3 $2 20. Qd6 $1 Rg8 21. Qb8 {and the rook cannot be
saved!}) 20. Rab1 $6 (20. Qc4 {the pawn deserved to live. This move also
threatens Ra2, winning on the spot} e4 $1 21. Ra2 Rc7 22. Qxc7 Qxa2 23. Rxe4
$16) 20... Qxc3 21. Rxb6 Raf7 22. Qxe5 Qxe5 23. Rxe5 {White is up a pawn in the
resulting endgame, but because of the pressure on f2, the superiority of a
bishop over a knight, and the reduced amount of pawns, winning is tough.} Bg4
24. Re3 Kg8 25. Ne5 (25. Rxa6 Bxf3 26. Rxf3 Rxf3 27. gxf3 Rxf3 {is a draw as
the rook gets in behind the pawn}) 25... Rxf2 26. h3 Bc8 27. Nc6 Rf1+ 28. Kh2
R1f6 29. a5 h6 30. Ne7+ Kf7 31. Nc6 Kg8 32. Rc3 { White retains some pressure,
but now Black can neutralize it and Karjakin has no problems doing so.} Kh7 33.
