{This January 1939 study is more of a logical problem, but not in the sense of
the "Neudeutsche Schule" ("New German School"). White is to move and win,
which is done by checkmating Black. The "Saavedra checkmate" is achieved by
cycling through Kc7-b6-c7 multiple times in some problems, but here we see
this trick only once at the end. It received the 2nd prize, which suggests
that the judge enjoyed it greatly. In its time this might have been rather
novel, but nowadays such ideas have been seen many many times.} 1. f7 (1. Rg5

{The final study shows a battle for promotion. It is not very difficult, but
has an echo variation and a third one where the black bishop is cut off.} {
Black wants to use the route a4-c2-g6 or a4-d1-h5, so White cuts this off,
forcing the bishop to use the "bad" diagonal a4-e8 where Pb5 obstructs the way.
White can secure his win by being close enough with his king to cause trouble.
