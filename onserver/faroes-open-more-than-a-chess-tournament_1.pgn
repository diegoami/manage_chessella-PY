1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 {An inspired choice of opening, or in my
case - an opening choice when you don't know what else to do.} Nf6 5. Ne5 g6 6.
Bb5+ Bd7 ({I genuinely wondered, why not} 6... Nbd7 {why give up the bishop?}
7. O-O Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. Nc3 Nb8 $11 {Carlsen,M (2733)-Morozevich,A (2765)

(10. Re1 a6 11. Bf1 {makes ...e5 much harder, and was probably better.}) 10...
a6 11. Bd3 e5 $1 {Now Black gets a lot of activity in exchange for his isolated
pawn.} 12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nf3 Nc4 {The c1 bishop is tied down. White can't play
b3 because that would make c3 intensely weak and provide Black an easy target.
So how to improve White's position? I couldn't see a way, so I decided to just
sit still, wait and put the brunt of doing something on my opponent.} 14. a4
Re8 15. Qc2 Qc7 16. Rd1 Ne4 17. Bf1 Rad8 18. g3 {Black's pieces are optimally
placed while White is just waiting around. Now the problem for Black is how to
improve his position further. The position is probably around equal as White
doesn't really have any major weakness.} b5 19. axb5 axb5 20. Ng5 (20. Nd2
{fails to} Nxf2) 20... Nxb2 $2 ({I don't see how White can do much better than
a draw after} 20... Nf6 21. Nf3 {is always an option,} (21. Nh3 {was a riskier
idea, with the aim to try and put pressure on d5. However, Black's piece
activity easily negates this.} Ne4 {if} 22. Nf4 { then} d4)) 21. Qxb2 Nxc3
(21... Bxc3 22. Qc2 Nxf2 23. Qxf2 Bxa1 {is three pawns and rook for two minor
pieces, but Black already loses one pawn back after} 24. Bxb5 {and more after}
Re7 (24... Rf8 25. Ba3 $16) 25. Ba3 $16) 22. Bf4 Qb6 23. Qb3 {This was the move
my opponent had missed.} h6 (23... Nxd1 24. Rxd1 Bd4 $5 (24... h6 25. Nf3 b4
{White can't take on d5 yet here, however, he doesn't have to. The two passed
pawns, are weaknesses and liabilities and are bound to fall.} 26. Bd2 $16) 25.
Nh3 b4 {was probably Black's best try}) 24. Nf3 g5 25. Bd2 Ne4 {An unexpected
move.} (25... Nxd1 26. Rxd1 {is probably easier for White, although I wasn't
quite sure if I could've converted the two bishops vs rook 3 vs 3 on the same
side. I was reminded of Carlsen-Karjakin, 2nd rapid game, but I decided to
cross that bridge when it came, and in any case White has a pleasant position
with only two results possible.}) 26. Be3 d4 27. Nxd4 {seemed the simplest
possibility with limited time.} (27. Bd2 Qf6 28. Bxb5 Rb8 {is maybe objectively
stronger, but would enable my opponent to achieve his objective of setting me
problems to solve within limited time.}) 27... Rxd4 (27... Bxd4 28. Rxd4 Rxd4

33. Qxb4 Qxb4 34. Bxb4 {has similarities with Carlsen-Karjakin.}) 28. Bxd4 Bxd4
29. Qxb5 Re6 30. Qxb6 Bxb6 31. Kg2 Nxf2 {I was quite happy to get into this
stage. The position is not winning and Black has good chances to hold, but
again, with limited time and intense pressure, it's only a matter of time till
the breaking point. The first objective was to get to 40 moves.} 32. Re1 Rxe1
33. Rxe1 Ng4 34. Re8+ Kg7 { White has to go after f7, but Black is on time to
defend this.} 35. Be2 (35. Bd3 {would stop the Black knight from going to d6,
but will allow him a nice grazing spot on e5.} Bc7 36. Re7 Bd6 37. Rd7 Bb4)
35... Ne3+ 36. Kf3 Nf5 37. Bd3 Nd6 38. Re1 h5 39. h4 $5 {Forcing Black to make
a committal choice before the time control.} gxh4 $5 (39... g4+ 40. Kg2 (40.

thought it was winning, but it turns out that Black has a brilliant defence in}

Rh5 $2 (50. Rh6+ $142) 50... Ng6 $2 (50... Kg6 $142 {would've been a simple
draw.} 51. Kh3 Ne6 52. Kg3 Bd6+ 53. Kf2 Bc5+ 54. Kg3 Bd6+ $11) 51. Rh7 Nf8 52.
Rh6+ Kg7 53. Ra6 Bxh4 54. Bd3 {I had this material combination for the first
ever time in my life, with rook and bishop vs bishop and knight with opposite
colour bishop. From afar, I thought this would be a draw, albeit not that
straightforward. However, later when I checked on tablebase, the position
actually turns out to be mate in 60 moves....} Ng6 55. Bxf5 Ne5 56. Kh3 Bg5 {In
a practical game, with 30 seconds each, this is like a fight between a steel
sword against a wooden sword. I doubt even Syrio Forel can do much here.} 57.
