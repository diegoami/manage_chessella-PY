{Pert vs Pert  Nick Pert and his twin brother Richard have long been familiar
fixtures on the british chess scene, and for many years Richard has to some
extent lived in the shadow of his brother, but is a serious player in his own
right.  Indeed I think without having to try and juggle a family with a full
time job I'm fairly sure Richard would have nailed down the gm title long ago,
and when he does play he tends to be able to compete with professional players
on an equal basis. In the game against his brother, he was able to show how
dangerous he can be in opening preparation.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4.
