38. Nf1 {I don't think blitz games should be overanalysed but to have a look
at a few interesting positions is always fun. Here we see the top see in big
trouble. d6 is about to fall and realizing just that, Black decided to sac a
piece.} Bxg4 39. Qxd6 ({And Black gets rewarded!} 39. fxg4 Nxe4 40. Qa4 $1 Nxd2
41. Qc2+ {would have forced Bassem's resignation... but that is blitz!}) 39...
Nc8 (39... Bh3+ 40. Kf2 Bxf1 {wins material, but seconds were ticking away...})
40. Qxc5 Bh3+ 41. Kg1 Bxf1 42. Bxg5 Qg2# {Mate! The Algerian GM had a shaky
first part of the Blitz section but, faster than a tumbler toy, he readjusted
his position in the standings after a raging 5/5 in the final rounds. A second
place for Mohamed in the combined standings and a prize of US$ 4,000.} 0-1

{Getting ten of the strongest players in Africa to face each other will
inevitably lead to some of them having a less desirable result. It was the
case of Arthur but the scores are rarely presenting the full story, as he did
have a couple of very well conducted games. But the clock is mercilessly
ticking...} 19. Nxf7 $1 Kxf7 20. Qf3+ Nf6 21. exf6 gxf6 22. Bxb8 {the
beginning of the down trend.} ({Instead} 22. Re3 {would have been preferable}
Rce8 (22... Bxg3 {runs straight into} 23. fxg3 $18 {and the black king os too
exposed.}) 23. Rfe1 Bxg3 24. Qxg3 Rhg8 25. Qf3 Rh8 26. Bxg6+ Kxg6 27. Ne2 e5
28. Qxd5 $18 {It is obviously not a forced line but a sample of how could have
White kept the pressure and the massive initiative.}) 22... Rxb8 23. Qe3 Rbg8
24. Nf3 {exchanging queens solved all Black's problems.} ({As much as I like} 
24. f4 {suggested by computers, that is not an easy human decision to make.}
Nxh4 25. Rf2 $44) 24... Qxe3 25. fxe3 Ke7 {the remainder of the game presents
no more interest for the purpose of this particular excerpt. Black turned the
tables and won the resulting endgame.} 0-1

{The revelation of the Blitz portion was without a shadow of doubt the young
Angolan IM, David Silva. He finished right behind Bassem, which brought him to
a 4th place in the combined standings. In this example though, he felt the
danger blowing in his neck.} 21... Qd8 {A natural defensive move, especially
for a Blitz encounter, but objectively not the strongest response.} ({Weirdly
enough, the 'unnatural'} 21... O-O {running straight into White's attack after}

beautiful} g5 $1 $19) 22. bxa4 Qxg5+ 23. hxg5 Bxa2 {the beginning of the end.}
