{Levon Aronian has always been
a tough opponent for Vishy Anand. The Armenian has had a good score against
the Indian, but quite often Anand has been able to create certain brilliancies
against Levon, for instanc their game at the Wijk Aan Zee 2013.} 1. d4
Nf6 2. c4 e6 {Anand starts off with the flexible moves Nf6 and e6. This
gives him a lot of options â€“ to play the Nimzo, QGD, Ragozin and also
the Benoni if the need arises.} 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Nbd7 $5 { This idea of
developing the knight on d7 before the bishop on f8 is interesting. The
point of this move is that the bishop can develop on e7 or b4. This keeps
all options open. And as Vishy mentioned after the game: Nbd7 is
transpositional
in nature and gives Black many more opportunities.} 5. Bf4 { After suffering
for the entire game yesterday from the black side of the QGD 5. Bf4, Aronian
thinks that this is a good idea to try it as White!} dxc4 $5 (5... Be7
6. e3 O-O $1 {takes us to the main line of the 5.Bf4 QGD.}) 6. e3 {This
is quite an important position and the main moves here have been ...Nb6
and ... Nd5. Even a6 has been popular. But Anand opts for the move 6...
b5!? which has only been played 19 times before.} b5 {So what is the idea
of this move, you may ask. Well first of all you are simply saving the
pawn on c4. Hence, the logical move is to take on b5. But after} 7. Nxb5
{Black gets to develop with a tempo with the move:} Bb4+ 8. Nd2 $5 {This
move has only been played once before in this particular position and
only a week ago by Boris Gelfand in his game against Boris Grachev from
the Aeroflot Open 2016. The height of coincidence is that when this move
was made, Gelfand was sitting right besides me. He told me that this was
played by him against Grachev in the Aeroflot Open 2016. I asked him whether
he thinks Aronian knew the game and followed his idea. Gelfand said: "Aeroflot
is a great tournament, and I am one of the top players. So it wouldn't
come as a surprise if Aronian had not missed this game!"} (8. Nc3 {is
the only move that has been played before by top players like Wojtaszek,
Karjakin, Roiz, Gustaffson and Bu. Play might continue something like
this:} Nd5 9. Rc1 N7b6 {with a complex position.}) 8... Nd5 { Vishy Anand
paused for a while before making this move. Most probably recalling his
analysis.} 9. Bg3 N7b6 10. Qc2 O-O 11. Be2 (11. Bxc4 Nxc4 12. Qxc4 Ba6
$19 {wouldn't be very good for White.}) 11... Ba6 12. Nc3 c5 $1 { Black
is ahead in development and hence makes the right decision to open up
the position.} 13. dxc5 {Until now we have been following the game between
Gelfand-Grachev and through transposition we also have the game of Lenic
vs Stern. At this point, however, Anand deviates and instead of directly
taking on c5, he first takes on c3 and then picks up the c5 pawn.} Nxc3
14. bxc3 Bxc5 15. O-O {Both sides have castled and the opening phase is
now over. Let us try to understand what's going on. The pawn on c4 gives
Black space but it also limits Black's possibilities, as two of his pieces
are tied down. It may look like White is slightly better, but Black is
holding the balance.} Rc8 16. Rfd1 Qg5 (16... Qf6 {is also possible as}
17. Ne4 {is met with} Qf5 18. Rac1 Be7 { with an interesting position.})
17. Nf3 Qg6 18. Qd2 Bb5 $1 {This is the key move of the entire game. It
is a common idea in this structure: Black reroutes his bishop to a4 where
it will be much more useful than on a6.} 19. Qe1 { Aronian made this move
quite quickly, which felt as thought he was still in his home-preparation.
But as he mentioned after the game, he seemed to have a deja vu feeling
that he had seen this before at home, when actually it was quite possible
that he hadn't. In any case this is pretty good move with the idea of
meeting Ba4 with Rd2.} Ba4 20. Ne5 (20. Rd2 $6 f6 $1 {Was the important
point. Hence it is neccessary to insert Ne5 before playing Rd2.}) 20...
Qg5 21. Rd2 (21. Nf3 {trying to repeat the position would be incorrect
as after} Qe7 22. Rd2 f6 {with the idea of e5, Black is clearly better.})
21... Rfd8 22. Rxd8+ Qxd8 (22... Rxd8 {was also possible.} 23. Nxc4 Nxc4
24. Bxc4 $14 {Black has compensation but he will not be regaining his
pawn any time soon.}) 23. Nxc4 Nxc4 24. Bxc4 Bxe3 $1 {The most clear cut
way to equalize.} (24... Ba3 {is also possible but after} 25. Bb3 Bxb3
26. axb3 Bb2 27. Rxa7 $14 {White has a small edge.}) 25. Qxe3 (25. Ba6
Bd2 26. Qe4 Bc6 $1 {An important move to foresee.} 27. Qe5 Ra8 28. Rd1
Qb6 $11) 25... Rxc4 26. Rb1 Rc8 27. h3 (27. Qxa7 Bc2 28. Rc1 Rxc3 $11)
27... a6 28. c4 Rxc4 29. Rb8 Rc8 30. Qb6 Rxb8 31. Qxb8 { And rather than
trying to play this pawn up endgame which would anyway end in a draw after
30 odd more moves, due to the opposite coloured bishops, Anand agreed
to a draw. A wise decision considering that there is such a long event
left ahead.} 1/2-1/2
