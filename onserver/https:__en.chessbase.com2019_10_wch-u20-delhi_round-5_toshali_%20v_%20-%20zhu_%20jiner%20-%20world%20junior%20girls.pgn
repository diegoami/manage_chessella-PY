{Excellent result for India! The young and talented Toshali beat the top seed
of the tournament. Actually it is not uncommon to see an Indian defeating
strong players across the world. Every day Indian players are getting stronger
and new stars are emerging.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bg5 Bg7 4. Nbd2 O-O 5. c3

good to put the rival out of the book. One of the main continuations is:} (7.

there is nothing concrete for white pieces to hunt it, thanks to the nearby f6
that will be very useful for the black position} 8... Ng4 9. Bf4 Nd7 10. Qe2 f6

her side, black has a reasonable position to play.}) 9. e6 {The idea of
sacrifice the pawn for damaging the black structure has concluded. A very
original idea! Now Zhu has to defend this position with black pieces, which
can be quite tough psychologically against a player over 600 points below you.}

to surrender because there is no salvation for his position, the knight is
locked up, now it will be a missing piece, bad bishop, and weak structure.} 1-0
