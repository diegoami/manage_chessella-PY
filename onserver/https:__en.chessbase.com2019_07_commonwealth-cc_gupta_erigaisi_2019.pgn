The analysis of this game is based on Abhijeet's interview to ChessBase India
after the game. The interview gives better insights to the game than engine
analysis because the engine somehow feels almost throughout the opening phase
of the game that Black is completely winning, but in a practical game that is
not the case.} 1. d4 {[%emt 0:00:00]} d5 {[%emt 0:00:00]} 2. c4 {[%emt 0:00:00]

[%emt 0:02:48] This is the fourth most popular move in the position after h4,
0-0 and Qc2. Abhijeet hoped that he would be able to surprise Arjun to some
extent with this move. Still it is not a completely new move. You have nearly
300 games with it in the database.} Nd5 {[%emt 0:00:15]} 11. Nd2 {[%emt 0:00:

{Such positions are shown completely winning by the engine, but in an over the
board play, it is not the easiest to defend as lines are opening up around the
black king and he has to be careful. Still, in a position like this the bishop
on g3 is quite passive and so Black should be clearly better.}) 16. Bxd5 {
