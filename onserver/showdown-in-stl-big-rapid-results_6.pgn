a6 9. Bd3 $5 {Not the most common, but it does look logical to develop a bishop
doesn't it?} b5 10. O-O Qb6 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. Bxc5 Nxc5 13. Qf2 Nd7 14. a3 Ke7
15. Qxb6 Nxb6 16. Ne2 Bd7 17. b3 {White has a slight edge in these structures
usually, but Black has his chances with breaks on f6 if he can get them in.} f6

advantage. Those pawns are rolling on the queenside.}) 31... Nxe5 32. Kb6 Be8
33. a4 Kd6 {With White's king so separated from his rook it does look like
Black can hold. However a pawn is a pawn, and he still has chances.} 34. Rf2

the moment.} Be4 {based on a miscalculation} 45. Re3+ Kf1 46. Rxe4 d2 47. Nf5
{stopping everything, now the game is simply over.} Rc3 48. Rd4 Ke1 49. a5 g6
50. Nd6 {Black can get the rook if he wants, it does not matter. The pawns are
too powerful.} 1-0
