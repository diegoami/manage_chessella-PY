sharp Moscow System?} 6. Bxf6 {Not today! Aronian opts for the safer system.}

in only one game until now. Which game is that? Read on to find out!}
Qe7 11. Ne5 Qb4+ 12. Qxb4 Bxb4+ 13. Ke2 Be7 {Now here's the fun fact.
This same line was played by Levon and Anish against each other at the
Zurich Rapid 2016!} 14. f3 $146 {[%cal Gf2f3] The first new move of the
game. In the previous encounter Levon had played f4. Now he tries to improve
with f3.} (14. f4 $6 {The main reason why f4 is not such a great move
is because of} b6 $1 15. Kf2 (15. Nxc6 Bb7 16. Nxe7 Bxe4 $19 {The knight

Rg8 {In order to play f5 at some point.} 15. Rc1 { All of Levon's ideas
have been made with the sole purpose of preventing the move b6. If he
can prevent Black from playing that he can harbour ambitions of an advantage
because the c8 bishop is passive.} f5 16. Nxd7 (16. Nd2 Nxe5 17. dxe5

to continue the game and accepted the draw.} 1/2-1/2
