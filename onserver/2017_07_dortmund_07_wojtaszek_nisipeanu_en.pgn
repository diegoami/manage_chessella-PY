Nd4 Nxd4 15. Bxd4 c5 16. Bc3 a4 {[#] Wojtaszek has the pair of bishops,
but the e4 pawn prevents it from exerting its full force. White has the
option to exchange rooks along the d-file but that was probably to
benign for the Polish GM, who instead opts to take some risk in exchange
for winning chances} 17. f4 $5 Bd7 (17... exf3 {was quite playable:} 18.
Bxf3 (18. Rxf3 Ne4 19. Bd3 Re8 {This would have allowed Black to keep
blocking the light-squared bishop e4 - now with the knight.}) 18...
Qxe3+ 19. Kh1 Qg5 {Was playable for Black, but Nisipeanu certainly
wanted to avoid exactly this sort of line where White achieves maximum
piece activity.}) 18. f5 Bc6 19. Rf4 Rd6 20. Raf1 Rad8 21. Qc1 Nd7 {[#]
This is what White wants...} 22. f6 $1 {... which Wojtaszek plays with
pleasure.} Nxf6 (22... Rxf6 $1 23. Bxf6 Nxf6 24. Qe1 b6 {was
surprisingly much better for Black: At the expense of an exchange (for a
pawn) the dangerous c3 bishop disappears from the board. Black simply
has a good, active position, while from the White's attack is nothing
special.}) 23. Qe1 Ne8 (23... Re6 24. Qg3 Qc7 25. Qg5 h6 26. Qxc5 $16
{this looks to be the best option for Black.}) 24. Rxf7 Qxf7 25. Rxf7
Kxf7 26. Qg3 Nf6 27. Qe5 {[#] Now black is nothing better, than to give
up an exchange voluntarily - the unappealing alternative would be to
remain entirely passive. White would have advanced his g-pawn And
thus brought his e2-bishop into play. With the material advantage, Wojtaszek is
now sure to bring the win home.} Rd2 28. Bxd2 Rxd2 29. Kf1 Rc2 30. Ke1 Rc1+ 31.
