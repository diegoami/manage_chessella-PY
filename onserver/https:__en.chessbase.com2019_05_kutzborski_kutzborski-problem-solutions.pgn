{[#] This is a masterwork on the so called Wurzburg-Plachutta interference
theme. The key,} 1. Ne3 {(a Plachutta sacrifice) demonstrates the theme.
Notice how capturing the knight en prise on e3 creates fatal mutual
interferences: Therefore} e4 {is the optimal continuation for Black, giving
some room to the king. The mainline continues with} (1... Rhxe3 2. Ne4+ Rxe4 3.
Ba3#) (1... Rexe3 2. Ba3+ Rxa3 3. Ne4#) ({and of course,} 1... dxe3 {runs into}
2. Ba3#) (1... Nxe3 2. Ba3#) 2. f4 $1 exf3 3. Ng4 {threat 4.Ba3#} f2 4. Bc1 $1
{threat 5.Bf4#} e5 5. Ne3 {a second plachutta} e4 6. Ng4 {and now there is no
defense against a simple a mate-in-two. Why?} Qg7 (6... Rf3 7. Bd2 $1 {
threatens Bb4# and Black can't defend both f4 & b4}) (6... Rhe3 7. Nxe4+ Rxe4
8. Ba3#) (6... Ree3 7. Ba3+ Rxa3 8. Nxe4#) ({and of course} 6... Ne3 {is lame,
simply runs into} 7. Ba3#) 7. Bf4+ Qe5 8. Nxf7# {Watch how the wNg4 performs
stunning switchbacks (g4 to e3) twice, this is many layers of concealed logic
unfurling through exciting play - a typical Kutzborski masterpiece!} *

{[#] It requires imagination to solve a Kutzborski problem as this brilliant
example illustrates. Imagine if there was no black pawn on g7 then White could
have immediately registered mate with 1.Re4+ Kf8 2.Bh6#, but with the bPg7
what does White do? Well, he prepares to realize just that!} {First,} 1. Rb4 {
threatening 2.Rb8#, the idea is to push the bRa7 to the last rank. The
main-line now continues with} Ra8 2. Re4+ Kf8 3. Rf4+ Ke8 4. Bf7+ Kf8 5. Bb3+
Ke8 6. Bd1 {threat: 7.Bh5+} g6 {and White successfully removes the bPg7} 7. Bb3
{threat 8.Re4+ Kf8 9.Bh6#} d5 8. Ba4+ c6 9. Bxc6# {and it is with this last
move that the point behind 1.Rb4! becomes clear, the idea was to deprive the
7th rank of the black rook's defense. This kind of work in non-linear logic
isn't uncommon in Kutzborski's rich oeuvre.} *

{[#]} {This is another classy gem. One would like to try 1.Bb2? (threatening
Bc1#) or 1.e6? (threatening Be5#) but these are refuted by 1...Qa3! & 1...Qa1!
respectively. The trick lies in first driving the bQ out of the a-file and
only then Bb2 followed by Bc1# will be the coup de grace! First a few checks
to bring the white rook to a better square} 1. Be3+ Kg3 2. Bg1+ Kf4 3. Rf3+ Ke4
4. Rc3+ Kf4 5. Be3+ Kg3 6. Bd4+ Kf4 7. e6 {threatening Be5#} Qb8 {is the only
move as Qa1 is meaningless now; next, the white rook prepares again to return
to its initial square:} 8. Be3+ Kg3 9. Bg1+ Kf4 10. Rf3+ Ke4 11. Rb3+ Kf4 12.
Be3+ Kg3 13. Bd4+ Kf4 {and finally now} 14. Bb2 {works, there is no defense
against 15. B(x)c1#} *

{[#] Kutzborski is remembered to be a kind-hearted gentleman among his fellow
colleagues and kin. He co-authored "Logische Phantasien. Herbert Grasemann und
seine Schachaufgaben" with Wolfang Dittman and Armin Geister and composed
several problems in collaboration. This is one of his successful
co-productions with Hans Peter Rehm, another exemplary German composer of
modern times. When you work through the solution of this problem, do take
notice of the black pawn on c4 - it is the proverbial Achilles' heel in
Black's structure.} 1. Ne8 {Threatens 2.Nd6# and forces Bb4, an important
interference} Bb4 2. Nf6+ Kf5 3. Nh5 {Threat: 4.Ng3#} b2 4. Ng7+ Ke4 5. Be8 {
Threat: 6.Bd7#} Kd5 6. Kb7 c3 7. Bf7+ Ke4 8. Nh5 c2 {and finally} 9. Nf6+ Kf5
10. e4# {- a beautiful pawn-mate} *
