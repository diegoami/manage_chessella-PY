{Before the final round Kramnik, the second seed in this tournament (behind
Giri), was leading the field with 7.0/8, followed by me with 6.5/8. I felt a
bit exhausted after my lucky but deserved five hour victory in round eight
against Giri. Playing the former World Champion, whose games I had studied
extensively ever since I began playing chess, was of course a great event for
me. I approached the last round with excitement and was eager to learn from one
of the most renowned personalities in chess history.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.
Bb5 Nf6 {Not a big surprise - I was expecting either the Berlin or the
Petroff.} 4. d3 {I chose a line that avoids the exchange of too many pieces.
Kramnik is one of the leading experts of the Berlin, and he is particularly
strong in quiet endgames without queens. Thus, I was eager to get a more open
and combative type of position, which suits my strengths much more.} Bc5 5.
Bxc6 $5 {I was happy to exchange my bishop for his knight to create an
unbalanced position with a doubled pawns for Black. I know there are three
other main moves but with this one White avoids simplifications.} dxc6 6. Nbd2
Be6 {I had prepared mainly against 6...0-0.} 7. O-O Nd7 8. Nb3 Bb6 $5 {To my
knowledge 8...Be7 is played more frequently. I then wanted to continue with 9.
Na5 or 9.d4. I didn't spend much time analysing 8...Bb6 during my preparations
and now had to improvise.} (8... Be7 $5 9. d4 (9. Na5 $5)) 9. Ng5 Bxb3 10. axb3
f6 11. Nf3 Nf8 12. Nd2 {My intuition told me that White was slightly better
here.} Ne6 13. Qh5+ {The idea is to provoke ...g6. Later, after f4 from White,
the f6-square would be weak. As Black still has the doubled c-pawns, I felt the
closer we get to an endgame the more superior White's position would become.}
g6 14. Qd1 Bc5 15. Nc4 b5 $6 {Maybe not a good move. It weakens the queenside
and allows my knight to entrench itself on a5, effectively tying up Black's
c-pawns on c6 and c7.} (15... Qe7 16. Kh1 a6 17. f4 exf4 18. Bxf4 Nxf4 19. Rxf4

20. exf5 gxf5 21. Qc3 $1 {I had calculated for a very long time before deciding
to play this move. Black obviously wants to launch a kingside attack, so White
must quickly aim for counterplay on the queenside. As the saying goes, "attack
is the best defence"¬ù. Here my impression was that I was the one who spent time
calculating, while my opponent was relying more on his feeling. In hindsight I
have to say that I was luckier because this position really called for precise
calculations.} f4 ({I was expecting} 21... Bxa5 22. Rxa5 f4 (22... Qd5 23. f3
$16) {after which I intended to play} 23. Bxa7 {. I had calculated up to
25.Qg5+ leading to a draw, but then 26.Be3 secures a huge advantage for White.}

minutes I saw that after 24.Rxa7 Rxa7 25.Nxa7 Nd4, I could play 26.Nb5!. I
think my opponent must have missed this tactical resource.} ( 23... f3 24. Nxe5

avoiding any attempts to fork my queen after ...Nd4. White's advantage is
already very obvious.} Qe7 27. Nxb5 Kh8 $6 {I think Black should have played
27...fxg2 to attain a bit of counterplay.} (27... fxg2 28. Kxg2 (28. Qxg2+ Kh8

think White's advantage is decisive. After Ra1-a8 and an exchange of rooks
White is simply three pawns up.} Qf7 29. Ra1 Ng5 30. Ra8 Qe7 31. h4 Nh3+ 32.

win this important game and with it the tournament! But when euphoria and
happiness subsided, I felt terribly exhausted and was longing for a good rest!}
