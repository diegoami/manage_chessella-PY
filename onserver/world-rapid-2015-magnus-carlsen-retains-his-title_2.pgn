{Let's join this endgame at this point. Prior to this Ivanchuk was having a
small edge but he didn't play so well and now Carlsen is at least equal. That's
the thing with Magnus, once he sees the flow shifting he doesn't agree to a
draw but goes for the full point.} 40. c4 $5 {An ambitious decision which does
not change the evaluation of the position but gives Black some concrete
problems to solve.} dxc4 41. Ke4 Rf4+ (41... Re6 42. Rh3 Re7 43. c3 Re6 44. Rh6
{would lead to some sort of a zugzwang that looks pretty dangerous if you do
not have an engine evaluation to help you.}) 42. Kxe5 {The pawn exchanges begin
now and very soon we are left with very little material on the board.} Rxf3 43.
Rxg6 Kxh7 44. Rxc6 Rc3 (44... Rxa3 45. Rxc4 {is not very comfortable for
Black.}) 45. Kd5 Rxa3 46. Rxc4 Ra1 47. Kc5 Kg6 {Ivanchuk has played well and
the game is still very much equal.} 48. Kb4 Kf6 49. Re4 Ra2 50. c3 Rc2 51. Rc4
Ra2 52. Kb5 a3 53. Kb4 Ke5 54. Kb3 Ra1 55. Ra4 Rc1 56. Rxa3 Kf4 57. Ra4+ Kf3
{Black has lost a pawn but his king has been activated and the c4 pawn cannot
be pushed as the guy on g4 will fall.} 58. Rd4 Ke3 59. Kb4 Rf1 60. Kc5 Rf4 $6
{Now it is easier to play as White.} (60... Rc1 61. c4 Rh1 62. Rd5 Kf4 63. Rd4+
Ke3 64. Kd5 Rh8 65. Re4+ Kf3 {is a very curious position where White will lose
his g-pawn and it will be a draw.}) 61. Kd5 Kf3 (61... Rf8 { Retaining the
rooks would have given Black excellent drawing chances.}) 62. Rxf4+ $1 gxf4 63.
g5 Ke3 64. g6 f3 65. g7 f2 66. g8=Q f1=Q {This queen endgame is very difficult
to defend in a practical game especially with very little time on clock.} 67.
Qe6+ Kd2 68. c4 Kc3 69. Qe3+ Kb4 70. Qb6+ Kc3 71. Qd4+ Kb3 72. c5 Qf7+ 73. Kc6
Qe6+ 74. Kb7 Qe7+ 75. Kb6 Qe6+ 76. c6 {One might say this is a premature
resignation but the position is simply lost and Ivanchuk did not want to try
testing Carlsen's immaculate technique.} 1-0
