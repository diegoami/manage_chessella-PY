1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5.
Nc3 $5 {This move takes an immediate step off the Ruy Lopez main road. The
conventional wisdom is that the knight should go to d2, and then after 0-0,
Re1 and Nd2-f1, it is within reach of the kingside meadows. If such a move was
played by a beginner in the 90s, a stronger opponent would probably have
pointed out that it is a mistake (although it clearly is not). Still, Spassky
used to play this way and in the last decade, Dominguez Perez has kept it among
his big guns.} Bc5 {Black faces an important choice already here. Should b5 be
played or not? Should the bishop go to c5 or not? 5.Nc3 is obviously not a
slower move than the usual 5.0-0, so Black doesn't have time for extravagant
alternatives. When you start playing chess you clearly prefer c5 to e7, if you
are to plonk down the bishop somewhere, but then later you become aware that
the bishop could be vulnerable to c3/d4 and Nxe5/d4-tricks, so you turn a bit
more philosophical about which "the right square" is for the bishop, and might
even swing over to the e7-side. I sometimes get the feeling that really strong
GMs have had the pendulum swing back to where c5 is the "right square".} ({
The other main line goes} 5... b5 6. Bb3 Be7 (6... Bc5 {Ah, anyway! Clearly
the better move order if you prefer to avoid the exchange on c6.} 7. d3 h6 8.
Nd5 Rb8 (8... O-O) 9. c3 d6 10. O-O O-O {and we come to a position where White
has a wide choice. When Carlsen and Anand played each other in Sinquefield Cup
2017, with opposite colours, their game reached this position and continued:}

the kind of position White is striving for, Rapport,R (2715)-Kollars,D (2530)

position is hard to avoid for White in the 5.Nc3-line, so if you intend to
play it you should have a look at it. I'm not entirely clear about what went
on in the following game:} Bf6 13. O-O Re8 14. b4 Nb7 15. c4 Be6 16. Bb2 c5 17.

opening.} 6. O-O (6. Nd5 $5) 6... O-O 7. d3 {...a6 is not, generally speaking,
a move that Black would play in the four knights, since White would take on c6,
but it is not clear to me that Black has anything to be unhappy about here.}
Bxc3 8. bxc3 d6 9. Nd2 (9. Bg5 {is standard in this position, but then it is
usual for Black to play Bd7 in order to prepare for a6, so one might argue
that a6 actually is a slight gain for Black here.} Qe7 10. Re1 (10. Nd2 $5)

himself in a situation where a6 actually makes sense, in Adhiban,B (2680)

move order as (my compatriot) Nils usually knows what he is doing.}) 7. Bb3 O-O

order...} ({After} 8. d3 {we soon end up in a position that we looked at after
5...b5 6.Bb3 Bc5.}) 8... Nxe4 (8... h6 9. c3 $1 {and White's d-pawn doesn't
have to 'refuel' on d3.}) 9. d3 Nf6 10. Bg5 Be7 11. Nxe7+ Qxe7 12. Re1 $44 {

is very similar to one of the main lines of the Berlin Defence (of the Ruy
Lopez); the only difference is that the pawn is on a6. Usually strong GMs
have prefered to play h3, Qe2, or Nbd2, rather than Nc3, in this position, but
Magnus has played a blitz game earlier where he had exactly the same position 
(minus a6):} Qd6 {I presume Vishy was aiming to apply a similar set-up to the
one Jakovenko used to win against Motylev (see comment after 9.0-0).} (7... O-O

instead of a6).}) 8. h3 Be6 9. Be3 $1 {Like I mentioned before; Black's bishop
is on the "best square" and White's bishop has nowhere to go. It's simple
maths that White wants them exchanged. (Magnus thought about the move for more
than 10 minutes, so I guess my logic is somewhat over simplified...)} (9. O-O

Qd2 {This position seems like nothing special for White and if Black gets to
play Nd7 and c5, then White has nothing. So the next two moves seem like the
only ambitious alternative.} ({After} 11. O-O O-O-O {White regrets having
played h3 when Black launches the g-pawn.}) 11... Nd7 12. d4 $5 ({I don't see
a good way for White to change the pawn structure after} 12. O-O-O c5 {One can
try a plan with Nf3-somewhere, followed by f4, but it will only give Black a
good square for the knight on e5.}) 12... exd4 13. Nxd4 c5 {Slightly
surprising and the kind of move one regrets after losing. It could be taken as
a statement, that: "I will take the d5-square from your knight and then you
have nothing." (Although Anand most certainly would not put it like that.)} 14.

extra kingside pawn.} (16. Rxd2 {is not completely bonkers either, since} Ke7 (

extra kingside pawn doesn't mean as much.}) 17. Rhd1 Rhd8 18. f4 {, forces
Black to play a less than comfortable endgame.}) 16... Ne5 17. f4 $1 {Only by
unsettling this knight, before it becomes a permanent feature on e5, can Black
be challenged.} (17. b3 g5 $1 18. f3 Ke7 19. h4 h6 {is comfortable for Black.

looks promising for White, but I feel that it could be one of those positions
that habitual Berlin-defenders could have all figured out (no, no, that's the
position when the knight is on h4!). Still, Anand avoided something very
similar on the second next move...}) 21... b6 22. g4 Nh4 $1 {The advantage of
hanging out on h4, is that there are no pieces that can push it away. The
downside is, you know, knight on the rim...} (22... Nd4 23. Rhf1 {is similar
to the line above, which means that 21.g4 probably was stronger than 21.Ne4,
at least from Anand's point of view. Perhaps Magnus didn't bother to stop the
knight from going to h4.}) 23. Rhf1 {From now on, life will be hard for Black.}
