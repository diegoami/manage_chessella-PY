8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {What do you choose in an all important game that could decide
the outcome of not only the tournament but also the Grand Chess Tour? Of
course, the Berlin!} 9. Nc3 Ke8 10. h3 h5 11. Bf4 Be7 12. Rad1 Be6 13. Ng5 Rh6
14. g3 {Anand has already played this position thrice with the black pieces and
Giri has been in White's shoes once. But it is the first time the players are
playing with the opposite colours. (Apart from Giri hqving tried it in this
very tournament against MVL with black.)} Bxg5 (14... Bc4 {was played by Anish
against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in this tournament.}) 15. Bxg5 Rg6 16. h4 f6 17.
exf6 gxf6 18. Bf4 Nxh4 19. f3 Rd8 20. Kf2 Rxd1 21. Nxd1 Nf5 {All of these moves
and the next few are very well known and hence do not require much comments.
There is nothing new under the sun.} 22. Rh1 Bxa2 23. Rxh5 Be6 24. g4 Nd6 25.
Rh7 Nf7 26. Ne3 {The players have been following the game Carlsen-Anand from
the 2014 World Championship match! In that game Anand played Kd8. Anish now
comes up with an improvement, but it is still not a novelty.} b6 {This had been
played by Bogdan Belyakov albeit only in a blitz game.} (26... Rg8 27. Bxc7 Rh8
28. Rxh8+ Nxh8 29. f4 $1 $14 {[%cal Gf4f5] and with f5 coming up White has the
microscopic plus.}) 27. Ng2 $146 (27. Rh1 { was played by Motylev in that blitz
game.}) (27. b3 $5 {is an improvement suggested by Giri in the press
conference, but I would say it is one of those moves which doesn't really
change the character of the position.}) 27... Rg8 28. Bxc7 Rh8 29. Rxh8+ (29.
