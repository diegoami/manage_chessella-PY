has been made.} Rc8 17. Qb3 Ne5 (17... Ba8 $2 18. Ncb5 {heading for d6 or a7!})
18. Nxc6 {That will be two bishops thank you!} Nxc6 19. Rad1 {The American
gold medal winner makes it look easy!} d4 20. Nb5 Qe7 21. Nxd4 Nxd4 22. Rxd4 {
To take stock, a full pawn up with the two bishops but now Black gets to push
a little and cements his knight on the c3 square.} Ne4 23. Rd3 Nc3 24. Bg4 Rc7
25. Rd2 Rd8 26. Bc1 Rxd2 27. Bxd2 b5 28. Rc1 Rc4 {A good move knowing the only
way for White to make progress is to agree to go into the queen and
opposite-colored bishop ending.} 29. Bxc3 {[%tqu "En","There is more then one
way to win the piece back, which one do you choose?","","","e7c7","",10]} Qc7

Qa1+ 33. Bd1 Bf8 34. Kg2 Qxa6 35. Bb3 Qf6 36. Qxb5 {One extra pawn and one
weakness on f7. I will leave it to the endgame experts to tell me if White can
make real progress, it looks like a dentist pulling out teeth with a pair of
pliars! Not much fun!} Kg7 37. h4 h5 38. Qc4 Be7 39. e4 Qe6 40. Qd4+ Bf6 41.

48. Kh3 Kg7 49. Qd5 Bc5 50. Qe4 Bb6 51. f5 {Nakamura goes for it. He has
improved his position as much as possible and put his king out of the way on
h3.} gxf5 52. Qxf5 Bc7 53. e6 Qf6 {If this is a draw then Qf6 will be seen as
a move beyond the young Dutchman's years. We have all heard of the drawing
tendencies of the bishops of opposite colours and here seems to be another
example.} 54. Qxf6+ (54. Qxh5 $2 {would allow an instant draw with} Qf1+ $11)
54... Kxf6 55. exf7 {Have a long look, it takes a while for the penny to drop
but there is no way to penetrate with the extra f and h pawns. Excellent
defence shown!} Bd6 56. Kg2 Kg6 57. Kf3 Kf6 58. Ke4 Kg7 59. Kf5 Bxg3 60. Kg5
