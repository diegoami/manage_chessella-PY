Bh4 Na6 9. e3 Nb4 10. Qb3 Bf5 11. Rc1 c5 {Lupulescu's last move is a clear
indication that he wants to make use of his lead in development. It looks scary
for White as he is still is some time away from castling. But Ivanchuk knows no
fears.} 12. dxc5 $1 Qa5 13. Nd4 $1 Nd3+ (13... Bg6 14. Be2 Nd3+ 15. Bxd3 Bxd3
16. c6 {transposes to the game.}) 14. Bxd3 Bxd3 {At first sight this looks
pretty good for Black who has prevented his opponent from castling. But the
Ukrainian has seen further.} 15. c6 $1 (15. Qxb7 {is also strong, but humans
don't play this way when their king is in the centre.}) 15... Bc4 16. Qa4 Qc5
(16... Qxa4 17. Nxa4 bxc6 18. Nxc6 Bd6 {is the best line of play according to
the computer. But for a human player it looks pretty bad to go into such an
ending with a pawn less.} 19. Bxf6 gxf6 20. b3 Bb5 21. Nd4 $16) 17. cxb7 Rab8
18. b3 Bd3 19. Kd2 $1 {I like this bold move connecting the rooks. The king
feels at home on d2.} Bg6 20. Bxf6 $1 {A nice simplifying idea. } Bxf6 21. Ne4

Ivanchuk's move looks winning on the surface, but it gives Black strong
counterplay.}) 27... Rxb7 28. Nxf8 Rb4 $6 (28... Qe4 $1 {would have muddied the
water to quite some extent.} 29. Kg1 (29. Rg1 Qd3+ 30. Kg2 Qe4+ 31. f3 Bxf3+
