{There is always this obvious distinction in styles, let's take for the sake
of exemplification the case of Karpov vs Kasparov. One's signature is the
surgical technique while the other's trademark is the powerful fireworks.
Which one would you appreciate more? That's right, you can't compare apples
with pears:) In other words, if sometimes I bring you too many tactical
examples, I would like to hang in the balance two positional moments now.  The
first one was beautifully spot on by the famous Swedish player, Pia:} 21. d5 $1
Bxc3 22. Qxc3 exd5 23. Nd4 Qd7 24. c5 {[%csl Ra8] A positional pawn sacrifice
aiming to suffocate the bishop on a8. According to the engines, the current
position is quite balanced and with correct (or rather computer play) the
outcome should still be an equally divided one. The game was indeed drawn
eventually but it doesn't take away the instructive lesson performed by White
in the middlegame.} 1/2-1/2

come easy.} 21... b5 {[%cal Gd7b6,Gb6c4,Gb6d5] A fellow friend of mine would
