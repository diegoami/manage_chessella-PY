21. Qe2 Bxa6 22. Qxa6 Bxe5 23. dxe5 $14 {Let's have a look at this position in
some depth. What do you think about the evaluation of this position? Let's try
to understand the imbalances. 1. White has more space thanks to his e5 pawn
and his knight can jump to a nice outpost on d6. The space issue doesn't
handicap Black completely because there are not many pieces on the board.
However, still it does look a tad uncomfortable for Black. 2. The c-file is
completely in White's control. He can double his rooks, but because c7 is
always guarded it is not such a big issue. 3. White has doubled pawns on the
kingside and this is not a big drawback. In fact it can be used to launch a
slow attack on Black's king with ideas like g4-g3-Kg2 and so on. All in all it
seems like White should have a small edge here. It is quite amazing that in 15
moves, White loses the game.} Rd7 {Ganguly decides to double the rooks down
the d-file.} 24. Rd2 Rad8 25. Qe2 {The queen wasn't doing much on a6 and so it
comes back.} Rc7 26. Rcd1 {Keeping the two rooks on the board ensures that
White has good attacking chances.} (26. Rxc7 Nxc7) 26... Rdc8 {It's Black who
now has the c-file under his control, at least temporarily.} 27. Nd6 Rf8 28.
Rd4 {The rook is planning to swing over to g4. Surya now feels a bit
suffocated and tries to break free.} f6 $5 29. Nb5 (29. exf6 Qxd6) 29... Rd7
30. exf6 Qxf6 {The structure has changed once again and new imbalances have
been created. Black's space issues have been resolved, but he now has a new
weakness - the pawn on e6. White can now build up on it and create a lot of
pressure.} 31. Re4 {The rook is well placed on e4 but tactically it could have
been better to continue with Ra4.} (31. R4d2 {[%cal Gb5d4,Gd4f3] to get the
knight to d4 and f3 was also a solid way to continue.}) (31. Ra4 $1 Qf7 32. Nd4
Rfd8 33. Re1 Nf6 34. Nf3 $14 {[%csl Re6] White has been able to coordinate his
forces much better than what he did in the game and keep pressure.}) 31... a6
32. Nd4 Nc7 {Surya has to go slightly passive in order to defend his e6 pawn.
But you can see that White is experiencing small problems related to his
coordination. The knight on d4 cannot move as then Rxd1 Qxd1 will hang the b2
pawn. And next Rfd8 is coming up.} 33. Rd3 (33. Rf4 $5 Qd8 34. Rxf8+ Qxf8 (

But Wang Hao had this covered.} 34. Rf3 {Attacking the queen.} Qg5 35. Rff4 $6

you have a small edge.}) 35... Nd5 36. Nxe6 $6 {Wang Hao takes the pawn on e6
and forks two of Black's pieces.} (36. Rh4 {And it doesn't seem like in this
position White can be worse.}) 36... Nxf4 {As the queen is hanging on e2 with
a check, the knight has to be taken.} 37. Rxf4 $2 {The losing mistake of the
game.} (37. gxf4 Rd1+ 38. Kh2 Qh4#) (37. Nxf4 {[%csl Gf4] is a forced move.
Although Black is materially up now, The position is around even because the
knight is well placed on f4.}) 37... Re7 $1 {Ganguly was extremely alert and
he finds the best possibility in the position. Now taking the queen is not
possible as his own queen on e2 is hanging.} (37... Re8 38. Rf8+ Rxf8 39. Nxg5

save everything and next Rde8 will win the house. Also the threat is to play
Qd1+ and exchange the queens. Seeing all of this Wang Hao resigned and Ganguly
moved closer towards tournament victory and US $50,000.} 0-1
