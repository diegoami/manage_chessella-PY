1. e4 $1 {Minasian opts for 1.e4 but a sideline will ensue nevertheless!
Minasian was never a theoretical player!} c5  2. Nc3  e6  3. f4 {(1:28)
Minasian goes for GP attack.} Nc6  4. Nf3  a6  5. d4 {(4:32) A change of heart!
Minasian goes for the Open Sicilian main line. He must have been very inspired
to play this style!} cxd4  6. Nxd4  Nxd4  (6... Qc7 {is what is considered as
the main line in this 'Sicilian Taimanov'.}) 7. Qxd4  b5  8. Be3 {(5:03) A
natural move played after some thought. White is planning to castle queenside.}
Bb7  9. O-O-O {(51) A rare line with mixed results.} Rc8  10. Kb1  (10. Be2 {is
a natural move which was chosen by Israeli GM Ilja Smirin with good success.}
Nf6 11. Bf3 Be7 (11... b4 {is probably the move to consider here.} 12. Na4 d5
13. exd5 Bxd5 14. Bxd5 Nxd5 15. f5 {with extreme complications.}) 12. e5 Bxf3
13. gxf3 Nh5 14. Ne4 {And White is already much better.} f5 15. exf6 Nxf6 16.

(27) Smirin,I (2663)-Rublevsky,S (2695) Khanty-Mansiysk 2013}) 10... Ne7
{(10:50) Typical, but I am not sure if it is sufficient for a balanced fight.}
(10... Nf6 {was examined before by a young Ukrainian-American GM where things
backfired after} 11. e5 Ng4 12. Ne4 Bd5 13. a3 Qa5 14. Bc1 b4 15. Nd6+ Bxd6 16.
exd6 O-O 17. h3 bxa3 $2 (17... Nf6 18. Qxb4 Qxb4 19. axb4 Be4 20. Bd3 Bxg2 21.
Rh2 Bf3 22. Rg1 Rc6 {and Black is fine.}) 18. Bd2 $1 Qc5 19. Qxc5 Rxc5 20. hxg4

gxh6 34. Rxa3 Rg1+ {1-0 (34) Cuartas, J (2483)-Zherebukh,Y (2618) Montcada
2014}) 11. Be2  Nc6  12. Qb6 $1 {(6:08) Otherwise, Black's attack could become
very annoying. White opts for some endgame where he has good pressure along the
d-file.} Qxb6  13. Bxb6  Bb4  14. Rd3  Ne7  (14... Bxc3 15. Rxc3 Ne7 {and Black
is fine thanks to the tactics involving the bishop on b6.}) 15. Rhd1  Bxc3  16.
Rxd7 {(03:10) A tactical sequence starts which requires a lot of accuracy from
both sides, but the ensuing forced position is approximately balanced.} Bd5 
17. Rc7 $1 {(3:45) The only move.} Rxc7  18. Bxc7 {(25) Now the bishop on d5 is
pinned to the d8 square.} Bb4 $6 {(6:11) This is a precious loss of tempo.}
(18... Kd7 $1 19. Be5 (19. exd5 Kxc7 20. d6+ Kc6 21. dxe7 Bf6 {with a drawish
endgame.}) 19... Bxe5 20. fxe5 Kc7 21. exd5 Nxd5 22. c4 Nf4 23. Bf1 b4 24. Rd6
Ra8 25. c5 Ng6 26. Bxa6 Rb8 27. Kc2 Nxe5 {with an equal position but it is far
from drawn. It is funny, but this endgame is very similar to Fischer-Petrosian
Bled 1961!}) 19. a3  Bc5  20. Bf3 $1 {(2:27) An important move which reinforces
White's bishop pair and his pressure along the center.} Kd7  21. Be5  f6  22.

 28. b4 $1 {(3:16) Fixing the queenside. The position is far from lost but
Minasian is pushing his opponent to the edge.} Rf8  29. Kb3  Rc8  30. Ra1 $1
{(3:12) Minasian gradually follows his plan. He is going to undermine Black's
queenside which soon would become very vulnerable.} Rc4  31. a4  g5 $1 {(28)
the best way to make things muddy!} 32. axb5  axb5  33. Ra7+  Ke6  34. fxg5 
fxg5  (34... Nc6 $3 35. Rxh7 d4 36. Be1 Bxb4 37. Bxb4 Rxb4+ 38. Ka2 Ne5 {would
have given Black excellent drawing chances!}) 35. Be2  Nc6  36. Rxh7  Nd4+  37.
Bxd4  Rxd4  38. c3  Rd2  39. Rh6+  Ke7  40. Bxb5  Be5  41. Ba6  Rf2  42. Bb7
{(2:15) Good enough. Minasian plays with patience and care.} Rd2  43. Bc8  Kd8 
44. Bf5  Rf2  45. Bg4  Rf7  46. Re6  Re7  47. Kc2 $1 {(1:15) Classy! Black had
his rook tied to the exchange of pieces which is unfavorable for him. In the
meantime Minasian brings his king to the game!} Ke8  48. Kd3  Kf7  49. Rc6  Bf6
 50. b5  Rb7  51. Rc5 {(35) White is going to win the next pawn and the game is
completely won so the Georgian strong GM throws in the towel. Minasian once
more showed that his experience and knowledge of chess is beyond the Elo number
tied to his name in FIDE rating list.} 1-0
