1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 d5 5. h4 $5 {Pert tries to play an
aggressive system in this almost must-win situation.} c6 {David is as solid as
he can be.} 6. cxd5 cxd5 7. Bf4 Nc6 8. e3 O-O 9. Ne5 Nxe5 10. Bxe5 Ne4 11. Bxg7
Nxc3 12. bxc3 Kxg7 13. Bd3 (13. h5 $1 {What I do not understand is why Nick
didn't push his h-pawn. The h-file will be opened and White could get decent
attcking chances.}) 13... h5 {Now the h-file cannot be opened and the position
is just equal.} 14. Qb3 Qd6 15. O-O Rb8 16. Rfc1 Bd7 17. Qb4 Qxb4 {Howell
thought for a long time before making this queen exchange.} 18. cxb4 Rfc8 19.
