O-O 9. Ng3 a6 10. a4 Ne8 11. Be2 h5 {Pushing the h-pawn ahead is a common idea
in many King's Indian structure but in this position it is a new move.} 12. Be3

19. Ne3 Re8 20. Rf1 $5 {The beginning of an interesting idea. Hard to believe
but White gives up his right to castle to attack the h-pawn.} Rb8 21. Rf3 Qg6 {
Black gives the pawn to bring his pieces into a play. For a human mind White's
rook maneuver might appear too time-consuming and rather artificial and Black
seems to have a lot of compensation for the pawn. However, the engines condone
White's play and consider White's to be clearly better here.} 22. Rh3 Nf6 23.
Rxh4 Bd7 24. Kf2 b5 25. axb5 axb5 {Black threatens ...b4, followed by ...Ne4+,
White's rook on h4 looks to be out of play and Black seems to have very active
pieces. Still, the engines insist that White is better.} 26. Kg1 Re7 27. Rh3
Ng4 28. Ra7 b4 29. Ncd1 Rbe8 30. Rf3 Nh5 {(#)} 31. Rxd7 {A little tactical
trick to exchange pieces.} Rxd7 32. Bb5 Rde7 33. Bxe8 Rxe8 34. h3 Ngf6 35. Nf2
Ng3 36. Qd1 ({The engines like the exchange sacrifice} 36. Rxg3 Qxg3 37. Nxf5
Qg6 38. g4 {and evaluate the position as clearly better for White.}) 36... Kh8
{To attack on the g-file.} 37. Kh2 Rg8 38. b3 Nge4 {Threatening 39...Nxf2.} 39.
Qe1 (39. Nh1 {is the move the engine recommends - with an equal position.})
39... Nxd5 40. g4 Nxe3 41. Rxe3 d5 {(#) Now Black finally gets the upper-hand.}
42. Nd3 $2 ({Better was} 42. Nxe4 fxe4 ({but not} 42... dxe4 43. Qh4+ Kg7 44.
Qe7+ Qf7 45. Qxc5) 43. f5 Qf6 {with a sharp double-edged but dynamically equal
position.}) 42... fxg4 43. hxg4 Qxg4 44. Rh3+ Kg7 45. Rh4 Qxh4+ 46. Qxh4 Rh8
47. Qxh8+ Kxh8 {(#)Black liquidated into a knight ending with an extra pawn
that looks promising. However, he has technical difficulties. The c-pawn
cannot advance easily because it has to protect the b-pawn and the knight on
e4 is tied to the defense of the c-pawn.} 48. Kh3 Kg7 49. Kg4 Kf6 50. f5 Ke7
51. Kh5 Kf7 52. Kg4 Nf6+ 53. Kg5 Nd7 54. f6 Ke6 55. Kg6 c4 {How else should
Black make progress?} 56. bxc4 dxc4 57. Nxb4 Nxf6 {(#) According to the
Nalimov tablebases this position is a draw. But in the further course of the
game Ding Liren does not find the right defense.} 58. Kg5 Nd5 59. Nc6 c3 60.
