$5 {An energetic move by Adhiban.} exf4 16. Bxf4 Nc5 $2 (16... a6 {made
complete sense and Black shouldn't have too many issues.}) 17. Bxd6 Qxd6 18.

Nxb3 19. axb3 {All of White's pieces work wonderfully well. The rook on a1 is
strong and so is the bishop on g2.The rook on f1 is also very powerful. All in

finishing shot. An important win in the ninth round that helped Adhiban win
the tournament.} 1-0
