{The next three games illustrate the opposite, when top players face
difficulties in finding the right balance between risk and safety, between
practical and impractical. But also it shows the maturity of young and
talented players, perhaps the rising gods of tomorrow...} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6

breakfast table and is willing to share his thoughts on a painful loss he
suffered, you can only be all ears, trying not to miss a word! And I didn't
miss any of it, only this visual memory of mine is terrible...I cannot
reconstruct precisely the lines he mentioned, so I am forced to skip that part.
You know this smiley on skype, where the yellow face is hitting its head on a
wall? I am doing that as I type. But I do remember vividly the overall
impression: strong characters don't cry and go on to analyze, even during the
tournament. Peter mentioned lines to such depths and extents that give me an
excuse for being unable to bring them back to you. Let me put it upfront: the
will to win is there, perhaps to poisonous extents. And what we see on the
screens and tournament standings is only a part of the story.} ({This line I
do recall though, which, indeed, would have been better.} 19... Ne5 {is what

alternative looked tempting as well.}) 20. Ng3 Kh6 21. Bc1 $1 {As mentioned
before, backwards moves are not only surprising but also counter-intuitive,
especially in attack. This strong retreat took Leko by surprise. Please check
the R5 CB article if you wish to have a deeper look.} ({If one looks quickly
through the game, would conclude that ahhh....Black was losing anyway, since
White had also:} 21. Nxh5 Kxh5 22. Ra3 Bxf4 23. Rh3+ Kg5 24. Rxh7 {Both
players missed that, so how can it be so easy?!}) 21... Bxc1 22. Rxc1 Ne5 23.

lines are some schematic openings, some typical positions where they can play
back and forth, trying to convert a minimal advantage. But surely most of the
times they wouldn't choose Botvinnik against a lower rated and young opponent!
Besides, the Dutch are known to have made the computer one of their best
friends. You don't want to mess up with them in opening discussions...I know
this because I live with one at home:)} Rxg5 {Before playing this move, Alexei
