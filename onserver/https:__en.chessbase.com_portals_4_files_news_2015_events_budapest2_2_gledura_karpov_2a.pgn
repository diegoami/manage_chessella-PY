1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c6 {(!!) An admirable decision. Karpov has never ever played
the Slav in his life, but his never ceasing passion for chess makes him trying
new openings even though nowadays he does not have too much time to study.
When playing the last move, Karpov might not have been aware that his decision
is similar to that of his first historic rival, Kortschnoj. At the age of 70,
Viktor Lvovich used the Slav for almost the first time in his life (exluding a
couple of irrelevant old games) to defeat Boris Gelfand in Biel 2001!} 3. Nc3

O-O Bf5 12. Qd1 Bg7 13. b4 {[#]Following Karpov live was a thrilling
experience. I could not refrain from whispering to my son my thoughts. The
playing hall was set up as a big amphitheatre and our seats were far away from
the boards, so I guess the slight violation of the rules for spectators did
not disturb the players in any way. Having studied so many of Karpov's games
as a teenager, I was not surprized that I could guess many of his moves, but I
could not help thinking that Karpov was less sure of himself, since he played
very slowly and his moves usually arrived at least one minute after I thought
them up. In this moment, though, I could feel the difference of class between
me and my former idol. I told my son that Black is doing well with the
exception of the fact that his major pieces are not connected properly, but
could not come up with a concrete suggestion. Karpov's next two moves offer a
brilliantly simple solution.} O-O 14. Bb2 Ra8 15. a4 b5 {A double edged
decision, exposing the b-pawn to later positional piece sacrifices on b5.} (
15... Qc7 16. b5 e5 {was a worthy alternative.}) 16. cxb6 $6 {This frees Black
of any worries.} Qxb6 17. Ba3 a5 $2 ({Not at all typical for Karpov. In his
best days, he would think of completing his development before making a pawn
break. For instance} 17... Rfe8 {would over-defend the e7-pawn, not only
making ...a6-a5 more viable, but also preparing a possible .. .e7-e5.}) 18. b5
$1 {Suddenly, White has strong initiative.} Rfe8 19. bxc6 Qxc6 20. Rc1 Qb7 21.
Nb5 Rac8 {[#]} 22. Bxe7 $1 {A simple but elegant combination, based on White's
superior activity and the hanging black pieces.} Ne4 (22... Rxc1 23. Qxc1 Rxe7
24. Nd6 Qb6 25. Nxf5) 23. Ba3 Rxc1 24. Qxc1 Rc8 25. Qb2 Nb6 {Black's
counterplay does not compensate for the pawn since the g7-bishop is a mere
spectator. This piece would have needed the e-pawn to clear the long diagonal
by means of ...e7-e5.} 26. Qb3 g4 27. Ne5 Nd2 28. Qd1 {After this move Karpov
still had around 15 seconds on his clock, but in his hopeless attempt to find
a proper continuation he lost on time.} (28. Qd1 Nxf1 29. Nd6) 1-0
