mate with} Qd1+ {because it is prettier than Rg1:)} 36. Bc1 Qxc1+ 37. Kxc1 Rg1+
) 35... Qxe6 36. Qxe6+ Kxe6 37. Bxe3 Rg3 {White suffered a lot but managed to
escape with half a point. As for Black, Martin was a tough cookie this
tournament, holding and winning against higher rated players which shows, once
again, that having too much respect for your opponent is very polite indeed
but this is not how chess business is done in this part of the world! They
just want to play a good game of chess and are not shy to win it either.}
