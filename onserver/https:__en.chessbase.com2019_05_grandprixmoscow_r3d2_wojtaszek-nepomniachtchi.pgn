Nf3 g6 3. b4 Bg7 4. Bb2 O-O 5. e3 d6 6. Be2 c5 $5 $132 {is a good example of
what White probably wanted to avoid by delaying b4 while still intending to
play it- see next note.}) 2... g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. e3 {This particular move-order
looks unambitious, and signals some kind of fear of the Grunfeld, although
White has a setup in mind which can be dangerous in the right hands.} O-O 5.
Be2 d6 6. Nc3 Nbd7 7. O-O e5 8. b4 $5 {This order is interesting. Normally,
when White tries to play against the KID with b4, he pushes the pawn early,
for instance 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.b4- which is then well met by a later ...c5.
Here, of course, it is hard to combine ...e5 and ...c5, so White has averted
that particular danger.} Re8 9. Bb2 exd4 $5 {This is a reasonable and
practical approach.} ({Many Black players opt for something like} 9... e4 10.
Nd2 c6 11. a4 d5 12. a5 {but White's queenside play is greatly accelerated
compared to a normal KID, and with the breaks a6 and b5 in imminent prospect
he will be able to dismantle Black's structure a lot more easily than normal.})
({I suspect the very best move is} 9... a5 {, intending to take on d4 in case
White tries b5, but to play ...e4 otherwise.} 10. a3 (10. b5 $6 exd4 $1 11.
Nxd4 (11. exd4 Nb6 12. a4 Bg4 $15 {Black has obtained some kind of
super-Alekhine, and could easily be better already.}) 11... Nc5 12. Nb3 a4 $5
13. Nxc5 a3 14. Bc1 dxc5 $132) 10... e4 $5 {Maybe even more accurate is . ..c6
first, since White can't very well reply b5.} 11. Nd2 c6 12. Qc2 d5 13. b5 Nf8
$132 {Black's structure can no longer be undermined by pawn breaks alone,
though White should still be able to get good play along the open b- and
c-files.}) 10. Nxd4 ({After} 10. exd4 $6 {there are several problems, one of
which is that after} d5 $5 {the d4-pawn will be weak regardless of how White
chooses to handle the immediate challenge to c4.}) 10... a5 11. a3 Ne5 12. Qb3
{This is the move that makes equality almost certain. Preventing Black's next,
and therefore leaving a piece on the board for him that is more passive than
its White counterpart, was the way to go.} ({After} 12. h3 {Black can keep the
balance, but only by latching onto this new weakness:} Bd7 13. Qd2 g5 $5 $132 {
or similar.}) (12. Nd5 $5 {was the most ambitious move, making Black work for
his light-square bishop trade and also making the dark-square bishop trade
more likely.} Ne4 $1 {Drawing the queen away from the defence of g4.} ({
Following something compliant like} 12... c6 13. Nxf6+ Bxf6 14. Bc3 axb4 15.
axb4 $14 {Black cannot be happy with the outcome of the opening.}) 13. Qc2 c6

Ng5 15. h3 Bd7 $132 {Black's knights are clumsy, but then so are White's.})
14... Nxc3 15. Bxc3 Bg4 16. bxa5 Bxe2 17. Qxe2 Nd7 $44) 12... Bg4 13. Rad1 ({
The computer has clearly not seen enough Bronstein games to steer well clear
of ideas like} 13. f3 $5 {- this was maybe the last chance for the game to
become double-edged.} Bh6 14. Nc2 Bd7 15. Nd5 Nxd5 16. cxd5 a4 17. Qa2 $132)
13... axb4 14. axb4 Bxe2 15. Ndxe2 c6 {At this point, it was probably clear to
both players that they could not realistically hope for an advantage.} 16. h3
Qe7 17. Nd4 Ned7 18. Ra1 Nb6 19. Rxa8 ({The 'minority attack' with} 19. b5 {
would fail in its main objective of creating a target on c6, and instead White
has to deal with the reality of Black's f6-knight trying to make itself at
home on c5. Still, if the players had been desperate to make a game of it,
maybe this could have been played.} Qc7 20. Rfb1 Nfd7 21. Rxa8 Rxa8 22. bxc6

likely ...Ne4, White certainly has nothing in particular to play for, and it
seems Black doesn't either.} 1/2-1/2
