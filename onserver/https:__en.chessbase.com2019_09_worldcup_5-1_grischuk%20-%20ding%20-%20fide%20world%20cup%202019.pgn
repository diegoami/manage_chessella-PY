c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3 dxc4 5. Bg2 a6 6. O-O Nc6 7. e3 Rb8 8. Nfd2 e5 {This is
the main move. If White can play moves like Nfd2, Black must try and take
advantage of it by playing in the centre.} 9. Bxc6+ (9. Nxc4 exd4 $11) 9...
bxc6 10. dxe5 Ng4 11. Nxc4 Be6 12. Qe2 {Grischuk goes for the relatively
lesser played move.} (12. Nbd2 {is the main move and was already seen in the
game between Ding and Mamedyarov.} h5 13. f3 Rb4 14. fxg4 Bxc4 15. Nxc4 Qxd1
16. Rxd1 Rxc4 17. Bd2 $14 {White is definitely is pushing here.}) 12... h5 13.
Rd1 Qc8 {This has been seen before in the game Vorobiov Goudriaan. Black's
idea is simple. He would like to play ...h4. And simply run over White's
kingside.} (13... Qe7 {was Ilincic vs Ashwin. Black won after} 14. f3 Qc5 15.
Nbd2 Nxe5 $11) 14. Qf3 $5 {Grischuk definitely didn't make this move very
happily. But he realized that he must do something drastic against Black's
threat of h4 and found this interesting move.} (14. h4 g5 {is really something
to worry about.} 15. hxg5 h4) (14. f3 h4 15. Nc3 hxg3 16. fxg4 Bxg4 17. Qg2

is already quite a dangerous position for White.} 15. Qf3 $5 hxg3 16. hxg3 Be7

White seems to be doing fine here.}) 15. Qxc4 Nxe5 16. Qe4 Bd6) 14... Rb6 $5 {
It's quite puzzling that in this position where Ding Liren could have chosen a
winning move, he goes for an inferior move that gives him dynamic equality.} (
14... Qb7 {is just not in the spirit of the position.} 15. b3 (15. Na5 Nxe5 $15
) 15... h4 16. h3 $18 {With the queen on b7, no attack really works.}) (14...
Bd5 $1 {A lot of people started shouting that this position is simply winning
for Black. If it were so easy, then wouldn't a 2800+ player find it? Let's try
to understand why Ding Liren didn't play this?} 15. Rxd5 (15. Qe2 h4 $19 {
is not even required to be analyzed. The attack is decisive.}) 15... cxd5 16.
Qxd5 Qf5 $1 {There is a mate on f2.} (16... Be7 17. f3 h4 (17... Nh6 18. Nc3
$44) 18. Nbd2 hxg3 19. hxg3 {The position is complex and I am not sure about
the assessment.}) 17. f3 {is what both Ding Liren and Grischuk were worried
about.} (17. f4 Qc2 18. Nbd2 (18. Qd2 Qxc4) 18... Qd1+ $19 19. Kg2 Qe2+ 20. Kg1
Qf2+) 17... Qc2 {It's easy to miss this move. It hits the h2 and c1. The point
is that interposing on d2 means that the Queen can go to d1 and finish off the
game. And Qd2 fails to Qxc4. So surprisingly White's options are quite few.}
18. Qc6+ $1 (18. Qd2 Qxc4 $19) (18. Nbd2 $2 Qd1+ 19. Nf1 {simply loses the
queen. So it is important to first give a check on c6.} Qxd5) 18... Kd8 (18...

Kg2 (21. Nf1) 21... Qe2+) 19... Qd1+ 20. Nf1 {Let's say White gets some time
here, then he simply goes Bd2 and finishes Black off.} Nxh2 $1 (20... Z0 21.

White's threats.} (21... Qxf1 22. e6 $1 fxe6 (22... Qd3 23. Ne5 Qe2+ 24. Kh1
