keeping the king in the center, and letting Black guess what he'll do next,
while gaining space on the kingside.} Bg6 12. h4 h6 13. f4 {Gaining space is a
way to win a game, because one is more free to shuffle the pieces around. At
the same time the other side of the coin are the weaknesses created with each
pawn push.} b6 14. cxb6 axb6 15. Bd2 Bd6 16. a3 {This is a waiting game. White
is waiting to see where Black will move the king, but Black doesn't want to
move it, to avoid to give White a clear plan. At the same time White is
thinking to use the semi-open C file, and to play Rc1, he needs to have the
Pa2 protected, but if also the Qb3 would be needed elsewhere, the Pa2 would be
left hanging, hence this move which could seem a waste of time.} Nf6 17. Rc1 {

this is a blitz game.} 22. Nxd6 Kxd6 23. Bb4+ c5 24. dxc5+ bxc5 {Now White
must be very careful, while it is true the Pc5 is pinned, also the Bb4 can be
pinned by Rb8. Probably it's still equal.}) 22. Nxd6 Kxd6 23. Bb4+ $6 (23. Qb4+

problem. White has 2 passed pawns on the queenside, but opposite color bishops
requires precise play for winning, and this is a blitz game.}) 29... Qb5 {

point White thought a lot, a little more than 15 seconds, which for a game
with time control 3 minutes is a lot. By now White has 57 seconds left, and
Black 2 minutes.} 33. Rc1 (33. Qf6 $1 {exploiting the weak dark squares

the queenside.}) 33... Qd3 {Black tries to enter White's territory, and is
threatening a double attack like Qd2.} 34. Qb2 $6 {White returns back. A very

there is a checkmate here, but how to calculate it, with only 45 seconds left??

Morphy taught us, one needs to go for the checkmate. The enemy king is in the
center, the Ra1 out of the game (this is a +5 advantage the engine would give
us in this position) and not enough time to use it for protecting the White
king. Congratulations to Mr. Duncan for playing a la Morphy!} (23... Bh6 {
