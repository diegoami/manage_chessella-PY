however, in this game Black's concept could not convince entirely.} (6... a6)

white-squared bishop is a rare guest in tournaments.} 9. Nd2 Nf6 10. Bg2 O-O

decide on which square to put his queen.} 14. Na4 Ng4 15. Bb2 Bxb2 (15... Nde5)

soon be chased away by h3. ...Qa7 combined with ...Ba6 and ...Rfb8 was worth
considering, after all, the biggest weakness in White's camp is the pawn on b3
and not the pawn on e2.} 21. Rf2 Rfc8 $6 {Black seems to want to play ...c4.}

tries to stop White's expansion but Keymer continues his robust play.} (24. e5

continues his uncompromising attack.} Rf7 $2 {An unfortunate position for the
rook. The engines want to activate the other rook and put it to b8 though they
still think that White has the better chances.} 28. Nd3 $1 {The knight knows
his way.} c4 29. Nf4 (29. bxc4 $5 Bxa4 (29... Nxa4 30. c5 $5 Nxc5 31. Nxc5 dxc5

Vincent does not shy away from unusual material balances which indicates
self-confidence and is a strength.} Rxg5 37. hxg5 $18 Qe3 38. Kh1 Nc5 39. Nxh7
