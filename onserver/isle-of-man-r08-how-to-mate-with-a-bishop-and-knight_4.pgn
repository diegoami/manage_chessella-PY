{Battles between Nakamura and Wesley So are always interesting. In their last
encounter Wesley won with the white pieces at the Sinquefield Cup. So Nakamura
was surely angling for a revenge.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. f3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5.
e4 Nb6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O {Theory has been growing in
the f3 line of the Grunfeld. This opposite side castling position is quite
sharp and not everything has been worked out here. Hence, there is quite some
scope for experimentation and new ideas.} Qd6 10. Nb5 Qd7 11. Kb1 Rd8 12. d5 a6

anything special out of the opening and this looks like heading towards a dull
draw.} 23. Be2 c6 24. Rxd7 Bxd7 25. Rc1 Be6 26. Nd1 Rd8 27. Ne3 Rd2 28. Rc2
