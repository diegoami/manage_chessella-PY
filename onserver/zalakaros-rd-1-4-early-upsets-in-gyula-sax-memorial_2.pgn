1. e4 c6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Ne4 5. Ne2 Qb6 6. d4 e6 7. Nfg1 f6 8. exf6
$5 {A new move in a well known position. Very interesting and original play!} (
8. f3 Ng5 9. exf6 gxf6 10. f4 {is the mainline. This position is immensely
complicated.}) 8... Nxf6 9. Nf3 c5 10. Nf4 cxd4 11. Bd3 Bd6 12. O-O {Black is a
pawn up, but White is set to regain it, as d4 and e6 is weak. Under such
circumstances, it'll be ideal if Black can find a way to keep the pawn, as
these are central pawns that exert a lot of control over important squares.} e5
(12... O-O 13. Re1 (13. Ng5 h6 14. Ngxe6 Bxe6 15. Nxe6 Bxh2+ 16. Kxh2 Qxe6 $15)
13... Na6 $1 {it's a complicated position, but Black is better.}) 13. Re1 Nc6
14. Ng5 e4 $2 {[#]} (14... Bd7 $142) 15. Nxd5 $1 Nxd5 16. Nxe4 {The bishop on
d6 holds together Black's position, however it is vulnerable. Black's position
gets very difficult upon it's elimination.} (16. Bxe4 Nde7 17. Qh5+ Kd7 18. Bd2
$16 {[#] was also very strong, but not easy for a human to evaluate this
accurately.}) 16... Nce7 17. c4 Nf6 {[#]} 18. Nxf6+ $2 {Keeping concrete
details aside, I feel that White should've gone after the dark square bishop.}
(18. c5 $142 $1 Bxc5 19. Nxc5 Qxc5 20. Bf4 $16 {The e7 knight's fall is just a
matter of time.}) 18... gxf6 19. Qh5+ Kd8 20. Bd2 a5 21. Qf7 Bd7 {White's
attack has fizzled out and Black seems alright. But Svane has just 8 minutes
for 19 moves and Abhimanyu knows exactly how to set difficult problems for
opponent's in these circumstances.} 22. g3 Bc5 23. Re2 Ng6 24. Rae1 Rf8 $6 (
24... Qd6 $142 25. f4 Kc8 {was the right way to go, and in a handful of moves,
Black would've a winning position.}) 25. Qg7 Ne5 26. Rxe5 $1 fxe5 27. Rxe5 {
Black has just 3 minutes for 13 moves. I will refrain from commenting on every
move from here as game goes into a crazy time scramble.} Kc7 (27... Kc8 { seems
safer, from first impression.}) 28. Qg5 Bb4 29. Bf4 Kc8 30. a3 h6 31. Qg7 Bd6
32. c5 Bxc5 33. Rd5 Be6 34. Rh5 Rg8 $4 {[#]} (34... Rf7 $142 35. Qe5 Bf8 { not
allowing Bf5.}) 35. Qe5 Bf8 36. Bf5 Kd7 37. Qd5+ Ke7 38. Bxe6 {Now it's just
over} Rd8 39. Bd7 Bg7 40. Qe4+ Kf7 41. Rb5 Qf6 42. Qd5+ Ke7 43. Rxb7 { It may
appear like Abhimanyu got lucky in both the games, but the truth is, he is
actually a master in setting his opponent very difficult practical problems.
Legends like Tal,Shirov had similar qualities as well and they used these tools
against the highest opposition.} 1-0
