1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 e6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 {We have the Meran System on
the board and Anish Giri is considered to be quite an expert in it from both
sides.} 6. Qc2 Bd6 7. Be2 {This is much more subtle than the more popular Bd3.
It avoids the e6-e5 ideas in the future.} O-O 8. O-O dxc4 9. Bxc4 b5 10. Be2
Bb7 11. e4 e5 12. dxe5 Nxe5 13. Nd4 {Results-wise this line has scored very
well for White. But you can be sure that when Giri plays it he has analyzed it
really well.} Neg4 14. g3 (14. h3 Bh2+ 15. Kh1 Nxf2+ 16. Rxf2 Qxd4 $17) 14...
Re8 (14... Bxg3 15. hxg3 Qxd4 16. Qd1 {leads to a favourable ending for White.}
) 15. Nf5 Bc5 16. Bf4 Qb6 17. Kg2 {This has all been seen in a Giri-Shirov game
before. The Latvian genius had taken on f2 here. Giri plays the much better
move ...g6} g6 {This is not a novelty because this has been played by Shirov
recently against Svane.} (17... Nxf2 18. e5 Nd7 19. b4 Bxb4 20. Rxf2 Nxe5 21.
Ne4 c5 22. Kf1 Bxe4 23. Qxe4 {Through highly concrete play Anish had refuted
Black's strategy.}) 18. h3 {[%cal Gh2h3]} Ne5 $146 {The first new move of the
game and quite a good one.} (18... gxf5 19. hxg4 Bd4 (19... fxg4 20. e5 $18)
20. gxf5 Bxc3 21. bxc3 c5 {Black had comfortably equalized in Svane-Shirov.})
19. Nh6+ Kg7 20. Bg5 Bd4 21. Bxf6+ Kxf6 {Giri's king looks precariously placed
on f6, but it is not so easy to get to it.} 22. f4 Nc4 23. Bxc4 bxc4 24. f5
{[#] This was the critical position of the entire game.} c5 $1 (24... Kg7
{looks humanly natural to run away from the f1 rook. After the game Nakamura
said that he was hoping for Giri to make this move as he had prepared a very
nice idea. Giri however said that he didn't feel Kg7 was the most human move,
but instead c5 looks natural. Truly these guys are super natural!} 25. fxg6 $1
fxg6 26. Rf7+ $1 Kxh6 27. Raf1 Be3 28. Nd1 $36 {And after the complications end
White will emerge with a better position.}) 25. fxg6+ Kxg6 26. Nxf7 Rf8 {Giri
had passed all the tests with flying colours and it was now time for Hikaru to
pull the breaks.} (26... Re7 $6 27. Nd5 $1) 27. Nd5 Qxb2 28. Ne7+ Kg7 29. Nf5+
Kg6 30. Ne7+ {And a draw was agreed. An important theoretical duel which will
add to development of this variation.} 1/2-1/2
