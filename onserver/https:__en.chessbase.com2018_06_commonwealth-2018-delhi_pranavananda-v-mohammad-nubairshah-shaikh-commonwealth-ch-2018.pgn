Qb7 22. Qxg6 Be4 23. Qg3 Kh7 24. Qh4 Bxf3 25. Rxf3 Ng8 26. Bd3+ Kh8 {White is
completely winning. Not only does he have pieces excellently posted. He also
has an extra pawn. It is important now to finish off the game in the best
possible way.} 27. Rg3 $1 {When you are attacking, it makes complete sense to
keep the pieces on the board. Rg3 is an excellent move by Pranavananda. The
idea is now to take on e7.} Qd5 {Nubair makes the most natural move. He brings
his queen into the action. But now White has many ways to win.} (27... e5 {
seems to be an alternative. The idea is to defend along the second rank.} 28.
Bxh6 $1 {To make a move like this needs tactical awareness of highest order.}

Qg4 $2 {This is a typical lazy move when you are winning. Of course White is
still clearly winning, but it was important to seize the moment.} (28. Rxg7 $1

) 30... Rxa4 $1 {Nubair snaps the pawn and restores the material balance. Of
course, Black is still worse, but now materially you are doing fine.} 31. Bd2
$1 {White keeps his calm and develops the bishop.} Rd4 32. Bc3 Rd5 33. Qf4 Rg5
{I would say that Black has been able to get some order in his position. His
pieces seem to be working together.} 34. Bc2 {I have no idea, what is the
point of this move. But perhaps Pranavananda wanted to avoid e5-e4 and a pawn
fork.} e5 35. Qd2 Qd5 $1 {Tricky tricky! Against tactically sharp players like
Nubair you always have to be careful.} 36. Qe2 $1 (36. Rxf6 {falls to} Qxg2# $1
{That would be cruel!}) 36... Qg8 {Black is also unable to come up with
something concrete.} 37. Bd2 $6 (37. Rd1 $16 {White keeps all of his
advantages and is better.}) 37... e4 $1 38. Rxf6 Bxf6 39. Bxg5 hxg5 (39... Qxg5
40. Qxe4 Qg7 $14 {I think Black would have had excellent chances to draw the
game now.}) 40. Bxe4 $16 {Black's task in this opposite coloured bishop is not
easy as his king is exposed. But from where it all started, he can be very
happy that he is still alive!} Qf7 41. Kh1 $1 {Smart move. Moving the king out
of any immediate checks.} Be5 42. Qg4 Rg8 43. Rd1 Qf4 $2 {Ambitious!} (43...
Rb8 $16 {Black is clinging on.}) 44. Qh5+ $1 {Pranavananda is not afraid and
goes for the black king.} Kg7 45. Qh7+ Kf8 46. g3 Qxf2 47. Ra1 $1 {White has
activated all his pieces. His bishop on e4 ensures that there are no checks on
the light squares! Black is helpless.} Rg7 48. Qh8+ Rg8 49. Qh6+ $2 (49. Ra8+

now winning!} Qf6 (52... Qe2 53. Qh8+ Rg8 54. Ra8+ Ke7 55. Qh7+ Rg7 56. Ra7+

effort.}) 51. Qe6+ Kd8 52. Ra8+ Kc7 53. Qe7+ {A typical struggle and this
happens with us very often in our games. It is important to finish off your
opponent when the chance is offered. Otherwise like in this game, the battle
goes on and the defender is more often than not able to survive. Kudos to
Pranavananda for maintaining his cool.} 1-0
