1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 Nbd7 7. Qe2 {
is not the main move but definitely one to be prepared for} (7. f4 Qc7 8. Qf3 {
is the typical setup in these Bg5 Najdorfs}) 7... Qc7 8. f4 e6 9. O-O-O b5 10.
a3 Bb7 11. g4 Be7 12. Kb1 Rc8 13. Rg1 {So far all the moves have been pretty
standard. Now Black has to come up with something} h6 14. Bh4 g5 {This a
common idea in these lines. Black is sacrificing a pawn in order to control
the important e5-square.} 15. fxg5 hxg5 16. Bxg5 Qb6 {Black is introducing
ideas like ..e5 and ..Rxc3.} (16... Ne5 $2 {is simply met by} 17. Bc1 $16 {
[%cal Rg4g5] and White pretty much has a free hand on the kingside. The bishop
is a good defender on c1}) 17. Rg3 {And White stops both of them with this move
} Rg8 18. h4 Ne5 $2 (18... Rc4 $1 {and White is forced to give up a pawn with}
19. e5 (19. Rgd3 {runs into} Ne5 $15) (19. Be3 Rxc3 $1 20. bxc3 Nxe4 {[%csl
Rc3,Rg3] [%csl Rc3,Rg3]}) 19... Nxe5 20. Bg2 $8 {White has too much loose
stuff on g4 and d4 and potentially h4 if Bxf6.} Bxg2 21. Qxg2 Rxd4 22. Rxd4
Qxd4 23. Qa8+ Kd7 24. Qb7+ $11) 19. Bg2 $16 {Now Black just never gets enough
for his pawn. Perhaps he saw the line with 18..Rc4 19.e5 but was trying to
play for a win?} Rc4 20. Nb3 b4 21. axb4 Rxb4 22. Rf1 Nfd7 23. Be3 (23. Bxe7 $2
Kxe7 {Black's king is completely safe on e7}) 23... Qc7 24. g5 a5 25. h5 $6 (
25. Nb5 $1 Qb8 (25... Qd8 26. Bd2 {wins an exchange}) 26. Ba7 Qc8 27. Rc3 {
Suddenly it is White who is attacking on the queenside!}) 25... a4 26. Na2 Rc4
$6 (26... Rb6 $1 {This incredible resource actually saves Black} 27. Bxb6 Qxb6
28. Nd2 Ba6 29. c4 Rxg5 {and Black is getting some serious compensation for
the exchange. Of course this line is very difficult to see for a human
especially in a critical game like this.}) 27. Nd2 Rxc2 28. Nb4 Rxb2+ $2 (28...
Rc5 {It's surprising why Black play this} 29. g6 (29. Bxc5 $2 Qxc5 {with great
compensation}) 29... fxg6 30. Bh3 {and White sitll has some pressure but Black
is not lost}) 29. Kxb2 $18 {At this point Black is just lost. White just needs
to focus on keeping the king alive.} Qa5 30. Rb1 d5 31. exd5 Bxb4 32. dxe6 Ba6
