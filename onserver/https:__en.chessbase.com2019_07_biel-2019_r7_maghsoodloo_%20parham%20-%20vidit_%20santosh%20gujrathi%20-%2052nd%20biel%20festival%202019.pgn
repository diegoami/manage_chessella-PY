{This game witnessed a very interesting tussle. Considering how Carlsen fights
to the win in every game, I am happy Vidit does the same!} 1. Nf3 (1. e4 c5 2.

e5 5. d3 d5 6. c3 {It is this move that is a fascinating decision (And
probably not best). Normally in the King's Indian you don't play the pawn to
c6, unless you want to take on d4 and make it an open KID.Considering that
Parham allows Black's pawn to d4, I don't find this move useful in the general
sense.} (6. e4 $5 {is immediately possible, and is what I feel is best. The
main point is to keep the queenside knight flexible. e4 is a move we want to
play anyway, so why not immediately? Play can go} d4 (6... dxe4 7. dxe4 Qxd1 8.

better after} 9. Nxe5 Nxe5 10. Bxe4 Bg4 11. Rd5 Nf3+ 12. Kg2 Ne1+ 13. Kh1 $16)

trying to transpose to the Nbd2 lines. Here there are two ways to proceed for
White -} 7. exd5 $5 {is what all the engines want to play, and I find it
understandable - White opens the center while Black is yet to castle. Play can
now go} (7. Nc3 {is what I would prefer - heading into standard Reversed KID
territory.} d4 8. Ne2 O-O 9. Ne1 Ne8 10. f4 f6 11. f5 Nd6 12. g4 Bd7 13. Ng3

Stavanger 2019. Note how the queenside knight got an additional possiblity to
go to a3.}) (6. Nbd2 Be7 7. e4 O-O {and we see a slight problem for White -
any piece move which he makes causes a slight problem in his kingside plans.}
8. a4 $5 {This move has scored well for a lot of reasons, the main one being
that White is refusing to commit in the center and maintains the tension in
the center.} ({Niel Mcdonald mentions in his wonderful book King's Indian
Attack move by move that he doesn't find this move very useful in lieu of} 8.
c3 d4 $1 {and he thus feels the plan is strategically faulty - why should
White weaken himself on the side where Black is stronger?}) 8... Qc7 $5 {
this move seems the most testing - Black continues to maintain the tension and
asks White to commit to something concrete.} 9. exd5 {The best - slow
maneuvering no longer works because Black can get in a quick Rd8 and dxe4.}
Nxd5 10. Nc4 Rd8 11. Re1 f6 12. Nfd2 $1 b6 13. c3 Bf8 14. Qb3 $13 {and here I
prefer White in this complex position - his play seems a bit easier to me, as
Black has to always watch out for tactics along the open a2-g8 diagonal.}) (6.
c4 $5 {is another option, trying to take play into a reversed Benoni. Black
should go} Be7 7. Bg5 (7. cxd5 $5 {is interesting, but not the best in my
opinion. Play can go} Nxd5 8. Nc3 Be6 9. Ne4 f6 10. Bd2 Qd7 11. Rc1 b6 12. a3

the opening. This natural move is incorrect.} ({Playing a la Carlsen with} 8...

reach Movsesian,S (2723)-Carlsen,M (2775) Moscow 2008, here} Nd7 $1 $15 {
gives Black a small advantage.}) 9. Qb3 $6 {Parham's first mistake of the game.
When there are so many theoretical sources available which say allowing d4 is
not great for White, why do you want to do it?} (9. exd5 $1 {is correct, not
allowing Black to seize additional space.} Nxd5 {Play can now go} 10. Nc4 Bf6
11. Re1 (11. Ng5 $5 {is possible, but too peaceful to my liking. After} Bxg5

great.}) 11... h6 12. h3 Nb6 13. Ne3 Be6 14. Ng4 Nd7 15. Nxf6+ Qxf6 16. Be3 $13
{the position is full of pieces and complexity - the better player will win
from here.}) 9... d4 $1 {Vidit now starts to take over - note how the pawn on
c3 is a deterrent to White's kingside plans.} 10. Nc4 Nd7 (10... Qc7 $1 $15 {
is more precise - overprotecting the e5 pawn.}) 11. Bd2 Rb8 12. a4 b6 13. Bh3

dxc3 15. Bxc3 {The computers seem satisfied with Parham's opening play, but I
am not convinced, and feel the other plan with the kingside pawn avalanche is
practically stronger.} Rb7 16. Rcd1 Bf8 {Now if allowed time, Black's space
advantage will tell. It was time for some decisive action.} 17. Rfe1 $6 {
Meaningless move - the e4 pawn will not move anytime soon, so why kill the
rook there?} ({Believe it or not, there is only one way to keep the game in
dynamic balance with} 17. Bxd7 $1 {Trading pieces when low on space is usually
correct.} Bxc4 $5 18. dxc4 Rxd7 19. Rd5 f6 20. Qb5 Qc8 21. Nd2 $11 {and White
has enough control of key squares to maintain the balance.}) 17... Qf6 $15 {
White's pieces are scattered and without purpose.} 18. Bxd7 $6 {The start of a
faulty operation.} (18. Nh4 {was the only way to keep some chances alive, but
Black still takes over after} Nd4 19. Qa2 b5 $1 $15) 18... Rxd7 19. Nfxe5 $2 {
Miscalculation from Parham? I don't blame him - White's position was getting
difficult anyway.} Nxe5 20. Nxe5 Rxe5 $1 21. f4 {Parham was perhaps relying on
this, but must have missed Vidit's next move} Qe6 $1 $19 {White's queen is
hanging, allowing Black to save the rook. The rest is torture for the Iranian
player.} 22. Qc2 Rh5 23. f5 Qc6 24. Be5 Bb7 25. g4 Rh4 26. Qg2 Bd6 27. d4 cxd4

way to end the tournament for Vidit! What a performance!} 0-1
