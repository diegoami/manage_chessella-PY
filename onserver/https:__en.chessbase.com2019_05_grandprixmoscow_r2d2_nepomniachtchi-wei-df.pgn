White must have a more pleasant position}) 11. Ng5 $5 {One of the most
shocking moves in 'modern' opening theory to an impressionable 9-year-old me,
learning chess in 2004!} dxc3 $6 (11... Qxg5 {was obviously tried too, and
with best play Black is committing to a piece sacrifice.} 12. Qf3 O-O-O 13.

following a game Anand-So from Tata Steel 2018.} (11... Bf5 $5 {was my

position type he wanted in Anand,V-So,W Tata Steel Masters 2018, and later
held.}) 12... Nxf6 13. Re1 ({I have also looked at} 13. Nb3 {here but Black
seems to be fine after the principled} Qd6 (13... Bg4 14. Qd3 $32 {was Anton
Guijarro, D-Vidit,S Martuni 2016, where White soon got an advantage, but this
position seems to suit him for stylistic rather than objective reasons.}))

play, but looking at some lines here (including the one that occurred) it
seems Black's disconnected structure means he will face some concrete problems
anyway. As has already been mentioned, these mini-matches encourage very
circumspect decision-making.} Qd7 19. Bg5 Rd8 (19... b4 20. Ne3 bxc3 21. bxc3

weaknesses.}) 20. Ng3 $14 h6 21. Bxf6 Bxf6 22. Nh5 Qf5 23. Nxf6+ Qxf6 24. Qb3 {

present position (since White has bad queenside pawns), but practically
speaking it isn't, because there's not enough of a winning margin there.
Nevertheless, White should try this version, because the pawn trades are
almost inevitable and in the final position after queens come off in this line,
Black will be slightly restricted in terms of space.} Qxb2 (29... Qxe3 30. fxe3

hold this even if he's somehow not in time to fix the pawn structure
favourably (...g6 meets Rd7.)}) 29... d4 30. Qd3 c6 31. b3 Qd6 32. Rc1 Rb8 33.
