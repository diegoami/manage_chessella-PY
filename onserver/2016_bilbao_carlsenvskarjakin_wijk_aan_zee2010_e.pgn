1. e4 e6 $5 {The French Defence. In my younger years I used to consider it at
best a second-rate opening, and I once even lost a bet with one of my friends,
and as a result had to play 1... e6 in all my games with Black in a Super-GM
tournament. Fortunately my friend was greedy, and took money instead. I
believe that both 1...c5 and 1...e5! are better choices, but since I
desperately wanted to win this game (I was trailing the leaders Kramnik and
Shirov by 1 point at this stage) I decided to try something new.} 2. d4 d5 3.
Nc3 Nf6 {The other main move here is 3...Bb4, which is rather more
controversial. Some think it gives Black good counterplay, while others regard
it as a simple positional mistake to give up the bishop too early.} 4. e5 Nfd7
5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 Be7 {Other options here are the relatively slow 7...
a6, or the more concrete 7...cxd4 followed by ...Qb6 or 7...Qb6 immediately,
both of which are rated quite highly by Wesley So and his Rybka (see the
previous issue of NiC).} 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Be2 a6 10. O-O b5 11. Kh1 $5 {An
interesting, quite unusual move. 11.a3 or 11.Nd1 are the most usual moves here.
The text is actually a quite cunning waiting move, as ...b4 and a5-Ba6 (the
normal reply to Nd1) can now be met by Na4, while ...Bb7 (one of several
possible replies to a3) can be met by Nd1. Then Black will probably have to
play ...b4 and a5-Ba6 anyway, but with a tempo less. Therefore I decided to be
more flexible, and make a more or less useful waiting move.} Qc7 12. a3 Bb7 13.
Rad1 Rac8 14. Qe1 {A typical manoeuvre. White intends to gradually start an
attack on the kingside. Therefore I decided to start counterplay in the centre
immediately.} cxd4 15. Nxd4 Nxd4 16. Bxd4 Bc5 17. Qh4 $2 {While this move
might objectively speaking not deserve a question mark, it was definitely a
turning point in the game, as after my reply, Karjakin became very
uncomfortable with his position.} (17. Qf2 {or something similar was required,
as the queen needs to have more influence in the centre after I play ...f6,
which is bound to happen sooner or later.}) 17... Bxd4 18. Rxd4 f6 $1 19. Bd3 {
This one probably doesn't help much either, but since it was part of the plan
with Qh4, I will not attach any mark to it.} h6 20. exf6 (20. Qg4 Qb6 $1 {
would not help White.}) (20. f5 fxe5 21. Rg4 Nf6 {stops any illusions of a
white attack.}) 20... Rxf6 {Now it is clear that something has gone wrong for
White. The rook on d4 is exposed, f4 is weak, and he will be facing tactical
problems with ...e5 quite soon. The "bad" bishop on b7 is certainly no worse
than the white knight, which has dominated it in so many textbook games.} 21.
f5 (21. Rg1 Rcf8 22. Ne2 e5 23. fxe5 Nxe5 {would not have been much of a
relief; the black pieces are just much more active than their white
counterparts here.}) (21. Qg3 Rcf8 22. Rf3 Nb8 $1 {leaves White on brink of
disaster.}) 21... Rcf8 22. Rg1 Nc5 $1 {The most energetic.} ({The tempting} 
22... e5 23. Nxd5 Bxd5 24. Rxd5 Nb6 {trapping the rook, gives White very good
drawing chances after} 25. Qe4 Nxd5 26. Qxd5+ Kh8 27. Re1 {.}) 23. fxe6 Nxe6
24. Rg4 $6 (24. Nxd5 Bxd5 25. Rxd5 Nf4 26. Rd4 Qc5 {forces White to give up
the exchange with Rxf4, as} 27. c3 Nxd3 28. Rxd3 Qxg1+ 29. Kxg1 Rf1# {is mate.
That being said, it would probably have been a better try.}) 24... Nf4 25. Qg3
Qe7 $1 {The last key move, after which Black is completely winning. The point
is to control e2, leaving the white knight without a good square after ...d4
next. The tactical justification, based on a slightly surprising queen sac, is:
} 26. Rxf4 {After this Black will only have to make a couple of more good
moves to win the game, but White was probably lost in any case.} (26. h3 d4 27.
Re1 (27. Ne2 Nxe2 28. Bxe2 Bc8 $1 {wins an exchange, while}) ({nach} 27. Nd1
Bc8 28. Re1 Qf7 29. Rh4 Bb7 30. Rg1 Nxg2 $1 (30... g5 {is also very good of
course}) 31. Rxg2 Rf3 32. Qg4 Re8 {leaves the uncoordinated white forces
defenceless against the threat of ...Re1.}) 27... Qxe1+ $1 28. Qxe1 Nxd3 {
and Black will be material up in every line.}) 26... Rxf4 27. Ne2 (27. Qg6 R8f6
28. Qh7+ Kf7 {is obviously not dangerous.}) 27... Rf1 (27... Rh4 {with the
idea of 28.Qg6 Rxh2+, mating was tempting, but I could not refute the
considerably stronger 28.c3.}) 28. Nd4 {Now Black can force a queen exchange,
but} (28. h3 Rxg1+ 29. Kxg1 Qc5+ 30. Kh2 d4 $1 {finally activating the bishop,
was hardly much stronger.}) 28... Rxg1+ 29. Kxg1 Re8 {With queens on the board
White could perhaps have hoped to resist, but without queens the extra
exchange is bound to count, even though the knight on d4 is holding the
position together for the moment.} 30. h4 Qe1+ 31. Kh2 Qxg3+ 32. Kxg3 Kf7 33.
Kf2 Kf6 34. g3 Bc8 35. c3 Bg4 36. Bc2 g5 37. hxg5+ hxg5 38. Bb3 Ke5 39. Bc2
Rf8+ 40. Kg2 Bd7 41. Nf3+ Kf6 42. Bb3 g4 43. Nd4 Ke5 {Now the white king is
cut off, and the undermining a5+b4 cannot be prevented.} 44. Bc2 a5 45. Bd1 Ke4
{My best game in Corus 2010!} 0-1
