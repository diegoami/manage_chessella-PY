{The USA team arrived at the last round of the 2016 Chess Olympiad as the
leader, edging Ukraine thanks to their better tie-break. In this crucial final
round, we watched a North American derby between the US and the surprisingly
strong Canadian team. With Kovalyov and Hansen scoring in every other game, the
Canadians reached 4th place after the penultimate round. Being ahead just by a
whisker in tie-break, a victory in this match was direly needed by the US
squad. With the team's "big three" guns culminating victories one after other,
we just had to sit and wait for one of them to score. This time, it was Caruana
and So who delivered the victory. So's victory came in a topsy-turvy game.} 1.

for an "English".} c5  2. Nf3  Nc6  3. Nc3  g6 $6 {(03:00) There is nothing
wrong with this move. However, Black usually does not combine it with Nc6 due
to White's next move.} 4. e3 $1 {(00:10) Now the game enters a form of "Panov
attack", in the Caro-Kann defense!} Nf6  5. d4  cxd4  6. exd4  d5  7. Bg5  (7.

the most popular ways to play this opening. Wesley goes for more complications
to keep the game more unbalanced and more difficult for his 'out of retirement'
GM opponent.}) 7... Be6  8. Bxf6  exf6  9. h3 $146 {(00:04) I could not believe
my eyes but this move is a novelty according to the ChessBase Online database.

already become too critical for Black.} Qb8  (17... Ra2 18. Qc1 Qb8 { looks

resourceful, but this move throws away everything. A series of miraculous moves
would have saved him.} (26... Qe2 27. Nxf7+ Kg7 28. Ne5 Kh8 $3 {Only a machine

cannot improve even though Black's weakened king offers potential 'time

probably missed the check on a1.} 35. fxe3  Qg3  36. Qa1+ {(00:10) And it is
Black who gets mated not white! And US team wins the Olympiad after four
