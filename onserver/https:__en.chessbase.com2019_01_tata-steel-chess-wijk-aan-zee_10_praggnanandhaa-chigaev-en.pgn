creative defence.} 37. Rxa6 h3 {The point of the previous move: Black wants to clear a path for his central pawns and
provokes:} 38. g3 $2 {Just before the time control Praggnanandhaa loses the big picture. The fact is Black's h-pawn is
more dangerous than his e and f-pawns.} ({After} 38. gxh3 {White retains good winning chances.} ) Bg5 {Preparing a
treacherous tactical trick.} 39. Ra5 Rd2+ $3 {An unpleasant surprise for White.} 40. Kxd2 fxg3+ 41. Kd3 gxh2 {The black
h-pawn seems to be queening, but White also has a trick up his sleeve:} 42. Rxe5+ $1 Kxe5 43. Bg3+ Bf4 44. Bxh2 Bxh2
{Black has an extra bishop, but it's of the "wrong" colour. If the white king gets to h1, the position is a draw. But
White, perhaps flummoxed by the sudden turn of events does not find the path to a draw.} 45. Ke3 $2 {Now White, under
pressure commits a losing error.} ({After} 45. Ke2 $1 {White can save himself because when the black bishop moves away
from h2, the white king arrives at h1. But White also threatens 46.Kf3 together with 47.Kg4 to seize the h-pawn. And so Black cannot win.} )Bg3 46. Kf3 Be1 { Now the white king is frozen or else the h-pawn
queens. But on the queenside white will soon run out of pawn moves.} 47. a4 Kd5 48. a5 Kc5 49. b3 Kb5 50. b4 Bh4 51. c4+
Ka6 {White gave up. After 52.c5 Kb5 White is in Zugzwang. A bitter defeat for the young Indian and
a lucky win for Chigaev, who was able to maintain his lead.} 0-1
