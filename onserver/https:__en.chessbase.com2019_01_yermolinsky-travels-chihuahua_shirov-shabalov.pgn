1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Ba5 {For this principled battle,
Shabalov prepared the sideline of the Winawer long favored by Armenian players.
} 6. Qg4 {Normally this move isn't played rightaway.} (6. b4 cxd4 7. Qg4 {
is main line.}) 6... Kf8 $6 {Shabalov mixed up his lines.} (6... Ne7 7. dxc5
Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 {and now Black chooses between} O-O (8... Ng6) ({or} 8... Qa5))
7. dxc5 $1 {Accepting triple pawns was Spassky's favorite idea in such
positions. Here it's further justified by the uncastled black king.} Bxc3+ 8.
bxc3 Nd7 9. Nf3 Ne7 10. c4 $1 {Energetic, as expected.} Qc7 {Black's only
counterplay is to attack the e5-pawn.} 11. cxd5 Nxd5 12. c4 Nxe5 13. Qg3 {[#]}
Nxf3+ 14. gxf3 Qxc5 $6 {Knowing Shabba as well as I do after the 30 years of
playing together, I knew he is always going to pick up the gauntlet, however
suicidal it might be.} ({A more sober decision would be to suffer in the
endgame after} 14... Qxg3 15. hxg3 Ne7 16. Rb1 f6 17. Bd3 Kf7 {Not Shabba's
style for sure.}) 15. Bd2 Ne7 16. Bb4 Qc6 17. Rd1 Bd7 18. Rg1 Rg8 19. Bd3 f5 $2
({The players post-mortem revolved around} 19... a5 20. Be4 ({Shirov preferred
} 20. Bd6 f5 21. Be2 $18) 20... Qxc4 21. Bxe7+ Kxe7 22. Qd6+ Kf6 23. Qd2 (23.
Qxd7 Rad8) 23... g5 24. Bxh7 Bc6 25. Bxg8 Rxg8 {where Black can and will fight
on.}) 20. Be4 {Suddenly it's curtains.} (20. Be4 fxe4 21. Qg5 Re8 22. Qf4#) 1-0
