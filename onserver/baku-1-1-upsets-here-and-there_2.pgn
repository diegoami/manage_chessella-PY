20. g4 {A very weird position. Black's kingside has been annihilated, White
hasn't developed his f1 bishop but has a passed pawn on h4... Black needs to
create somethig on the queenside, but it seems as if everything falls short.}
Qa5 21. Nb3 $1 Bxb3 22. axb3 Rf6 23. Qg2 $1 {The best placement of the queen.
It can now eye the a8 square and give potentially annoying checks.} d5 24. Bd3
Nc6 $6 {It's hard to recommend something, and trading on d3 is undesirable, but
this almost loses on the spot.} 25. c3 (25. g5 $1 Rd6 26. Qf2 d4 27. c3 $1 {is
a beautiful trick, following up with b4.}) 25... b4 26. g5 $1 Rd6 27. c4 $1
{White's position advantage is very clear. His king is surprisingly safe on b1,
while Black will have to deal with his own problems for his majesty and deal
with the passed pawns on the kingside.} dxc4 28. Bxc4 Ne5 (28... Rxc4 29. bxc4
Nd4 {was more challenging. Black is threatening b3 with some ideas of
counterplay and White would have had to find} 30. Rxd4 $1 Rxd4 31. Qa8+ Qd8 32.
Qxd8+ Rxd8 33. h5 $16 {with what should be a winning endgame.}) 29. Rxd6 exd6 {
The attack simply plays itself out for White now} 30. Qa8+ (30. Qe4 $1) 30...
Qd8 31. Qe4 Qe7 32. Re1 Kd8 33. Qa8+ Rc8 34. Qxa6 Qd7 35. Qb6+ Ke7 36. Qf2 Kd8
37. Qb6+ Rc7 38. Bb5 $1 Qf5+ 39. Ka2 Kc8 40. Qxd6 {White is up two pawns and
has a crushing attack.} Nc6 41. Ba6+ 1-0
