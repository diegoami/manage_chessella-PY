{It was my 4th game in the tournament against player from Germany. The
previous result (0.5/3) was not presentable for me so I was in quite agressive
mood} 10... Nd5 $6 {The first step in wrong direction} ({After solid} 10...
Nbd7 {The game only begins}) 11. Nxd5 exd5 $6 {The second one. Now B on b7 is
quite passive and f5-square is free for the knight} 12. Ng3 {Of course white
concentrates pieces near the opponent's king} g6 $6 {The third} 13. h4 Bxh4 $2
{Looks like a suicide} ({According the famous rule "to hit in centre after
moving on the side" black should proceed} 13... c5 $1 {But after simple} 14. h5
Bf6 15. hxg6 fxg6 16. Nf5 $40 {White's attack looks very promissing}) 14. Nf5
$1 $40 {Now it's winning.} Bg5 ({After capturing} 14... gxf5 15. Qxf5 {All of
white piece's are taking part in black's king execution}) 15. Qg3 Bxf4+ ({
Unfortunately,} 15... f6 {is also not helping} 16. Bxg5 fxg5 17. Nh6+ Kg7 18.
Qe5+ $18) 16. Qxf4 f6 17. Rxh7 {Simple and strong} Rf7 18. Rh1 $1 {The only
tough move to find} gxf5 19. Qh6 Rd7 20. Re1 Nc6 21. Re6 $2 {Here I missed a
nice trick} (21. Qh8+ Kf7 22. Rh7+ Kg6 23. Rh6+ Kf7 (23... Kg5 24. f4+ Kxf4 25.
Rh4+ Kg3 26. Qh6) 24. Re8 $3 {Wins immediately}) 21... Kf7 {To be honest, I
missed this move, but the position still winning.} 22. Re3 Qg8 23. Qh7+ Qg7 24.
Qxf5 Re7 25. Rh7 {Black resigned on the move 43th} 1-0
