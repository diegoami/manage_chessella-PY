{I'm usually a bit shy to show my own 'masterpieces', but in Skopje I
particularly enjoyed my game in round seven, where I won with my beloved King's
Indian! It happened that on the 5th of April, when round seven was played, my
husband and my father were celebrating their birthdays, as they are both born
on the same date. Perhaps I tried to bring them a chess present from afar?!}
13... Bf6 14. b4 Bh4 15. Be1 Bxe1 16. Qxe1 g5 {Having gotten rid of the bad
bishop is a big achievement for Black. Now some typical regrouping starts,
White will be making progress on the queenside, Black will be trying to do the
same on the kingside.} 17. c5 Nf6 18. b5 h5 19. h3 Kg7 {Making way for the
rook. It's all about the h-file!} 20. c6 bxc6 21. bxc6 hxg4 22. hxg4 Rh8 23.
Kg2 Ng6 24. Rh1 Nh4+ 25. Kf2 a5 $1 ({I was very happy with this move. Next is
Ba6, followed by the annoying queen maneouver Qb8-a7. Note that} 25... Ba6 {is
not working well because of} 26. Nxf4 $1) 26. Rb1 {Stopping my queen from
coming to a7.} Ba6 27. Nc1 $6 ({Although optically I like Black's position, I
haven't found a convincing plan against} 27. a4 {followed by Nb5.}) 27... Qc8
$1 {setting up a whole range of tactical ideas.} 28. Qf1 (28. Bxa6 Qxa6
{followed by Qa7+ is just lost, so is}) (28. a4 Bxe2 29. Qxe2 (29. N1xe2 Nxf3
$1) 29... Nf5 $3 (29... Nxf3 $5) 30. Rxh8 Qxh8 31. exf5 (31. gxf5 Qh4+ 32. Kf1

Nxe4+ 36. fxe4 Rh2+ 37. Ke1 Qxe4+ {with a mating attack. Finding this is quite
a challenge though!}) 28... Nxf3 $1 {Now it all collapses.} 29. Bxa6 Rxa6 $6
{Trying to save time, I quickly played what I calculated beforehand and assesed
as being much better for Black. I should have thought just 30 seconds
longer...} (29... Qxg4 {was much stronger!}) 30. Rb7 ({And here} 30. Rxh8 Kxh8
31. Qh3+ {was a better defence, though Black should slowly win after} Nh4)
30... Rh2+ $1 31. Rxh2 Nxg4+ {some nicely dancing knights!} 32. Ke2 Nfxh2 33.
Qh3 f3+ 34. Kd2 f2 35. Nb5 f1=Q {White resigned.} 0-1
