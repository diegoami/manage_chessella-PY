{Quite often in chess tournaments we notice quick draws in order to secure a
certain prize or save the energy for the next rounds. In Lund though, the
clash between the first and the second place contenders was anything but an
anticlimax. The moment I appreciated most was:} 22. Nxb7 $1 {Pretty positional
sacrifice, fully justified by the number of pawns got in return. The Russian
GM is known for his calculation abilities and I wouldn't be surprised if he
saw everything until the very end.} Nxb7 ({Obviously not} 22... Qxb7 23. Bxa6 {
[%cal Ga6c8]}) 23. Bxf5 ({White could have grabbed the other guy on a6 but
according to my faithful machine Volkov's choice is practically superior,
demanding higher accuracy and alertness from Black. In case of} 23. Bxa6 Nb8
24. Rxc8 Rxc8 25. dxe5 Nxa6 26. Qxa6 Qxe5 27. Qxb7 Qxe3+ 28. Kh1 Rc1 {and a
draw would be the most likely result.}) 23... Rc7 24. Qxa6 {three pawns for
the piece but the Swedish GM has quite some weapons up his sleeves:} Nd6 25.
Rxc6 Nxf5 26. Rxc7 Qxc7 27. Qe6 exd4 28. exd4 Qc4 29. Qe5+ {What can one do?
With correct play from both sides a draw cannot really be avoided. However,
the way this game went is far from flavorless!} Kg8 30. a4 Qxd4+ 31. Qxd4 Nxd4

Kd3 Rf7 41. Kc4 Ng4 42. Kxb4 Nxe3 43. fxe3 {So here it is: Black is a rook up
but White is counting on his pawns' army. You can have some fun analyzing this
because my computer is currently giving 0.00 at depth 30:))) Reaching an
objective conclusion of this position would cost me some hours of sleep but
please give it a try if you have the energy! I find these unbalanced games so
so difficult to play, as they leave plenty of room for mistakes on both sides.
It was the case in this encounter as well but its beauty remains.} Rf5 44. Kb5
