1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Nbd7 {Such is Anand's
faith on his opening, he tried it against Aronian, then against Giri and
now once again against Topalov. That's the thing with Anand: once he believes
in his opening preparation he is not afraid of his opponents' novelties.}
5. Qc2 {Topalov made this move that was played by Giri as well. He got
up from his chair and Anand replied instantly.} Bb4 6. cxd5 (6. a3 {was
Anish's choice.}) 6... exd5 7. a3 Bxc3+ 8. Qxc3 Ne4 9. Qc2 {Until now
players are following the game between Sakaev and Eljanov from Dagomys
2009. But now Anand deviates.} O-O 10. e3 Re8 11. b3 $5 {[%cal Gb2b3]
This doesn't seem to be too ambitious. After that Black can equalize without
too many difficulties.} (11. b4 {If you wanted to develop the bishop on
b2 then why not b4? Well then the b4 pawn could become a weakness after}
a5 12. Bb2 axb4 13. axb4 Rxa1+ 14. Bxa1 Qe7 $15) 11... c6 12. Bd3 Nf8
13. Bb2 Bf5 14. O-O (14. Nd2 Qg5 $15) 14... Qf6 15. Ne5 Nd6 { By exchanging
the light squared bishops, Vishy is mainly aiming for a position where
he would have a knight against the b2 bishop. That would give Black an
excellent position.} 16. Rae1 Bxd3 17. Nxd3 Qg6 18. f3 $5 {The thing about
Topalov is that he always likes to play actively. Here he is looking for
the right moment when he can break in the centre with e4 and at the same
time takes that square away from the d6 knight.} f6 19. a4 Ne6 20. Qd2
(20. Ba3 Nf5) 20... h5 $5 {In some ways securing the f5 square for the
knight.} 21. Ba3 Nf5 22. Nf4 $6 {[%cal Gd3f4] This move is completely
illogical. White exchanges the knights and leaves himself with some weaknesses.
Why would White want to defend an inferior endgame voluntarily from an
equal position?} Nxf4 23. exf4 { The resulting position looks mildly in
Black's favour. The main reason being that the knight is better than the
bishop and Black's pawn structure is better than White's.} Rxe1 (23...
h4 $1 {Securing the f5 knight was also possible.}) 24. Rxe1 Re8 25. Rxe8+
Qxe8 26. Kf2 {Anand has those micro edges and he has the right to press
in this position.} Nh6 27. Qd3 b6 {This is a very responsible decision.
On one hand Black is weakening the c6 pawn but on the other he is preventing
the move a5 followed by Bc5 which would paralyse his queenside majority.
It is always a tradeoff and Vishy chose the move b6. Turns out that the
c6 pawn was the reason why he couldn't really make much progress. What
would have happened if Vishy would not have played b6 is a completely
different story.} 28. Bb4 Qe6 29. Qc2 Kf7 30. Ba3 Qd7 31. Bb4 Nf5 32.
Qd3 g6 33. g3 Ng7 {White doesn't have too many active possibilities. Black
on the other hand can try to use his queenside majority by having the
knight on e6 at some point. Right now it doesn't seem possible because
Ne6 is met with f4-f5, but can Black prepare it is the question.} 34.
Qe3 Kg8 (34... h4 35. g4 $11) ( 34... Qe6 {might have been the best move.}
35. Qxe6+ (35. Qc3 h4 $17 36. g4 f5 37. g5 Qd7 {and the position has changed
in Black's favour.}) 35... Nxe6 36. Ke3 c5 37. dxc5 bxc5 38. Ba3 f5 $15)
(34... Ne6) 35. Qd3 Kh7 36. Kg2 Qf5 37. Qc3 (37. Qxf5 Nxf5 {would definitely
be some progress for Black.}) 37... Qe6 ( 37... Qb1 {was possible, but
as Vishy said in the press conference with three moves to go until the
time control he didn't want to let things spiral out of control. In any
case it was just a draw.} 38. Qxc6 Qb2+ 39. Kh3 Qxb3 40. Bf8 Qxf3 41.

40. Qc3 Qe6 41. Qd3 Qf5 42. Qc3 h4 {Vishy shuns the draw and tries to
play for a win.} 43. g4 Qb1 {The queen has made her way into the enemy
camp, but without the knight she cannot do much.} 44. Be3 (44. Qxc6 Qd3
$19 {The bishop on d2 will drop.}) 44... Qd1 45. Bf2 Qe2 46. Qe3 Qxe3
47. Bxe3 Ne6 48. Kh3 g5 49. f5 $1 ( 49. fxg5 fxg5 {might be a tad better
for Black, although a draw here looks most likely.}) 49... Nf4+ (49...

to a draw.} (51. Kxh4 $2 c5 52. dxc5 bxc5 53. Kh3 c4 $19) 1/2-1/2
