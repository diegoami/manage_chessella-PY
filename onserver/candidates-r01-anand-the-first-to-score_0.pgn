1. Nf3 {Sergey usually begins with 1.e4 but every now and then you see him
opening with his king's knight. So it wasn't such a huge surprise for Svidler.}
d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 c6 {Svidler is known all over the chess world for his
Grunfeld. But there was a brief period betwee 2007 to 2009 where he played the
Slav Defense. In the first round he prefers to stay solid.} 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. a4
e6 $5 {This is considered a tad passive as Black transposes the game into
Queen Gambit Accepted territory. Especially because the move c5 will come with
a loss of of tempo (c7-c6-c5). But Black would like to say that the way White
has made use of his extra tempo is not particularly the best by playing a2-a4.}
(5... Bf5 {is surely the main line when the theory runs into pages.}) 6. e3 (6.
e4 Bb4 7. e5 Nd5 8. Bd2 b5 9. axb5 Bxc3 10. bxc3 cxb5 11. Ng5 {is the sharp
tactical line which Svidler looked at great depth before the game.}) 6... c5 7.
Bxc4 Nc6 8. O-O cxd4 9. Nxd4 $5 {As Svidler said after the round, " Sergey is
used to doing this everytime against me. I prepare all the lines against him
and he comes up with a move that I haven't looked at in the morning prior to
the game! Although this move might not be as popular as 9.exd4 it is not
without venom. Basically if Black would take on d4 then after exd4 White gets
nice initiative after exd4 threatening the d5 break. On the other hand if you
don't take on d4 then you are able to fully unwind.} Bd7 {Peter made this move
quickly. Even though he hadn't seen this line, he remembered that Bd7 was the
main move. That was where his theoretical knowledge ended, but it was
important for him to bluff to his opponent that he was well prepared. You can
see how off the board psychology plays an important role in the games of these
top players.} (9... Nxd4 10. exd4 {If Black was able to get in Bd7-c6 here he
would be completely fine. But he is a long way off and White has shown that he
is better in this line.} Be7 11. d5 $1 exd5 12. Nxd5 Nxd5 13. Bxd5 O-O 14. Be3
$14 {And this symmetrical structured position is simply torture for Black.
There is simple no easy way to neutralize White's forces.}) 10. Nf3 $5 {
A nice piece of prophylactic thinking. Black wanted to take on d4 and follow
it up with Bc6, so White simply retreated his knight.} a6 {Although this
wastes time it secures an excellent c7 square for the white queen.} 11. e4 Qc7
{Ng4 followed by Ne5 is one of the common ideas in this position, so Karjakin
prevents it with his next move.} 12. h3 Bd6 13. Qe2 O-O 14. Bd3 (14. Bg5 {
is another option for White but after} Ne5 15. Bxf6 gxf6 16. Bb3 Rfd8 {
followed by Rac8, the double pawns on the kingside don't really affect Black
where as the bishop pair might become an extrmely potent force.}) 14... Ne5 15.
Nxe5 Bxe5 16. f4 $1 Bd4+ (16... Bxc3 17. bxc3 Qxc3 {is liked by the engines
but Svidler didn't even consider this move for a second. After} 18. Bb2 $44 {
White has bucket loads of compensation for the pawn in the form of an
extremely strong dark squared bishop.}) 17. Be3 Bxe3+ 18. Qxe3 {This might be
a good positional exercise for everyone who might want to learn about good
bishops and bad bishops and prophylactic thinking. Currently the bishop on d3
is not so great. It is shouting for the e-pawn to move ahead and open up the
b1-h7 diagonal. However, Svidler has nothing of that. He just shuts off
everything with this next fine move.} e5 $1 {Diagram [#]} (18... Bc6 {is not
bad but it is not in the spirit of the position.} 19. e5 Nd5 20. Nxd5 Bxd5 $11
{Black is not worse but White is also doing fine.}) 19. Rac1 (19. fxe5 Qxe5 $15
{The e-pawn is isolated and the bishop is coming next to c6, this is quite a
depressing and one-sided position in Black's favour.}) 19... exf4 20. Qxf4 Qxf4
{Although Black had an option to stay in the middlegame with Qc5+, once
Svidler saw that he could transpose the game into a slightly favourable
endgame he didn't hesitate.} 21. Rxf4 Be6 22. Kf2 {This thematic move which
could have been a text-book example of activating your king in the late
middlegame/ early endgame is double edged. The king can be well placed on e3
or it may become a target for some small tactical tricks.} Rac8 23. Ke3 Nd7 {
Svidler's play is natural and there might not be such a great point in going
into the details of whether Rfd8 was more accurate before Nd7 or Rfe8 before
the knight move. As things stand Black has a slightly better game but Sergey
has things under control.} 24. Rff1 Rfe8 25. Be2 Nb6 (25... Rc6 {Followed by
doubling of the rooks on the c-file, followed by Nc5, looks like an
interesting idea.}) 26. Rcd1 Nc4+ 27. Bxc4 Rxc4 28. Rf2 Kf8 29. Rd4 Rxd4 30.
Kxd4 Rc8 {The position is completely equal after subsequent Nd5 and the
players agreed to a draw. It can be said that the game was a success for
Svidler as with the black pieces he was able to put substantial pressure on
his country mate.} 1/2-1/2
