Qb1 Re7 {Upon looking at this position, one cannot help but feel there must be
'something' here for White. After all, Black as a bad bishop, a weak pawn on
b4, a vulnerable king to the g-file, and of course White has two rooks aimed
in the right direction. Although the two players drew only three moves later,
Tomashevsky missed a chance to capitalize on his position.} {[%tqu "En","White

move might seem counterintuitive as it effectively imprisons White's bishop on
g6 (short of sacrificing it that is), but it is ok. It serves to both control
e6, and the bishop also attacks e8, making a rook double-up on the e-file
nearly impossible.  White's plan is quite simple: prepare a timely e4 break.
Black will be hard pressed to prevent it.} Rf8 (47... Bc8 48. Qf1 Ra8 49. Qe1
