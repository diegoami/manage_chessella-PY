{One of those games that could have been preparation until almost any moment
whatsoever- especially considering the pedigree of David Navara (think Kh8!)
when it comes to this.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 c6 5. e3 Nbd7 6.

and} 10. d5 {is basically even. That being said, concensus seems to be that
the dangers of an isolated e-pawn have been overstated, and Black need not
worry about} c4 (10... exd5 11. e5 Nxe5 12. Nxe5 Bd6 13. Nf3 $14 {isn't a very

White has more than adequate compensation, but Black should play like this if
he wants to win.}) (11... Bb4+ 12. Bd2 Bxd2+ 13. Qxd2 axb5 14. exf6 Qxf6 15.

the line} 11... Ng4 12. Qa4 Ngxe5 13. Nxe5 Nxe5 14. Nd6+ Ke7 15. Nxc8+ Rxc8 16.

explain the missing pawn.}) (12... Bb7 $5 {To my mind this is a valid
alternative.} 13. fxg7 $5 (13. O-O Qxf6 $1 {Now Black can take this without

continuing tactical issues which are difficult to find your way through.}) 18.

decision several moves later after a sequence of forcing moves.} ({If Black
suspected that this could still have been preparation- it's reasonable that
White could have something in mind against ...h5- he might have held back and
played} 20... Qc6 $1 {, where usually he ends up taking a rook for two pieces

reasonable winning chances after either move, but after the text there is no
prospect of a simple fortress.} ({It is very far from being immediately
obvious that Black saves his piece after} 32... Kd6 $5 {but in fact White
shouldn't even try and take it.} 33. h4 $1 {Now Black has to seek salvation in
fortresses.} (33. f4 exf4 34. gxf4 Kc5 $1 35. Ra4 (35. fxg5 Kxb4 36. Kxd2 fxg5

is really whether he can assemble some kind of fortress before then. It turns
out, unsurprisingly, that he can, and that it's easier with a bishop than a
knight:} f5 42. gxf5 f6 43. Ke3 Nxh7 44. Rxh7 Ke5 45. Rh8 Bc5+ 46. Ke2 Bd6 $11)
