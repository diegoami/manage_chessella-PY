{It is never easy to play against a very good friend they say, especially if
you dislike agreeing for a draw. I would actually subscribe, as I don't have
the best memories ever after having faced my own husband on the chess board...
Mark and Simon are good buddies as you probably know but had no problems to
sharpen their knives in their encounter and still hang around together after
that!} 1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 f5 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 g6 5. O-O Bg7 6. c4 O-O 7. Nc3 d6 8.

Qf6 15. exf5 Bxf5 16. Qb3 Bg4 {Critical moment, when White must decide which
route is the best way to compensation and initiative.} 17. Rd3 {Not the best
choice, after which Black firmly took over.} ({Better was} 17. Nd2 Bxd1 18.
Qxb7 Ba4 19. Bd5+ Kh8 20. Ne4 Qd8 21. Qa6 {with a messy position but I would
take White.}) 17... e4 18. Rde3 Bh6 19. Nd4 ({Obviously} 19. R3e2 {runs into}

Ng4 24. c5+ Kh8 25. Qxb7 {What else?! Tongue in cheek, Mark was commenting on
his decision to go for an unhealthy walk with the king: "Didn't see the mate,
so... why not?":)} Qf2+ 26. Kh3 Qxh2+ 27. Kxg4 Qh5+ 28. Kf4 g5+ 29. Kf5 g4+ 30.
Kf4 {I remember we were sharking around the top board, trying to figure out
where is the mate?! Simon did the same but didn't manage to figure it out nor
did we. Of course computers are laughing in our faces in these type of
situations...} Qe5+ {is of course not spoiling anything but delivering mate is
somewhat a nicer way to finish for a chess player.} ({During the game I was
calculating} 30... h6 31. Ne6 Qf7+ 32. Kxg4 Rg8+ 33. Kh3 {when I thought
hummmm, cannot see the mate! But there is one after} Rxg3+ 34. Kxg3 Rg8+ { and
0-1 next move.}) 31. Kxg4 Rg8+ 32. Kf3 Rab8 33. Qxb8 Qxg3+ 34. Ke2 Qg2+ 35. Kd3

Kd4 Rd8+ {Game is over, scoresheets are signed, time for some social
activities. I respect so much the players that succeed to think "it's only a
bad game if you react badly to it; don't beat yourself up and just accept the
facts". If only it would be that easy...it never is. But Mark not only papered
over a less fortunate game but also bounced back stronger. See his win with
Black against the tournament's top seed!} 0-1
