{Black is a pawn up and has better chances, but his pawn on b7 is backward and
weak. People say that the Chinese players are tactically very strong. What does
it mean to be tactically alert? According to me it is the awareness of all the
little changes that are taking place in the position. Here White's last move
was Kd4-e5, which meant that the c-pawn is now pinned. Lu Shanglei's next move
is an unusual theme, but very nice and logical.} 41... b5 $1 {The c-pawn is
pinned and hence there is no en passant! I am trying to remember when I saw
such a theme before and I have to say I am unable to recollect it. Hence, this
is a rare theme. After this Black is in the driver's seat and went on to win
the game.} 42. Nd3 Ra4 43. Kd6 f6 44. Nf4 a5 45. Ne6+ Kg6 46. Nd4 Rxd4+ 47.
