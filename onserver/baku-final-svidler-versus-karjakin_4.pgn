1. Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 e6 4. O-O Be7 5. d3 c5 {Of the
nearly 900 games that have reached this position 820 games have continued
with Nbd2. But Svidler has seen worked out the imperceptible difference
between these two moves and come to the conclusion that this is not accurate.}
(5... O-O {is more accurate and in order to get in e4 White will have
to play Nbd2. To Sergey's credit he learnt from this mistake and in their
next encounter in Russian Team Championship he went 5...0-0.}) 6. e4 $1

Gc1f4] With excellent compensation was the deep point behind Peter's opening
play.}) 7. Qe2 {White is able to do without the move Nbd2 which is an
opening victory for the first player. He can later play e5 and get his
bishop out to f4 without having to engage in tedious manoeuvres like Re1,
Nd2-f1 and then Bf4. Svidler got an excellent position from the openng
but later lost the game.} 0-1
