Nc6 9. g4 {Both players said afterwards this was not really an opening they
had studied in great detail. Caruana wanted to try and surprise his opponent a
little.} Nd7 10. g5 g6 {Both players liked this move as it now brings about
the threat of h6 for black. If Immediately h6 then white could then play g6
himself.} 11. Bc4 Nxd4 12. Qxd4 e5 13. Qd5 O-O 14. Bb3 exf4 15. Bxf4 Ne5 16. h4
{Caruana has gained the square d5 for his pieces and his bishop on b3 is
extremely strong. If he had tiem to castle queenside then his position would
be clearly better but he has to give up this right but believes in his long
term advantages.} Nf3+ 17. Kf2 Ne5 18. Rad1 Bg4 {A good decision by Grandelius
trying to keep the position complicated and double edged.} {[%tqu "En","The
best and most practical move in the position. You need to exchange off one of
blacks most dangerous pieces and gain soem trumps of your own! Can you make
the hard choice?","","","d5b7","An excellent practical choice by Caruana, for
the exchange he gains some much needed central control and the d5 square.",10]}
