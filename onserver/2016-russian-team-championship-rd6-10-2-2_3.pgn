Rd8 9. d4 cxd4 10. cxd4 d5 11. e5 Ne4 12. Nc3 Nxe5 $5 {This move, though
attractive, only offers equality via repetition. In theory.} 13. Nxe5 Bxe5 14.
dxe5 Qxf2+ 15. Kh2 Qg3+ 16. Kg1 Qf2+ 17. Kh2 Qg3+ 18. Kg1 {White doesn't really
have any choice so a draw seems reasonable, except that Black suddenly decides
she wants more.} Nf2 {This is one of those do-or-dare situations where White
needs to stay calm, look carefully, and find the refutation. (drum roll)} 19.
Qf3 $2 {Admittedly the correct move did not stand out as the obvious choice,
but this move is bad and rewards Black for the risk she took.} (19. Ne4 $3 {It
is a bit counterintuitive, but with the rook undefended on d8, nor was it
impossible to see. The key of course is to see the rest of the main line.}
Nxh3+ 20. Kh1 Qh4 (20... Nf2+ 21. Nxf2 Qxf2 {and Black is just down a piece.})
21. g3 Nf2+ {double-check.} 22. Kg1 Qxe4 23. Kxf2 {and Black is still down a
piece, but the exposed white king, extra pawns that can come rolling down the
kingside, and even passed d-pawn, promise some counterchances.}) 19... Nxh3+
