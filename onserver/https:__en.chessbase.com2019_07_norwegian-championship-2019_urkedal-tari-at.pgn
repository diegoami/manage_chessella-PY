which might be the reason my opponent decided to play like this.} Rd8 (10...

should be a bit better. 1-0 (58) Carlsen,M (2875)-Mamedyarov,S (2774)
Stavanger 2019}) 11. d5 e6 12. Bg5 f6 13. Be3 Nc6 14. Bd3 Ne7 {Very unusual
move, but has gained some popularity in recent years. Ivan Salgado was one of
the first who played this line, actually against me in the Turkish League 3
years ago and equalized quite easily. I decided to have a look at it from the
Black side.} (14... exd5 15. exd5 c4 {This used to be popular, until Leko won
a very nice game against Topalov in 2011.} 16. Bxc4 Be6 17. Rd1 Ne7 18. dxe6

piece, but has a very powerful pawn on e6. White went on to win a nice game in
1-0 (41) Leko,P (2720)-Topalov,V (2768) Porto Carras 2011}) 15. c4 {The only
move that makes sense. Otherwise the centre falls.} Qxd2+ 16. Nxd2 (16. Bxd2 {
is also possible, as played by Yu Yangyi against Svidler twice last year.} b6

before, so it was kind of preparation. I believe that Black should be fine in
this endgame. It could seem a bit strange to play like this for Black, and I
was also a bit surprised when Salgado did it against me. White has more space
and it looks like he should be better, but it is not easy at all. Black has
some deep ideas in this position. White has to always take care of some f5-g5
stuff. Also it is not that easy for White to find a plan.} 17. Be2 $6 {Seemed
a bit strange to me. I'm not sure why the bishop should be better placed on e2
than d3.} (17. Ke2) (17. O-O {seems like a more logical move. In the game
White did this anyway but with the bishop on e2.}) 17... Re8 (17... f5 $1 {
is usually always a good move when it is possible. Black opens up for his
bishop and there are no drawbacks by doing that.} 18. f3 Re8 {[%csl Gg7][%cal
Ge8e1] With such a strong bishop on g7, Black definetly has a good game. It is
still not clear to me how White should come up with a plan here, while Black's
moves are easier.}) 18. O-O Bd7 (18... f5 {is again possible. I thought I
should develop and get ready before playing this, but Black is ready.} 19. Bf3

with this move. Black is preparing g5, taking more space on the kingside, and
creating a square for my knight on g6.} (20... exd5 21. cxd5 Nxd5 $4 {would
obviously be a huge blunder, as after} 22. Bc4 $18 {Black drops a piece.}) 21.
h4 {A good move, which stops my idea. But at the same time I was happy with my
position out of the opening. With a monster bishop on g7, I believe that
Black's play is again easier here.} Kh7 {Improving the king and threatening to
win a pawn with exd5-Nxd5, which explains my opponent's next move.} 22. Bf2 Be5
{Taking control of the dark squares, and stopping White from potentially
playing f3-f4.} (22... f4 {was also interesting to me, taking full control of
the dark squares.}) 23. g3 {A good move as, if I play f5-f4, then g3 would not
be possible.} f4 24. Kg2 Nc8 {The knight is better placed on d6 than e7, so
this seemed logical to me.} 25. Bd3 Nd6 26. Re2 $2 {The rook is not well
placed here.} (26. gxf4 $1 Bxf4 27. Be3 {Challenging Black on the dark squares.
This would be very clever, as the position could also be double-edged now.
Black is forced to take, otherwise f3-f4 would come.} Bxe3 28. Rxe3 e5 {
what I was counting on, but still} 29. f4 $1 exf4 30. Rf3 {[%cal Gf3f4] White
also gets play now, and is more active than in the game.}) 26... g5 $1 $15 {
Securing the "monster" bishop on e5. I was getting more and more happy from
here. White is just quite passive without a good plan here, while the Black
pieces are better than White's.} 27. hxg5 hxg5 28. Nf1 Kg7 29. Nh2 exd5 30.
exd5 {Forced.} (30. cxd5 Rh8 $1 {[%cal Gd7h3] would be killing. The threat of
Bh3+ forced White to play} (30... c4 31. Bxc4 Nxc4) 31. g4 c4 $1 {Black is
totally dominating} 32. Bxc4 Nxc4 33. Rxc4 Bb5 $19) 30... fxg3 31. Bxg3 Bxg3

the outcome, as i'm just better and playing for two results here. My knight is
very strong on d6, and also his pawns are weaker than mine. A very hard
position to defend.} Rh8 {Activating the last piece.} 34. Bd3 (34. Bf1 $1 Rh4

knight vs bad bishop endgame. As my king also gets to d4, this is just a
winning position. The rest is a matter of technique, which was quite bad from
my side:} 43. Re3+ Kd4 44. Rd3+ Ke4 45. Rd1 Ke3 46. Bf1 Rf7 47. Rd3+ Ke4 48.

too passive:} 51. Rf6 $1 {[%cal Gf1e2,Gf6h6] threatening to deliver mate.}) 51.

was after} b5 54. cxb5 Kxd5 {and it is winning, as my knight is better than
his bishop, and the c-pawn will start to roll.} 55. a4 Nc4+) 50... Kxg4 {
Changing my a-pawn for his g-pawn. The g4-pawn seemed more important to me, as
my pawn will start to go forward.} 51. Rxa7 Nf5 {My opponent was down to 2-3
minutes here, playing only on the 30 sec increment which obviously increased
my chances of winning the game.} 52. Be2+ Kf4 53. Bd3 Nh4+ 54. Kf2 g4 $6 (54...

of the board.} 56. Re7 Nf5 $1) 55. Rg7 $6 (55. Re7 $1 $11 {A very good move,

square.} 56. Be2 Ne5 57. Rg8 Ng6 58. Kg2 (58. Re8 $1 {Again the rook is well

easy task.} Kf3 63. Bh5 (63. Rg5 Ne3 (63... Rf8 $4 64. Rxf5+ Rxf5 65. Bxf5 g2
