$1 {This strongly brings to mind Deep Blue-Kasparov of course.  It also
reminds me of a game that Keith played as Black against Igor Rausis, where
Igor broke through with a stunning series of sacrifices. There has been a lot
of debate on the english chess forum other whether the disgraced Rausis was
already using an engine in that game, and as I don't want to be dragged into
any court cases, I have no desire to speculate. All I would say is if you
cheat once, then you can't really complain if it becomes open season against
you.  Incidentally It seems ironic now that in the Deep Blue match, Kasparov
was accusing the machine of receiving human assistance.} Kxf7 (11... Rxf7 12.
Bxg6 Rf8 (12... Nf8 13. Bxf7+ Kxf7 14. Ne5+ Kg8 15. Re1 {just gives White a
huge advantage as Black's kingside is shredded.}) 13. Qe2 Qc7 {is the machines
recommendation as being the best way to defend.}) 12. Nh4 g5 13. Ng6 Re8 {[#]}
14. Ne5+ $2 ({As I said in the commentary at the time, in the 19th century
they would have played} 14. f4 $1 {without thinking. It just looks so natural
that you don't even think here, you just play it. It brings the rook into the
game, it threatens to take on g5, and Black is essentially being crushed right
out of the opening.} g4 15. hxg4 $18) 14... Kg8 15. f4 gxf4 16. Bxf4 Nxe5 17.

depressing} 17... Be6 18. exf6 exf6 19. Qf3 f5 {which would have maintained
some kind of parity, even if you are left with a rather dire looking position.}
) 18. Bxh6 $1 {Toma is still extremely alert and goes for the jugular, and
this had already been suggested by the watching Lawrence Trent (no doubt with
engine in hand.)} Bxh6 19. Qh5 {winning by force, and the game should have
ended over the next few moves.} Nf4 20. Rxf4 Qxd3 (20... Bxf4 21. Qh7+ Kf8 22.

edge back into the game around about here, but fortunately for Toma, her
positional and material edge is so large that she manages to close it out
anyway.} 25. Qg6 Qg7 26. Qe8+ Qg8 27. Qxc6 Be6 28. Rd1 Re8 29. Rd4 Re7 30. Rh4
