35. Rb3 {After playing pretty bad chess Hou Yifan finds herself down a passed
pawn on a3, with cramped pieces and a relatively unsafe king. Leitao is
winning, but in the World Cup, especially with time pressure, anything can
happen.} Nb6 36. Nb5 Rxc1 37. Bxc1 a2 {Qxc1 is already a threat.} 38. Ba3 Bxa3
(38... Qd7 $1) 39. Nxa3 Nc4 40. Qxa2 {White has recovered her pawn, but she has
clear issues with the pin. Just applying some pressure collapses her position.}
Nxa3 $4 (40... Qd8 $1 {with Qa5 next move}) (40... Qf8 41. Bxc4 dxc4 42. Rc3
Bd3 {with a crushing position.}) ({Black's position is so good that passing a

43. Bf3 Bxf3 {Even in this final position Black is better due to White's king
weakness.} 1/2-1/2
