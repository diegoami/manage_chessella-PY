is the main move in this position, but very soon we reach a position which is
similar to this.} )0-0-0 14. Rhe1 Na5 {The first new move of the game.} 15. f5 $1 {Inarkiev already begins to soften up the e6 point in the position.} Kb8 16. fxe6 fxe6 17. Ne2 $1 {The knight will move to f4 where it will put
more pressure on the e6 pawn.} Nc6 18. Nf4 Ne5 19. Bf1 $1 {Another wonderful
move. The idea is to preserve the bishop. At the same time, if Black takes on
f3, then after gxf3, the bishop will move to h3 and attack the e6 pawn. Also
don't forget that the knight can move to d4 and put a lot of pressure on the
e6 point.} Ng6 20. g3 $1 Nxf4 21. gxf4 Rhe8 22. Bh3 {The pressure on e6
