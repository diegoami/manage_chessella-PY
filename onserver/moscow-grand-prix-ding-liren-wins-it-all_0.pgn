{Hello everyone! This is GM Aleksandr Lenderman presenting you the final Game
of the Day of Moscow Grand Prix! And the choice is easy here. The fight for
first place ended with Ding Liren winning a decisive game against Boris
Gelfand. So, without further ado, let's get to it.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 d5
4. Bg2 Bb4+ 5. Bd2 Be7 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O Nbd7 8. a4 a5 9. Qc2 c6 10. Na3 Ne4 $5
{A very rare move already. In an earlier game betwen Gelfand and Tomashevsky,
10...Bd6 was played and Black had to suffer a bit before eventually getting a
draw.} (10... Bd6 11. Ne1 Qe7 12. Nd3 e5 13. cxd5 Nxd5 14. Bxd5 cxd5 15. Nb5 e4
16. Nf4 Nf6 17. Rfc1 {Gelfand-Tomashevsky Moscow Grand Prix round 4} (17. Qb3
$5 {Was maybe an improvement.})) 11. Bf4 $146 {The only other game I could find
after 10...Ne4 in my database was with 11.Be3!? in a game between two very
strong players.} (11. Be3 f5 12. Ne1 g5 13. f3 Nd6 14. Nd3 Qe8 15. c5 Nf7 {Was
a very complex battle in Hertneck,G (2572)-Bareev,E (2719) Germany 2002}) 11...
g5 {The typical logical follow up after the Ne4 idea is to play on the
kingside.} 12. Be3 (12. Bc1 $5) 12... f5 13. Rad1 Bf6 14. Nb1 Qe7 {I think
Black is already happy here. He got a very interesting unbalanced position with
Black with play for 3 results. And Ding is extremely good in positions like
this too.} 15. Nc3 b6 16. Ne5 $5 {A very interesting, ambitious move, and
probably not the only one.} (16. b3 $5) 16... Nxe5 17. dxe5 Bxe5 18. Bxb6 Qb4 {
Not the only move in the position but the most direct.} (18... Nxc3 19. bxc3
Ba6 20. cxd5 cxd5 21. Bxa5 Rfc8 $44 {was also a possible sample line.}) (18...
Bxc3 19. bxc3 Ba6 20. Bxe4 $14) (18... Ra6 19. Bd4 Bxd4 20. Rxd4 {Is also
roughly equal.}) 19. Nxe4 fxe4 20. cxd5 $2 {So far both sides have played good
precise and principled chess. However, now, Gelfand seems to miscalculate or
misevaluate something because he doesn't quite seem to have enough for the
sacrifised material. Sometimes last rounds can be tricky even for the most
experienced players. Gelfand was probably really hoping to win this game to tie
for 1st since the difference between tying for first and tying for 3rd in a
massive tie is huge in terms of Grand Prix points. So maybe he decided to take
a gamble in this game he normally wouldn't have. It didn't work in his favor in
this game though.} (20. Be3 Qxb2 21. Qxb2 Bxb2 22. Bxg5 Ba6 23. cxd5 ( 23. Rd2
{This first might be a bit more accurate though.} Bc3 24. Rc2 {And no more
Rac8}) 23... cxd5 (23... Bxe2 $2 24. dxc6 $16) 24. Rd2 $15 {Seems more or less
normal for White and very close to equal.}) 20... Qxb6 21. Qxe4 Qxb2 ( 21...
Qc7 22. dxe6 Rb8 {Is also good for Black, but what Ding did was better.}) 22.
dxc6 Bc7 $17 23. Rd7 Bxd7 24. cxd7 Qf6 $19 {Honestly speaking I'm not totally
sure what exactly Gelfand missed since in each move Black seemed to have other
alternatives to get a good position.} (24... Ra6 {Also wins.}) 25. Bh3 Rab8 26.
Qxe6+ Qxe6 27. Bxe6+ {Trying to save in the endgame thanks to many pawns for
the rook but White's problem is that Black's rooks are too active and the d7
pawn isn't going anywhere thanks to the bishop and rooks stopping it.} Kg7 28.
Rc1 Kf6 29. Bg4 Bd8 30. Rc6+ Kg7 31. Bh5 Rb2 32. Rc8 Rd2 33. Be8 Bb6 34. Rb8
Rf6 35. e3 g4 {And with that, Ding wins the Moscow Grand Prix clear first.
Congrulations to him! Congrulations also to Shakhriyar Mamedyarov for a very
strong clear 2nd place with +2 and continuing his monsterous form and also now
being in excellent position to get one of the top 2 spots in the overall
Grandprix Standings.} 0-1
