{Speaking about study-like ideas, as it was the case in Naiditsch vs Granda or
Greet vs Dronavalli, there is one person you could ask about insights in this
special and beautiful world: IM Yochanan Afek and GM in composing! And just in
between, enjoy this miniature he played on the island!} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3.

very good tournament, especially if we consider that he had to face not less
than seven GMs in a row, followed by a WGM and then another GM in the last
round! I think composing keeps you sharp, so go ahead and try to solve his
special study, dedicated to the PokerStars IoM tournament.} 0-1
