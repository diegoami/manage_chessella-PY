this position Black has two ways to continue. One is to go directly Nd4 and
other one is to include a5 and b5 before playing Nd4. Anish chooses the latter.

new move of the game but it seemed as if both were already out of their
preparation. The plans in this position are pretty well established and both
the players are following them. A move here or there doesn't really change the
character of the game.} 17. Nde4 $5 {An interesting idea by Peter who doesn't
mind giving up an exchange to Bb3.} Nxe4 18. Nxe4 (18. dxe4 Bb3 19. Rxb3 axb3

play.} (18... Bb3 $6 {This wins an exchange but gives White excellent light
square control.} 19. Rxb3 axb3 20. Qxb3+ $44) 19. Nc5 Bxg2 20. Kxg2 Bxc5 21.
Qxc5 Qe6 $1 {At this point the position might be round about equal but it seems
like Black has much easier play thanks to his knight having more scope against
the bishop.} 22. Bb2 (22. Qxc7 $2 Nd5 23. Qc2 Rfc8 $19 {With the knight coming
to c3 it is just winning for Black.}) (22. e4 {Svidler wanted to play this but
was afraid of} f5 {White should be fine after} 23. Bb2 $13) 22... Rf7 23. Bc3

it but he wasn't sure if it was any good.} 30. Kg1 Nxb4 31. Qxb4 Rd4 (31...

although it should be a draw.} 44. Rf8 (44. Re8 {was surely better to keep the

has sufficient defensive resources and Anish kept trying to avoid his 12th draw
