Qe2 $5 {Inviting some real complications. Black has to take on d4, otherwise he
is just worse after a trade on c5.} cxd4 16. Nxd4 Qxd4 {A free knight, why not
take it? Actually this is a queen sacrifice, but Black gets plenty for it.} 17.
Nd5 Rxc1 18. Rxc1 (18. Bxd4 $2 Rxe1+ 19. Qxe1 exd5 {is too much material.})
18... Qxb2 19. Qxb2 exd5 {White has a queen, but Black has three pieces. This
is a very unusual balance that more often than not favors the three pieces.
However, White has some initiative that must be dealt with.} 20. e5 Nd7 $6 (
20... Ng4 $1 21. Qe2 (21. f4 Bc5+ {is certainly not the same.})) 21. f4 Ndc5 {
Black's pieces are rather clumsy.} 22. Qc2 Ne6 23. b4 b5 24. Bf1 Rd8 25. Qd3 {
White's pawns on the kingside threaten to advance, meanwhile Black's knights
fail to find support while his bishops are hemmed in.} Nec7 26. Qd4 Ra8 {a sad
move to make, but Qxa7 was simply lethal.} 27. f5 g6 28. e6 $1 {Black's
position collapses.} fxe6 (28... Bg7 29. exf7+ Kxf7 30. Rxc7+ Nxc7 31. Qf4 {
with a decisive attack.}) 29. Qe5 Rc8 30. Bxb5 exf5 31. Bxa6 {Black is simply
pinned everywhere and material losses cannot be avoided.} (31. Bxa6 Nxa6 32.
