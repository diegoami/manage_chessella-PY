Bc5 9. Qd2 O-O 10. O-O-O a6 11. Nb3 Bb4 12. Bd3 b5 13. Nd4 {Very rare. Almost
everyone playis 13.g4, and it scores very well. Surely Vovk knew what he was
doing as he was playing very quickly until 13.Nd4 appeared on the board.} (13.
g4 Na5 14. Bd4 Nc4 $13 {Gharamian-Ni Hua 2011, for example.}) 13... Bb7 {
Natural. The position is a very clear sharp French. Black's attack on the
queenside looks menacing, but you can never underestimate how fast White can
achieve things on the kingside.} 14. Nxc6 Bxc6 15. Bd4 Nc5 16. Qf2 Nxd3+ 17.
Rxd3 Be7 18. Nd1 b4 19. Rh3 Rc8 20. Ne3 f5 {A classic idea. Winning some space
on the kingside allows Black more defensive resources on that side. However, it
does allow White a break on that side of the board.} 21. g4 $6 (21. exf6 Bxf6
$17 {is not playable when White is so committed to the kingside.}) (21. Rg1
{preparing g4 was better.}) 21... fxg4 22. Nxg4 Be8 $1 {Suddenly the bad French
bishop is jumping to g6 with devastating effect!} 23. Nf6+ Bxf6 24. exf6 Bg6 $1
25. fxg7 Rf7 {The pawn on g7 does not harm White. He now has very difficult
problems to solve on the kingside.} 26. Be5 (26. c3 Qa5 $1 $19 {for example:}
27. Rg1 Qxa2 {leads to beautiful continuations, but honestly I doubt this was
Vovk's idea.} (27... Bf5 {is more human and probably what Vovk had in mind.
White cannot prevent Qxa2.}) 28. Rxg6 Qa1+ 29. Kc2 (29. Kd2 Qxb2+ 30. Ke3 Rxc3+
$1 31. Bxc3 Qxc3+ 32. Ke2 Qb2+ 33. Ke1 Qxf2+ 34. Kxf2 hxg6 {winning.}) 29...

attack.}) 31... Qf1+ 32. Qe2 Qxh3+ $19) 26... Qg5 $3 {Brilliant. The queen
attacks e5 and reinforces all the threats on the queenside by placing itself on
f5 when the time is right.} 27. Re3 Bxc2 $1 28. Kd2 Bg6 29. Rc1 Rxc1 30. Kxc1
Qf5 {in opposite colored bishop situations, the most important thing is king
safety. It is obvious that White is the one suffering here.} 31. Qe2 d4 $1 32.
Rb3 (32. Bxd4 Qb1+ 33. Kd2 Rc7 $19) (32. Rg3 {was the best try, but already
White is losing.} Qb1+ 33. Kd2 Qxb2+) 32... Qb1+ 33. Kd2 Qc2+ 34. Ke1 d3 $1 35.
