{A long day in the office: it was the 2nd round of the day and having two pawns
up, I thought I should automatically win this. But the final result appears
only when the scoresheets are signed...} 36... Rc8 $2 {is what I played and
right after pressing my clock I realized I took a terrible decision} (36... h5
$142 {preventing} 37. Rf2 h4+) 37. Re3 $2 {returning the favour} ({ The best
chances that White has is to enter in an opposite color bishops endgame, where
the two extra pawns will lose a bit from their powers.} 37. Rc2 {I remembered I
fell into a classical trap, but couldn't recall the players' names. Here they
are though: Efim Bogoljubov vs Edward Lasker, a game that I will present you
shortly after.} Rxc2 {not trading the rooks allows White to enter on the 7th
rank} 38. Bxc2 d5 39. Bb3 d4 40. Bc2 Bf6 41. Kf3 {I don't think this is
actually winning for Black as White has a firm grip on the light squares. You
can give it a try and let us all know if you discovered something. }) 37... b6
