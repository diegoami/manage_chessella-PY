1. c4 {(0s) This game and its seemingly unexpected finish had a crucial effect
on the final result of the match between Serbia and Ukraine.} c5 {(0s)} 2. Nf3
{(0s)} g6 {(0s)} 3. e4 {(314s) Rapport forces the game into a Maroczy-bind.}

here.}) 9... Bd7 {(360s)} 10. Qd2 {(74s)} Nxd4 {(218s)} 11. Bxd4 {(33s)} Bc6 {
(74s)} 12. f3 {(18s)} a5 {(35s) The players are following the general plans
for both sides. However, I started to doubt whether or not it was better for
White to keep her rook on a1 to see which plan Black would adopt.} 13. Be3 {
(1051s)} Nd7 {(503s)} 14. g4 $6 {(522s) Not a very good novelty.} a4 {(886s)}

(915s)} Nc5 {(493s)} 18. Rc2 {(98s)} a3 {(974s)} 19. b3 {(7s)} f5 {(26s) Anna
Muzychuk played a very risky continuation and engines do not seem to be fond
of it. Although, they do not give so much advantage to white either. I assess
this position as unclear and in game like this, anything can happen.} 20. h6 {
(284s)} {[%tqu "En","Move the bishop, or play something else? But what if not
the retreat?","","","f5g4","(321s) Good dynamic intuition. Black's
compensation for the sacrificed bishop is going to be very unpleasant.",10]}
