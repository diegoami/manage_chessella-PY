31... Rf6 {[%cal Gg6f6] Black has just played his
rook from g6 to f6. The question that you need to solve is whether the
pawn on b6 is poisoned or can be taken? It is the most critical position
of the game.} 32. Rxb6 $2 {I took the pawn after six minutes of thinking
which means I was down to four minutes on the clock. It turned out to
be a mistake. But the refutation is not so easy to see.} Nxd4 $3 {My opponent
played this move without having seen all the details. In the limited time
that we had it was surely impossible to calculate everything. If you worked
it out, you are truly a very strong player.} ({ Also extremely strong
was} 32... Rdf5 $1 33. Rb2 {I wanted to meet it with this move defending
f2 but now Black has the strong} Nxd4 $1 {After the game Nils told me
about this possibilty, but he was not 100% sure whether it worked. } 34.
exd4 Qd5 $1 $19 {The rook on a8 is attacked and e3 is going to be crushing.}
(34... e3 $6 35. f4 $1 Qc6+ 36. Qg2 Qc1+ 37. Qg1 Qc6+ $11)) 33. Rxf6 Ne6
$2 {This move lets White defend against the mating threats.} (33... Nf3
$3 {Of course I had not missed this move but I had seen the intermediate
Rd6 as a defence. Turns out Black has some more ammo in his gun.} 34.
Rd6 {This looks like White wins but Black has a nice shot.} Rh5 $3 35.
Qg2 (35. h4 Qg4 $1 { And now it is impossible to defend against the mate
threats.} (35... Nxh4 36. Rxd7 Nf3+ 37. Qh3 Rxh3+ 38. Kg2 Rh2+ 39. Kf1

simplification
that wins the d1 rook.} 37. Qxh2 Nxh2 38. Kxh2 Qh5+ 39. Kg2 Qf3+ 40. Kg1

you did!}) 34. Qc4 $1 (34. Rxf7 Qxf7 $15) 34... gxf6 35. Qc8 (35. Qxe4+
f5 $19) 35... Qxc8 36. Rxc8 $11 {The position is equal, but with very
less time on the clock I blundered a pawn and went on to lose the game.
The tactical melee starting with Rxb6 was quite interesting, don't you
agree?} 0-1
