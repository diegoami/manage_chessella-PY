offbeat line at the time.} ( {He avoids the Scheveningen } 3. d4 cxd4 4.

Black can counter vigorously with...Nf6,...e5 and ...Nc5. This line is
still in a state of flux.} ) 5. O-O ( 5. Nc3 {is more usual.} )  5... a6 (

favoured White.} ) 6. Bxd7 Nxd7 7. Nc3 e6 8. Bg5 Qc7 9. Re1 cxd4 10. Nxd4 (
10. Qxd4 Ne5 11. Rad1 Bd7 {was seen in Ljubojevic-Kasparov, Amsterdam 1991

is Tal! He must have played this sacrifice in any number of positions in
his life. Here it's rather premature.} ( {He could have set more problems
for Garry with} 15. e5 $5  15... Bxe5 16. Nd5 Qd6 ( {After}  16... exd5 $2

moves that followed. What is known that Garry was unable to solve the
problems set by Tal in 5 minutes and lost on time.}
