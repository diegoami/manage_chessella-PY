typical position that arises but White doesn't really have a plan while Black
will just advance on the queenside. He will just fianchetto the bishop on g7
and at the right moment to play ..e6-e5 to prevent any kingside operations
from White}) 11... dxe5 12. dxe5 Nd5 13. Ne4 {Bg5 is coming and although ..h6
makes castling hard for Black it is probably best} Rd8 (13... h6 14. Ng3 {
Now castling runs into Qd3 but White can't do anything about Black's king in
the center}) (13... Nxe5 $2 14. Nxe5 Qxe5 15. Nxc5 Qc7 16. Nxb7 Qxb7 17. Qg4
$16 {An open position like this definitely favors White with the bishop pair
and some prospects on the kingside}) 14. Bg5 O-O (14... Nxe5 $2 15. Nxe5 Qxe5 {
The tactics don't work out for Black} 16. Nf6+ Nxf6 17. Rxe5 Rxd1+ 18. Rxd1 Nd7

The attack far outweights the piece}) 15. Ng3 {The threat of Bxe7 and Bxh7+
looks scary but Black has a way to stop all of White's plans} g6 $6 (15... Bxg5
$5 16. Bxh7+ Kxh7 (16... Kh8 {is enough for a draw and probably best} 17. Nxg5

draw} Nxe5 19. Qh4 Nxg2 20. Qh3 Nf4 21. Qh4 $11) 17. Nxg5+ Kg8 18. Qh5 N5f6 19.
exf6 Nxf6 20. Qh4 {[%cal Rg3h5,Ge1e3,Ge3h3] and White has some ideas of Nh5
and Re3-h3}) (15... N7b6 {is simple and natural} 16. Qc1 {Here Black has not
created any weaknesses so it is harder for White to come up with something.} (
16. Bxe7 Qxe7 {Black is definitely not worse} (16... Nxe7 17. Bxh7+ $1 {
is what White was hoping for}))) 16. Qc1 {Now there are some ideas of Bxe7 and
Qh6 with an attack} f6 $2 {After this Black's position collapses} (16... c4 {
[%cal Rd7c5] with the idea of bringing the knight to c5 was an idea} 17. Ne4 {
White is probably a bit better but it's far from decisive}) 17. exf6 Bxf6 (
17... N5xf6 18. Rxe6 {is also winning a pawn}) 18. Rxe6 Bxg5 19. Qxg5 {Black
must have been relying on two ideas: ..Nf4 or ..Rxf3 but the complications
work in White's favor} Rxf3 $2 (19... Nf4 $2 20. Re7 Bxf3 21. Qh6 Rf7 22. Rxf7

fxg3 (21. Bxh7+ Kf7 22. Qf5+ N7f6 23. fxg3 {was also winning but White goes
for the safer option}) 21... N7f6 {is pretty much forced otherwise Black is
getting mated} 22. Rxf6 Nxf6 23. Be4+ Kf7 24. Rf1 Rd6 (24... Bxe4 $4 25. Rxf6+
{with mate}) 25. Qe5 $1 {The threat of Rxf6 forces Black to give up material}

Rb1 (28. Bxa6 $6 Rxb2 {just complicates things}) 28... a5 {If White is not
careful, the active rook can give Black some serious drawing chances} 29. Bf3 {
The idea is simple: Re1+ followed by Re2 securing the second rank for the
White king} b4 30. cxb4 (30. Re1+ Kd6 31. Re2 $2 Rxe2 32. Bxe2 bxc3 33. bxc3

requires some more effort}) 32. Re2 Rd1+ 33. Kf2 {Now the king is cut off from
the e-file and White can start advancing his extra pawns} Ra1 34. b3 Rc1 35. g4

g5} 38. Re6 Kf7 39. Rc6 Ke7 40. Kf5 Ng8 41. Rg6 Kf8 42. Ra6 Rd3 43. Kg6 Rd8 44.
