{This study, of which the award was published in the ARVES club magazine EBUR
in December 2003, shows three chameleon echo variations in a natural setting.
Creating a setting that looks very simple and has no difficult variations,
looking as if "everyone" could compose it, is one sign of mastery of chess
composition, unless it is a lucky find. In this case, the Georgian author of
this work is well-known for his contributions to the world of endgame studies,
being a (metaphorical) "motor" (i.e. prolific enthusiast who keeps on
promoting endgame studies and helping composers) for his country. EBUR was
later absorbed into John Roycroft's EG after it started becoming an ARVES
publication as well. - White is to move and hold a draw.} 1. c8=Q Rd6+ 2. Rd7

{White is to move and hold a draw. - Unfortunately the original setting by
Liburkin (Ceskoslovensky Sach, January 1954) was incorrect, allowing at worst
the equivalent to 2.R:g8 here, completely destroying the intent. Adding a lot
of material on tha a- and b-file, Nikolay Kralin corrected the study in 1981.
Still, even with this ugly addition, the core idea of the study is brillant
enough to show here, containing no less than six(!) chameleon echo variations.
Sadly "only" five of them work. For a short overview, the position of the echo
pieces (black knight and white king) is given at the end of those variations. -

you would want to explain what a systematic manoeuver is. Yes, it is worth
showing again and again. Yes, probably most readers already know it. Yes,

three underpromotions on the way, as well as sadly a difficult sideline. -

is forced to give checks. Luckily Black just has not enough space for his king.

{Not in the August 1940 publication in Shakhmaty v SSSR, but only in the June
1987 correction by Anatoly Kuznetsov in "64 - Shakhmatnoye Obozrenye" was a
correct setting for this study reached. While some composers - for example
Mario Garcia from Argentina - specialize in correcting old studies, others
correct studies directly when they find an incorrectness or at least try so.
And of course some composers find incorrect old studies without really
searching for it and then see if they can find a correct setting, sometimes
even finding completely new ideas for own studies in the process. Although we
don't know the exact story, we can speculate that Kuznetsov possibly saw the
incorrect study in Kofman's book and then decided to correct it. In any case,
