1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Yu Yangyi may have felt very reserved and cautious
meeting the tournament leader. It is somewhat uncharacteristic of him to go for
such an untra-safe choice.} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Be7 7. c4 $5
{An interesting choice from Wei Yi. He is testing his opponent's knowledge in
some sidelines of the Petroff defence.} Bb4+ 8. Kf1 $5 {Another unexpected
move! The logic behind this move is that White wants to keep as much material
on the board and win a number of tempi thanks to the misplaced bishop on b4. On
the downside, White's king on f1 would cause a bit of discoordination.} (8.

watch.} Be7 10. cxd5 Nf6 (10... Qxd5 11. Qc2 Nf6 12. Nc3 Qd8 13. h4 {looks as
challenging as what Yu Yangyi faced during the game.} Be6 14. Bg5 h6 15. Re1
Nbd7 16. Rxe6 $1 fxe6 17. Bc4 {is hard to evaluate but looks very dangerous
for Black.}) 11. Nc3 Nbd7 12. h4 $1 {A thematic and romantic move. It is funny
that a move of this kind would have been considered just natural 130 years ago
while we give it an exclam in the 21st century!} Nb6 13. Bg5 Nfxd5 14. Qc2 h6
15. Re1 {Of course the Bg5 is taboo.} Re8 16. Ne5 {I am not sure which one is
faster: Wei Yi's attack in this game or Usain Bolt!} Bxg5 $2 {In fact Black
has only few good moves and I find it hard to criticize Yu Yangyi for missing
it. Although, I definitely can claim that the Chinese opening choice was very
dubious given his past experience in this line.} (16... Be6 {This normal move
for instance, loses almost on the spot!} 17. Bh7+ Kh8 (17... Kf8 18. Ng6+ fxg6

winning attack for White.}) 22... Qxh5 23. Nd7+ Bxd7 24. Qxh5 Rad8 {OK, now we
have a position where White has a queen for rook+knight+pawn. Materially it is
equal but White has sort of a bind around Black's king. To keep things
together, Black needs to maintain both rooks on the board, secure the f7
square and blockade on d5 with his knight.} 25. Qc5 Bc6 26. Bc2 a6 27. Bb3 Rd6

White a queen's maneuver.} 29. Rxe8+ Kxe8 30. Qg4 g6 31. Bxd5 $1 {c7 falls!}

White should be able to break Black's fortress but that was a long way away!}
53. g4 {now d5 cannot be stopped and the little soldier would decide the game!}
Rb5+ 54. Kc3 hxg4 55. a4 {a necessary finesse, otherwise Black plays Bg2 and
d5 is once more blockaded.} Rf5 56. fxg4 Rf3+ 57. Kb4 {Now it is over and the
