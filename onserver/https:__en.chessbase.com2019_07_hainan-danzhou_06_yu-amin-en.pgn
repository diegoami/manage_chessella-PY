10. Ne2 Re8 11. f3 c5 12. Bg5 a6 13. Qd2 Qc7 {[#] This position has been
reached on occasion, including 25 years ago in a game between the American
grandmasters Yasser Seirawan and Alex Yermolinsky.} 14. b3 ({Seirawan played} 
14. Bxf6 {at the time, but he was in a slightly worse position after that.})
14... Nd7 15. f4 Nf6 {Sometimes the moves of grandmasters are easy to
understand: With 15.f4 White has furthered his attacking plans on the kingside,
but at the same time he has taken away a defender of the e4-pawn and given up
control of the g4 square. It's logical that Amin immediately returns his
knight back to f6.} 16. Bxf6 {This too is logical: The black knight should not
be allowed to jump to e4 or g4.} ({Also possible was} 16. Rae1 Nxe4 17. Ng3 f5
18. Nxe4 fxe4 19. Bxe4) 16... Bxf6 17. Kh1 {Clearing g1 for the knight which
would be better placed on f3.} (17. b4 {was worth considering, but it would
have entailed a different concept. The poisition is reminiscent of the Benoni 
(although there is usually not a black pawn on d4). White prefers to follow
the plan of a kingside pawn storm, which is common in such positions.}) 17...
b5 {Black is now also active. An exciting position!} 18. Ng1 bxc4 19. bxc4 Rb8
20. Rae1 Bh4 21. Re2 Bg4 22. Nf3 Bf6 {Black doesn't allow White's e4-e5 push.}
23. h3 Bxf3 24. Rxf3 Rb7 25. Qe1 Bg7 (25... Reb8 26. e5 {would not have been a
welcome development for Black.}) 26. g4 Qb8 {White cannot get in e5 and deal
with Black's activity on the queenside at the same time, so he switches to
'Plan B', the push f4-f5.} 27. g5 Rb2 28. Rff2 Rb4 29. h4 Qc8 {Again, this is
a simple move to understand: White has once again left a hole on g4 and the
black queen threatens to invade there.} 30. f5 Be5 {Now e5 is accessible and
the black bishop lodges itself on this magnificent square forever. It's easy
to imagine that it could make a powerful team with a rook on b2 later in the
endgame.} 31. Rf3 Qb7 32. Kg2 Rb2 33. Rff2 Qb4 {The queen exchange likely
favours Black. White's attack on the black kind is diffused and Black controls
the only open lines.} 34. Qxb4 Rxb4 {[#]} 35. Kh3 ({Here probably} 35. Rb2 $1 {
was better.} Reb8 36. Rxb4 Rxb4 {Black will struggle to make further progress.}
) 35... Reb8 {Not Black really has total control. White can only wait.} 36. Kg4
Ra4 (36... a5 {is the move of the computer at this point. Whether that would
have been enough to win is unclear, but Black could have initially planted a
rook on b2 and then brought his king into the action.}) 37. h5 ({Here White
missed} 37. Rb2 $1) 37... Ra3 38. Rf3 Rc3 (38... gxh5+ 39. Kxh5 f6 {was
probably best. The maneuver would have given Black a chance to get his rook to
g8.}) 39. hxg6 hxg6 40. Ref2 Rc1 41. Rf1 Rxf1 42. Bxf1 ({Better was} 42. Rxf1
Rb2 43. Rb1) 42... Rb1 43. a3 Re1 44. fxg6 fxg6 45. Bd3 {[#]} Kg7 {This gives
lets all Black's advantage slip away.} (45... Rg1+ $1 46. Kh4 Kg7 {would have
retained the rook.} 47. Rf1 $2 Rg3 48. Rd1 Bf4 {etc. The bishop-rook team
would have scored a goal.}) 46. Rf1 $1 {After the rooks are exchanged, the
position is drawn.} Rxf1 47. Bxf1 Kf7 48. Kf3 Ke7 49. Bh3 Bh2 50. Bc8 a5 51. a4
