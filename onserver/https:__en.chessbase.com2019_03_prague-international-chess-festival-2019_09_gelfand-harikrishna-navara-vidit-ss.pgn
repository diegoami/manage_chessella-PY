1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 Bb4 {Vidit as we all know is a big fan of
the Ragozin!} 5. Qb3 {This is one of the most solid lines from white against
the Ragozin.} c5 6. dxc5 Na6 (6... Nc6 {is played more often and after} 7. Bg5
Qa5 8. Bxf6 dxc4 9. Qxc4 gxf6 {we reach a position which has been well
analyzed and seems to hold quite fine for Black. But Vidit has his own
favourite lines and he goes for ...Na6.}) 7. a3 Bxc3+ 8. Qxc3 Nxc5 9. cxd5 Qxd5
10. Be3 Nce4 {38 games have reached this position and now Navara plays a move
that has only been seen once.} 11. Qb4 $5 (11. Qe5 {has been the main move and
the game which has stuck in my mind is Fedoseev vs Matlakov.} Qxe5 12. Nxe5 Nd5
13. Bc1 $1 {This retreating move is very instructive. Black has better
development it seems. But next White will play f3 and then e4 and kick back
black's pieces.} Bd7 14. f3 Nc5 15. e4 Nb3 16. Rb1 Nb6 17. Be3 Rc8 {It is
difficult to judge this position. It seems as if White is better from the long
term point of view because of the bishop pair, but overall Black's activity
should be enough to hold the balance. The results suggest Black is doing fine.}
) (11. Qd4 O-O {In the game Navara provoked the move a5. The question is
whether this move spoils Black's position, or just gives him a free tempo?})
11... a5 12. Qd4 O-O 13. Ne5 a4 {Fixing the queenside pawns.} 14. Nd3 (14. f3

was well on his way towards victory. 0-1 (25) Moranda,W (2599)-Tregubov,P 
(2592) Germany 2018}) 14... Rd8 (14... Qa5+ 15. Qb4 $14) 15. Qxd5 Nxd5 16. Bc1
{As compared to the normal line where White plays directly Qe5 on move 11,
Black has nearly three tempi more in this position! Yet, White is doing fine!
The pleasures of having the first move!} b5 (16... f5 $5) 17. f3 Nd6 18. e4 Nb6
19. Bd2 (19. Bf4 {should have been preferred by Navara.} Nbc4 20. Bxd6 Nxd6 21.

Ne3 21. Ke2 Nbc4 {Vidit is building up the pressure.} 22. Ne5 Ba6 23. Nxc4 Nxc4
24. Rc1 $2 {A pretty simple oversight by Navara.} (24. Kf2 Nxb2 25. Be2 Nd3+
26. Ke3 Nc5 27. Rad1 $44 {is decent compensation for the pawn for White.})
24... b4 $1 25. Bxb4 (25. axb4 Nd2+ $19 {is similar to the game, just that the
pawn structure is worsened.}) 25... Nd2+ 26. Ke3 Nxf1+ 27. Rhxf1 Bxf1 28. Rxf1
Rac8 {Rest, you can say is matter of technique, but you keep seeing winning
positions being botched up. Hence, it wouldn't hurt to learn a think or two
from Vidit on how to convert such positions.} 29. Bc3 f6 $1 {Limiting the
bishop and getting the king into the game.} 30. h3 Kf7 31. Rg1 Rd7 32. Ke2 Kg6
33. Ke3 Kg5 {The king is just moving in to create more weaknesses in
opponent's camp.} 34. Rc1 (34. g3 h5 35. h4+ Kg6 {Later on you can open a
front with g5.}) 34... Kg6 35. Kf2 h5 36. Kg3 Rd3 37. Kf2 h4 {Fixing the
kingside pawns.} 38. Ke2 Rd7 39. Ke3 Kh5 40. Rf1 Rcd8 41. Ke2 Rb8 42. Rc1 Rb3

easy, but subsequently Black will breakthrough.}) 51. Rc6+ Kg5 52. Bc3 fxe4 53.
