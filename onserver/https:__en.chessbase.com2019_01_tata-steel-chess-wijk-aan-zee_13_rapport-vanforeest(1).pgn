1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. Qa4+ ({In the earlier rounds,} 5.
e4 {was played by Vidit, Mamedyarov and Carlsen against Duda.}) 5... Nbd7 ({A
more solid reply is} 5... c6 6. Qxc4 b5 $1 {as in Karpov-Kasparov, Las Palmas
1996}) 6. e4 a6 (6... c5 $6 7. d5 exd5 8. e5 $1 b5 $8 9. Qxb5 Rb8 10. Qa4 d4
11. exf6 dxc3 12. Bxc4 $1 Rb4 13. Qc2 $1 {was better for White in Miles-Karpov,
Biel 1990, because after} Rxc4 $2 14. Qe2+ {follows.}) 7. Bxc4 $1 Rb8 $1 8. Qc2
b5 9. Bd3 Bb7 {This risky variation for Black was nevertheless used by many
strong grandmasters.} 10. Bf4 {One of the most important moves, already played
by Rapport in the past.} Rc8 11. d5 ({Instead,} 11. Rd1 c5 12. d5 c4 13. dxe6
cxd3 14. exf7+ $2 ({normal is} 14. exd7+ Qxd7 {with the idea of} 15. Rxd3 Qg4)
14... Kxf7 15. Rxd3 Qe8 $1 16. O-O Nc5 $17 {was Kramnik-Ehlvest, Novgorod 1995.
And 11.d5 is an improvement, introduced by Gelfand in 1997. White sacrifices a
pawn for the initiative, Black is underdeveloped and should really know what
to do here. But Van Foreest apparently didn't.}) 11... exd5 (11... Nc5 $5 {
Mchedlishvili-Van den Doel, Hilversum 2008}) 12. O-O-O $1 d4 $2 $146 ({A
correct continuation, at least twice played by Van Wely, is} 12... Nc5 $1 {
though even here} 13. e5 $1 ({instead of} 13. Nxd5 Nxd5 14. exd5 Nxd3+ {
followed by ...Be7 = as in Van Wely's games}) 13... Nh5 14. Be3 $1 $44 {looks
really interesting for White.}) ({While} 12... dxe4 $2 {is a very bad move
from Rapport-Marjanovic, Vrnjacka Banja 2010.}) 13. Nxd4 Nh5 14. Be3 $1 {
Unfortunately for Black, his position is unplayable whatever he does. What
shouldn't be a big surprise, having a knight on h5 and the king still in
centre.} c5 15. Nf5 g6 16. Be2 $1 Ng7 ({If} 16... b4 17. Nd5 ({or even} 17.
Nd6+ Bxd6 18. Rxd6 bxc3 19. Qxc3)) 17. Nd6+ Bxd6 18. Rxd6 $18 {And White
completely dominates.} Qe7 19. Rhd1 Bc6 20. Rxd7 Bxd7 21. Nd5 1-0
