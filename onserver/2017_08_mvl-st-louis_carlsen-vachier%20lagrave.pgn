sometimes aims for a relatively unexplored position, not bothering about
'objective correctness'} Qxd1+ 7. Kxd1 Bf5 8. Nd2 Nc6 9. e4 Bg6 10. Bb5 Rc8 11. h4 h5 12. Re1 e6 13. a4 Be7 14. g3 0-0 15. a5 Rfd8 16. a6 b6 17. Kc2 Ne5 {
Blackâ€™s pieces look more harmoniously placed towards the centre while White
looks to have an uncoordinated army. But as described by Anatoly Karpov, it
seems to be one of those typical minus positions where White could improve his
pieces whereas it is difficult for Black to chart a path of play, when you are
not sitting with an engine next to you} 18. f4 Ng4 19. Kb3 f6 20. Nc4 Nf2 21. e5 Ne4 22. Be3 Bf5 23. Rg1 Rd5 24. Rae1 Kf7 25. Bc1 Bh7 26. Re3 Rcd8 27. Bc6 Nf2 28. Re2 Nd3 29. exf6 gxf6 30. Bb5 Rg8 {As the dust settles, it is clear
that the position has achieved dynamic equality, ready for Carlsen to start
pressuring the opponent by posing small problems} 31. Bd2 Rgd8 32. Be3 Be4 33. Rd2 Rg8 34. Ka4 Rgd8 35. Kb3 Rg8 36. Ka2 f5 37. Rh2 Rc8 38. Rd2 Rg8 39. Re2 Bf3 40. Rh2 Bf6 41. Nd2 Bg4 42. Rf1 Rgd8 43.

A rare tactical blunder by Carlsen. Later, MVL explained the fundamental flaw
in Carlsen's calculation} (46. Rd2 Rb8 (46... Rg8 47. Nxb6 $3 axb6 48. Bc4 {
wins for White} )47. Ka3 $1 {and Nd3 is in trouble} )Bh3 47. Rxg3 Bxf1 48. Rf3 $4 {Blunder number 2! But this was follow-up of the flawed calculation
which started off with 46.Rg2} (48. Bxd8 Rxd8 49. Rf3 Be2 50. Rxf5+ {would
have still led to equality} )Be2 49. Bxd8 ({As Vachier-Lagrave explained
after the game, Carlsen missed a simple tactic here, the reason for his misery:
} 49. Re3 f4 50. Rxe2 Nc1+ {and this knight fork nets the rook, which Carlsen
seems to have overlooked initially} )Bxf3 50. Bxb6 axb6 51. Bc6 Be4 {
MVL handled the technical conversion of the endgame without letups} 52. a7 Rd8 53. Nd6+ Rxd6 54. Bxe4 Rd8 55. a8=Q Rxa8+ 56. Bxa8 Ne5 57. Kb3 f4 58. Kc2 Kg7 59. Kd2 Ng6 60. Kd3 Nxh4 61. Ke4 f3 62.
