{How would you assess this position? At first sight it looks as if nothing is
happening. White has a weakness on a4 and Black has weaknesses on b6 and c6. It
seems as if they cancel out each other. But the important thing to note here is
that the b6 and c6 weaknesses can be protected by bishops on d8 and d7. Then
they are defending the weaknesses and also eyeing the kingside. Also crucial is
the semi-open f-file. While one of the black rooks can continuously put
pressure on the a4 pawn, the other one can go to the f-file and start attacking
the f2 pawn and also threaten a kingside attack. Black has a clear advantage.
It is interesting to see how Peter Leko misplayed this promising position.} 31.

f-file first.} (31... Rf8 $1 32. Qh5 Bc8 {Stopping Bh3.} 33. Rbc2 Bb8 34. Ne2
