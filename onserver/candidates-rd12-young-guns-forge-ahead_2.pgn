players in Sinquefield Cup 2014.}) 11... Bxa2 12. Rxa2 Nc6 13. Bg5 {Until now
we are following the game Anand-Aronian and Dominguez-Tomashevsky but now
Aronian deviates.} Nd7 14. Be3 Nf6 15. Qb1 {Angling for a4.} d5 16. Bg5 d4 17.
Bxf6 dxc3 $5 {This was an interesting pawn sacrifice. Caruana didn't think too
highly of this move at first but later realised that it was tricky. He
commended his opponent for his play after the game.} (17... Bxf6 18. Nd5 a5 {
was a normal way to continue.}) 18. Bxe5 Nxe5 19. Nxe5 Qd6 20. Ng4 $5 (20. Nf3

} Bf6 21. Kh1 Bxe5 22. fxe5 Qxe5 23. Rf5 Qd6 24. Ra1 {Black has regained the
pawn but White has much better structure and stands better.}) 20... a5 21. Ne3

compensation for Black for the pawn as after} axb4 25. Qxb4 $1 $16 {There is no
way to regain the pawn.}) 22... axb4 23. axb5 cxb5 24. Nd5 Rfb8 25. Nxe7+ $2 {A
pretty poor move which reduces all of White's advantage. It was better to keep
the knight on d5 as it is not possible to dislodge it from there.} (25. Rxa8

h3 g6 31. Qb3 Rd4 {The position is round about equal.} 32. Re1 Qa7 33. Kf1
{This plan of centralizing the king looks pretty dubious. Maybe it was better
to just stay put. The position is equal.} Kg7 34. Ke2 h4 35. Rd1 Qa5 36. Rb1
Qa6 37. Kf1 Qd6 38. Ra1 $2 {A careless move by Caruana. Aronian had a winning
move here, which could have been of the most brilliant combinations of the
entire tournament!} (38. Re1 $11) 38... Qc5 $2 (38... Rxd3 $3 {Unbelievable as
it may seem, this rook sacrifice is made not for an immediate finish but to
clear the path for the queenside pawns which just cannot be stopped!} 39. cxd3

b3-c2 etc.}) 40... Qxe4+ 41. Kf1 (41. Kd1 c2+ $1 42. Qxc2 Qd4+ $19) 41... Qd3+

threat is b3, b4 followed by Qc3!} 45. Kg1 b3 46. Rf1 (46. Kh2 Qf4+ 47. Kg1 b4

39. Rb1 Qa7 40. Ke2 g5 $6 {This move weakens the kingside a bit and it was
quite a drastic decision to make especially on the 40th move.} 41. Rg1 Qd7 42.
Ra1 Qe7 43. Ra6 Qc7 44. Ra8 Qf4 45. Ra1 g4 (45... Rxd3 {is similar to the
previous Rxd3 variation. The only difference is that the pawn is on g5 and this
is the thing which allows White to hold.} 46. cxd3 Qd2+ 47. Kf1 Qxd3+ 48. Kg1

Although the evaluation is equal, White is the one who has to be careful. He
must create counterplay before the Black king reaches to g3.} Kf6 60. d4 Kg5 (

improvement can be made and the game ends in a draw. A very interesting
battle.} 1/2-1/2
