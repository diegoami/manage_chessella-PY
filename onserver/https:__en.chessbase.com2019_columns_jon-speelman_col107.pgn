This position is more often reached (after an early Bf4) with the bishop on f4
when it is the London system. The bishop is more active there but b2 can be
annoyingly weak in the opening.} 7. dxc5 $6 {Of course this isn't unplayable
but the point of White's opening is to stymie Black's fionchettoed bishop with
a "granite wall" on the long diagonal and this is the first step to
