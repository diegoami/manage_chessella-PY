well-intended) mistake: Black wants to block the white centre pawns and keeps
an eye on the d4 square, but if White manages to get in e5 the black rook is
in a tight spot.} (28... Bxf4 $1 29. Nxf4 Qe5 $11) 29. Rg1 Red8 {Black

spot.} 32. Rg4 ({After} 32. Qg2 $1 {(which would have immobilized the
e8-knight) White would have been on the winning side, but not because of an
imminent mate on g7, but rather due to the activation of the central pawn mass:
