{Black against an extremely strong IM in one of the critical rounds of the
tournament, GM Stukopin played a nearly flawless game to secure his position at
the top of the table.} 1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e6 6.
Bf4 d5 7. e3 Bb4 8. Be2 Ne4 9. Ndb5 O-O 10. O-O Bxc3 11. Nxc3 Nxc3 12. bxc3
dxc4 13. Bxc4 Qf6 14. Rc1 {This move is a touch passive for my tastes.} (14.
Qh5 $5 Qxc3 15. Rfc1 {allows White to keep some initiative and prevent Black
from finishing his development.}) 14... e5 $1 15. Bg3 Be6 {Now Black is quite
comfortable.} 16. Bd5 Bxd5 17. Qxd5 Rad8 18. Qc4 h5 19. f4 {This move is a
little too panicky.} (19. Rcd1 {is simple and solid, with a level position.})
19... exf4 20. Bxf4 Rd2 {Andrey doesn't miss his chance to activate his rook.}
21. e4 Rb2 22. Bg3 Qg6 23. Rf2 Rxf2 24. Bxf2 Rd8 {White was already in time
trouble, which probably doubles the positional pressure Black has. Things went
downhill quickly.} 25. Re1 (25. Qe2 {was a better defense, keeping the rook out
of d2.}) 25... Ne5 $1 {Black's initiative begins and doesn't let up until the
king is tipped over.} (25... Rd2 26. Re2 {is OK for White.}) 26. Qc7 (26. Qe2
{runs into} Rd2 $1 {and if} 27. Qxd2 Nf3+ $1 {picks up the queen.}) 26... Nf3+
27. Kh1 Rd2 28. Rf1 Ng5 {Precise play from both players, but now White's
position is nearly impossible to hold together.} 29. Be3 {[#]} Rxg2 $1 { The
only move that maintains the edge, but it's a mighty powerful one.} 30. Qc8+
(30. Qxb7 {is the best move according to the silicon beast, with the idea that
after} Nxe4 31. Qxf7+ $1 Qxf7 32. Rxf7 {and White has chances for survival,
though after} Re2 $1 33. Rf3 Rxa2 {I'd suspect Black should win with best
play.}) 30... Kh7 31. Kxg2 (31. Qf5 {would have lasted longer, but after} Rg4
$1 32. Qxg6+ Kxg6 {The ending should be pretty hopeless.}) 31... Qxe4+ { Now
Black picks up the whole world with check.} 32. Kf2 Qf3+ 33. Ke1 Qxe3+ 34. Kd1
Qd3+ $1 {Precise to the last.} 35. Ke1 Nf3+ 36. Kf2 Nxh2 {An impressive win.}
