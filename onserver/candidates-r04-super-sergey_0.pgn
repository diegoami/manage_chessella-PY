{Prior to this game Anand and Karjakin have played against each other 26 times
in different formats of the game - Blitz, Classical, Rapid. There have been
eight decisive results all in the favour of Vishy Anand. Naturally the Indian
ace has a psychological edge when facing the young Russian.} 1. Nf3 {Karjakin
sticks to his policy of beginning the game with 1.Nf3 as he did against Svidler
and Nakamura.} d5 2. e3 $5 {Although not completely silly, this is a highly
unambitious move. In a way it takes away quite a bit of flexibility in from
White's setup and makes d4 lines pretty harmless. Karjakin's natural
inclination was towards avoiding Vishy Anand's home preparation.} Nf6 3. c4 e6
4. b3 Be7 5. Bb2 O-O 6. Nc3 c5 7. cxd5 Nxd5 {The game has transposed into a
well-known position and it looks like we would follow some of the classical
games like the ones played by Botvinnik, Larsen, Smyslov etc. However, Sergey
gives this position his own modern touch!} 8. Qc2 $5 Nc6 9. h4 $5 $146 { [%cal
Gh2h4] The highly interesting novelty. The idea of this move is to prepare Ng5
at some point and force White to weaken his kingside with a pawn move.} b6 10.
a3 (10. Ng5 f5) 10... f5 {Anand tries to be safe and shuts the b1-h7 diagonal.
What he should be really careful about is the fact that he is extending his
position and some of the squares might become weak due to these pawn moves.}
11. Bb5 Bb7 12. Nxd5 exd5 (12... Qxd5 {was definitely a worthwhile
alternative.} 13. Bc4 Qd6 14. Ng5 Bxg5 15. hxg5 Na5 {should not be such a huge
problem for Black.}) 13. d4 {After playing the move h4, suddenly Karjakin
switches to positional chess! Something has not really gone according to his
plan, or has it?!!} Rc8 14. dxc5 bxc5 15. O-O {After the game I was curious as
to why Sergey, who seemed all aggressive and wanted to blow Anand off the
board, had suddenly become positional and played moves like d4 and 0-0. Well
the reason is as simple as Karjakin explains after the game. "I wanted to
provoke him into playing f5 and that's what he did!"} Bf6 (15... f4 16. Bd3 $1
$16) 16. Rfd1 (16. Bxf6 Qxf6 17. Qxc5 Ne5 $44) 16... Ne7 17. Bxf6 Rxf6 18. g3 {
The position is around equal at this point. It is a well know fact that the
side with the isolated or hanging pawns must keep more pieces on the board.
Anand's next move breaks this rule and looks clearly like a positional error.}
Ba6 $6 {[%cal Gb7a6] More the pieces get exchanged, more the c5 and d5 duo
start becoming weak.} 19. Bxa6 Rxa6 20. Qc3 Rb6 21. Rac1 Qd6 $6 {Another
inaccuracy. The queen is not at all well placed on d6. As Sergey shows Ne5 will
threaten moves like Nc4 and Nd3.} 22. Ne5 $1 Rb7 23. Nd3 $1 {And this is what
we were talking about. The hanging pawns become super weak. The c5 pawn
advances and the rest is just pain for the Indian champion.} c4 24. bxc4 Rxc4
25. Qe5 {The queens have to be exchanged.} Qxe5 (25... Qc6 26. Rxc4 dxc4 27.
Nc5 $18) 26. Nxe5 Rxc1 27. Rxc1 $16 {White has a better knight, a better rook,
a better pawn structure and a clear plan of improving his king. The rest as
they say is a matter of technique for a strong player like Karjakin.} g6 28.
