that there is very little he can do, his Knight (on f3) and Bishop (on g3) are
horrible. And I can continue with (my expansion on the kingside) as it
happened in the game. In theory, there are pleasant endgames waiting in the
wings. I may get them or I may not, but that's what I was aiming for”. Was
it the exact point where he realised that he could push for an advantage? “I
tried to keep in mind that my only aim here is not just to equalise! Even if I
(just) keep making moves it is not easy for white. As you can see, at some
point (white) runs out (of moves). (White) can play Bd3-c2, but the other
