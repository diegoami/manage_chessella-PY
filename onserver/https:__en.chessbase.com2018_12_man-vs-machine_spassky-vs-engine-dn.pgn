1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd8 {This move has been used by Carlsen as well as
by ChessBase author IM Andrew Martin, who dedicated a '60 Minutes' DVD to this move.}
4. d4 Bf5 5. Nf3 Nc6 $2 $16 {In the Scandinavian Black tries to keep control
of d5 by pushing c6 and e6. Here this knight development is
suspicious because Black cannot keep the knight on c6.} (5... Nf6 {This was a
good move to keep equality.}) (5... e6 {Also this was a possible move in the
spirit of the Scandinavian, trying to keep d5 under control.}) 6. d5 $1 {
Spassky immediately takes advantage. From this game we can understand there
could be a calculation problem since the engine didn't give d4-d5 the
attention needed, but maybe the real problem was the lack of understanding the
programmers had about the centre, and the consequent failure of the engine to keep it under control. This is also a common feature in beginner games.} Nb4
7. Nd4 e6 $4 {This closes a possible retreat for the bishop, which could help
defend on d7.} (7... Bc8 {Probably the best move to defend, showing Black
made a mistake and is trying to recover.}) 8. Bb5+ Ke7 $4 $18 {If this was a
human player, one would think he panicked...} (8... c6 $5 9. dxc6 bxc6 10. Ba4

slightly more difficult.}) 9. a3 (9. Qe2 $1 Kf6 (9... Nxd5 $4 10. Nxf5+ Kf6 11.
