idea to attack e5 and to threaten Rb5. Black is on the defensive because she
is not fully developed.} e4 $6 {[#]} ({Inviting the white knight into Black's
position. More careful was} 16... Qc7 {and though Black's position is slightly
awkward she should soon be able to bring the white-squared bishop into play -
with good chances for equality.}) 17. Nd4 Nf6 {Maybe Black saw too late that
this move is possible - Black cannot take on d4 because after 19.Rd1 Black's
