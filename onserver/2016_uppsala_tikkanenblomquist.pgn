1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 e6 {This simple developing move which served
Gelfand quite well against Anand in their World Champion match is getting more
and more popular. What is White's strongest move now? Well if you want to
prove something you should inflict structural damages on Black by knocking the
knight out of the board.} 4. O-O Nge7 5. c3 (5. Re1 {Carlsen style (Even
though Carlsen don't want to be labelled any styles...)}) 5... a6 6. Ba4 b5 7.
Bc2 Bb7 {[#] White is at another crossroad. However none of the moves White
has played here are very committal.} 8. Re1 {The most popular choice.} ({
Carlsen choose} 8. Qe2 {against Radjabov in 2009.}) (8. a4) (8. d4) 8... Rc8 9.
a4 {That's how we do it today. The position on the Queen's side has some
similarities with the topic slow rollers in Ruy Lopez and there White wants
Black to play b5 which almost automatically releases the a4-push.} b4 10. d4 {
Tikkanen has obviously prepared something.} (10. d3 $11 {is a cautious
alternative.}) 10... bxc3 11. d5 {[#] This is a position you don't want to
solve at the board. Both guys had their knives sharpened.} cxb2 (11... Nb4 {
Has been played by Ivanchuk and Shirov, but Blomqvist trusts the computer more.
}) 12. Bxb2 Nb4 {[#] Four grandmasters have had this position before, but none
of them played Tikkanen's move. (Komodo10s first choice)} 13. Bc3 {[#] Now it
is time for Black to make a decision. To take or not to take on c2?} Ng6 {
OK, White enjoys a certain compensation due to Black's poor development on th
King's side. And the question is if Black can castle at all? Most probably not,
so, shall Black give the pawn on g7 back in order to develop the Bishop and
when White grabs it put the rook on g8 so that he him self can threat
something?} (13... Nxc2 14. Qxc2 Ng6 15. Qd2 {with the idea Ba5, was a motive
that Hans liked, and perhaps this motive was the cause of later Qd2?!}) 14. Na3
{Sensible, as the c4-square looks attractive. Tikkanen did not like this.} ({
Perhaps an inch better was:} 14. Nbd2 {In some variations the knight might
come handier in the centre even though it is not clear when and how. But the
centre will probably change very soon, and then this will be solved by itself.}
Be7 15. Bxg7 Rg8 16. Bc3 exd5 17. exd5 Nxc2 18. Qxc2 Bxd5 19. Ng5 {White still
has some pressure against Black, and we can see that the knight on d2 looks
little bit more natural than on a3.}) 14... Be7 15. Qd2 $6 {Some kind of
preparation, but it alows castling.} ({Why not the simple} 15. Bxg7 Rg8 16. Bc3
{and White must be somewhat superior because of the King on e8. Concrete moves
might save Black, but a standard evaluation gives White a long term plus, and
besides, White's position is more robust.} {If Black wants to challenge White
with:} exd5 17. exd5 Bxd5 18. Bxg6 (18. Bxb4 Bxf3 19. Qxf3 cxb4 20. Bb3 Rg7 21.
Nc4 {He ends up in a middle game misery. Where only tactics can save him i.e.}
Nh4 22. Qe4 Rxc4 23. Qxc4 Nxg2 24. Qd4 (24. Rxe7+ Qxe7 25. Kh1 Qe5 26. Rg1 {
and Black keeps the things together.}) 24... Kf8 25. Re4 d5 26. Rg4 Bf6 27.
Qxb4+ Be7 28. Qd4 Bf6 $11) 18... Rxg6 19. Nh4 Re6 20. Nf5 Rxe1+ 21. Qxe1 Rc6
22. Rd1 {With some kind of pressure.} (22. Qe5 d6 23. Qh8+ Kd7 24. Qxh7 Bf6))
15... exd5 ({Why not} 15... O-O $15) 16. Bxg7 Rg8 17. exd5 {White is gambling}
(17. Qh6 Nxc2 18. Nxc2 dxe4 19. Ne3 $1 $11 {was mandatory.}) 17... Rxg7 18. d6
Bxf3 $1 19. Qc3 $1 Kf8 20. dxe7+ Nxe7 21. Qxf3 Nec6 $1 {Erik is a true
materialist and here he excells!} 22. Qh3 {White must try something...} Nd4 23.
Bxh7 Qh4 {This one did hurt.} 24. Qxh4 Nf3+ 25. Kf1 Nxh4 26. Be4 d5 27. Rac1
Rc6 28. Nb1 f5 29. Bxd5 Nxd5 {White could have resigned but in this tournament
we have seen mysterious errors, so everything can happen.} 30. Re5 Nf4 31. Rc4
Nfxg2 32. Nd2 Kf7 33. Rcxc5 Rxc5 34. Rxc5 Nf4 35. Nf3 Ne6 36. Ra5 Nxf3 37.
Rxf5+ Ke7 38. Rxf3 Rg4 39. Ra3 a5 40. Ke2 Rh4 41. h3 Nf4+ 42. Kd2 {Here
Blomqvist calculated to move 58.} Rxh3 43. Rxh3 Nxh3 44. Ke3 Kd6 45. f4 Kc5 46.
f5 Ng5 47. f6 Kb4 48. Ke2 Kxa4 49. Kd1 Kb3 50. Kc1 a4 51. Kb1 a3 52. Ka1 Nf3
53. f7 Nd4 54. f8=Q Nc2+ 55. Kb1 a2+ 56. Kc1 a1=Q+ 57. Kd2 Qe1+ 58. Kd3 Qe3# {
We saw a modern game of chess. First we have a innocent looking opening, then
White took up the gauntlet by playing. Black was mentally prepared to defend
and he defended well! White lost track and Black took over. Erik Blomqvist at
his best!} 0-1
