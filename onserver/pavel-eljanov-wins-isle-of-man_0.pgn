a5  8. g4  Na6 { 35 It is absolutely remarkable that Naiditsch chose to enter
this win-at-all-cost line, since it is highly risky, and could easily cost him
heavily.} 9. Be3 {15 This is a pet line of Rodshtein, and one he played at the
Olympiad just recently, defeating GM Saric.} Nc5  (9... Nd7 10. a3 Nb6 11. Rg1

major crossroads here. Black has played successfully, and almost with equal
frequency, 11...a4, 11...Bd7 as in the game, as well as ... cxd5 and ...Nfd7,
or ...Ne8.} 12. g5  Ne8  13. Nb3 {1275 Had White forgotten his theory here? It
isn't that 13.Nb3 is not played, but it is almost never chosen in grandmaster
play. Rodshtein spent over 21 minutes before playing this. Normal is 13.h4.
Perhaps he felt this was the time to step out of the main lines, fearing
Naiditsch's preparation.} cxd5  14. exd5  Na4  15. Nd2  Nxc3  16. bxc3 {4 [#]}
f5 $1 {90 With White's king still in the center, and both his queenside and
kingside badly weakened, it is tome to start the counterattack.} 17. gxf6  Bxf6

aggressive and enterprising play will be rewarded. Correct was ...Qc2 first and
only then ...e3.} 28. fxe3  Qc2  29. Qd4  f4  30. Rxb7 $2 {48 White
hallucinates and it is over. The move was Qxf4 plain and simple.} fxe3  31. Ne4
