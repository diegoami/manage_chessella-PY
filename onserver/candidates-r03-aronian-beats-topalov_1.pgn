1. e4 {It worked for him in game one and Vishy continues with 1.e4.} e5 2. Nf3
Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {Berlin! I wonder how the a-pawn must be feeling at this point
of time. Earlier just about everyone used to pushing it. Now no one really
cares about it and goes for Nf6!} 4. d3 {This seems to be Anand's weapon
against the Berlin in this event.} Bc5 5. O-O d6 6. c3 O-O 7. h3 $5 {A small
change by Anand. In his game against Topalov he had gone Nbd2, whereas here he
plays the little rook pawn move. It has two advantages: 1. it stops Bg4 in the
future, and 2. it gets Caruana out of his preparation.} Ne7 {Caruana sticks to
his plan of transferring his knight to the kingside.} 8. d4 Bb6 9. Bd3 {
Definitely more common is Re1. However, Anand played this move quickly. Caruana
went into a think after this, which meant that he hadn't really revised the
line before the game. The variation with Bd3 is less played than Re1, but it
has been essayed by players like Magnus Carlsen and Vasily Ivanchuk!} (9. dxe5
{leads to absolutely othing for White after} Nxe4 $11) 9... Ng6 (9... d5 {was
Kramnik's reaction against Carlsen. And after} 10. Nbd2 dxe4 11. Nxe4 Nxe4 12.
Bxe4 exd4 13. Qc2 h6 14. a4 $5 {we saw an extremely interesting game develop.})
10. Re1 Re8 11. Qc2 {At this point Anand had used only two minutes of his time
while Caruana down by twenty five minutes. The interesting thing is that Anand
has already played this opening with black against Michael Adams in 2013.} exd4
$146 {Caruana comes up with a new move, but this is not home preparation. It
was played after due thought.} 12. cxd4 c5 {An interesting move by Caruana
trying to fight for the dark squares.} 13. dxc5 (13. d5 Ba5 {leads to a very
odd kind of a Benoni which should be completely fine for Black.}) (13. e5 $5
{is an interesting move. Although both players rejected it after Nd5, it could
be interesting to see a few more moves.} Nd5 { Threatening Nb4.} (13... dxe5
14. dxe5 {looks completely crushing for White as after} Nd7 15. e6 fxe6 16.
Bxg6 $18 {Black is busted.}) 14. Bg5 $1 (14. a3 { might be too slow as after}
cxd4 {Black is completely fine.}) 14... Qc7 { After the game Fabi said that he
was planning to play this move but it wouldn't have been great as White can now
play} (14... Nb4 15. Qc3 Qc7 16. Bb5 $13) (14... f6 $6 15. dxc5 $1 dxc5 16. Nc3
$1 Nxc3 17. exf6 $1 gxf6 18. Bxg6 { with a very strong attack.}) 15. Nc3 $1
{The main idea is to connect the rooks on the first rank.} Nb4 (15... Nxc3 16.
exd6 $1) 16. exd6 $1 $18 {Not an easy move to see from a distance but now the
rook on e8 is undefended.}) 13... Bxc5 14. Nc3 Be6 15. Be3 Qc8 (15... Ne5 $5
{After the game Miroshnichenko suggested this smart move for Black which seems
to equalise immediately.} 16. Nxe5 Bxe3 $1 17. Nxf7 Bxf2+ 18. Qxf2 Bxf7 {This
looks like a much preferable position for Black than was reached in the game.})
16. Bxc5 Qxc5 17. Qd2 Ne5 18. Be2 $1 Nxf3+ 19. Bxf3 {Black has an isolated pawn
on d6 while White is relatively solid. This should give White an edge. However,
it is not so clear as to how White should proceed.} Rad8 20. Red1 $5 {One of
the most difficult questions in the game of chess is where should I place my
rooks. In this position White has many options. The most natural of course
looks to be Rad1, but Red1 also has its point. Vishy would like to put the a
rook on c1.} (20. Rac1 {looks natural. Black could reply with} Qe5) (20. Rad1
{is also answered by} Qe5 21. Qd4 a6 22. Qb4 $14 {when White has an edge.})
20... h5 $5 21. Qd4 Qg5 22. Qd2 ( 22. Qxa7 Bxh3 $132) 22... Qe5 {I asked
Fabiano whether he wanted to play on and that was the reason why he chose Qe5
instead of Qc5. He said his queen was much better placed on e5 than on c5 and
Vishy would not have repeated the position again.} 23. Qe3 $1 {Attacking the a7
pawn and getting ready to double rooks on the d-file.} a6 24. Rd4 Bd7 $5 {The
bishop wasn't doing much on e6. On c6 it would not only control the d5 square
but also attack the one on e4.} 25. Rad1 Bc6 26. g3 Re6 27. Bg2 {White gets
ready to start his expansion with f4. Vishy truly has played really well until
this point.} h4 {[%cal Gh5h4]} 28. gxh4 $1 {[#] An extremely bold move by
Vishy. Usually in chess not many times you will see people taking such a pawn
and accepting doubled rook pawns. However, here it is more important to make
sure that White is getting in f4 and hence this gxh4 move is very flexible and
meets the demands of the position.} (28. g4 $5 {Keeping the pawn structure
intact is definitely an idea. But it can be possible that Vishy was afraid of}
g5 {When f4 is stopped. However, White should at least be a tad better after}
29. Qd2 $14) (28. f4 $2 Qc5 29. g4 $2 Bxe4 $1 30. Nxe4 Nxe4 31. Bxe4 Rde8 $15)
28... Rde8 (28... Nh5 $2 {Trying to keep an eye on the f4 square loses to} 29.
Rd5 $1 Bxd5 30. Rxd5 $18) 29. Bf3 {After the game Vishy thought that this was
extremely clever as he was preparing Bg4.} (29. f4 Qc5 $13 {The e4 pawn would
be falling in this case.}) 29... a5 30. a4 $6 {Anand wants to stop all these
ideas beginning with b5 but this was a crucial loss of time.} (30. Bg4 R6e7
(30... Nxg4 31. hxg4 $16) 31. Rxd6 Nxe4 32. Nxe4 Qxe4 {Should be around
equal.}) (30. a3 {was definitely much better remaining flexible.} b5 31. Bg4 $1
$14) 30... Qc5 31. Qf4 (31. Bg4 R6e7 $11) (31. Rxd6 $5 Qxd6 32. Rxd6 Rxd6 33.
Qc5 Rde6 34. Qxa5 Nxe4 35. Nxe4 Bxe4 36. Bxe4 Rxe4 {might be an edge for White
but will most probably end in a draw.}) 31... Re5 32. R1d3 {Not really sure
what this move is all about, but it keeps up the pressure.} (32. Rxd6 Nxe4 33.
Nxe4 Bxe4 $11) 32... R8e6 33. Kh2 Qb6 34. Rd2 Qd8 35. Qg3 $6 {This lets Caruana
equalise immediately.} (35. h5 $5 Nxh5 36. Bxh5 Rxh5 37. Rxd6 Rxd6 38. Qxd6
Qxd6+ 39. Rxd6 f5 {Black should regain his pawn, but in any case White will
maintain a small edge.}) 35... Bxe4 36. Nxe4 Nxe4 37. Bxe4 Rxe4 38. Rxe4 Rxe4
39. Rxd6 Qxh4 40. Qxh4 {and a draw was agreed. It should be said that Anand
seemed to be slightly better throughout the game, but was never really able to
cash in.} 1/2-1/2
