1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 {I had noticed that Qxd4 is his
favourite continuation in the open Sicilian.} a6 5. h3 {This move seems a bit
strange to me and he played it at least three times. With the help of my
friend GM Andrei Shchekachev, I noticed that I can let the white queen remain
on d4. Otherwise in most of the lines, it will retreat and follow it up by Nd4.
Instead I went for a new kind of formation.} Nf6 6. c4 e6 7. Nc3 Nbd7 {I tried
to play a hedgehog structure with my opponent’s queen on d4.} 8. g4 $5 {
A very aggressive move. Next is g5. I don’t really don’t want to bring my
night to h5.} Qc7 9. g5 Ne5 10. Nh2 $5 {Interesting but a weird place.} Nc6 11.
Qe3 Nd7 12. b3 {I am not sure how good this move is but black the fact is that
white enters into very deep complications .} b5 $3 {There are two choices for
white; take the pawn and play a very complicated series of moves or avoid
complications by not taking the pawn which is worse.} 13. Bb2 $6 {Wrong choice.
} b4 14. Nd1 e5 {Blocking the second bishop and securing the c5 square for my
knight.} 15. Qd2 Nc5 16. Bg2 Be7 17. h4 h6 $5 {I thought I had to play for a
bigger advantage quickly before the knights on d1 and h2 regroup.} 18. Ne3 hxg5
19. Nd5 Qd8 20. Nxe7 Qxe7 21. hxg5 Bb7 {I understood that in the long term the
white king is weaker than black’s. My last move guarantees a very safe place
for my king on the queen side.} 22. O-O-O O-O-O 23. Ng4 Rxh1 24. Rxh1 Ne6 $1
25. Rh7 Rg8 26. g6 fxg6 27. Bh3 $6 (27. Ne3 $1 {Keeps control of the centre
and gives protection for the white king.}) 27... Kb8 28. Nh6 Rf8 29. Bxe6 Qxe6
30. Rxg7 {White took the pawn back but at the price of a very weak king.} Ka8

37. Qxh6 Rxh6 38. Bxd4 exd4 39. Kd3 Rh4 {It’s still not time to relax. I
have to get passed pawns.} 40. f3 Rh2 41. Rxg6 Rxa2 42. f4 Rb2 43. f5 Rxb3+ 44.
Kxd4 Rf3 45. c5 dxc5+ 46. Kxc5 Ka7 47. Kxb4 Bxe4 48. Rf6 Bb7 49. Rf7 Kb6 50.
