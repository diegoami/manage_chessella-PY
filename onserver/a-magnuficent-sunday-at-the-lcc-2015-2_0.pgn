8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {Of course Anish puts his money on the Berlin to defend from the
black side of game one of the rapid tiebreaks.} 9. h3 Ke8 10. Nc3 h5 {Maxime
sank into thought here trying to remember the best setup that would suit him in
this shortened time control.} 11. Ne2 b6 12. Rd1 Be7 13. Bg5 Bb7 14. Bxe7 Kxe7
15. Ned4 Nxd4 16. Nxd4 {White tries to play in an extremely simplified fashion.
But the funny thing about Berlin is that once you try to play very normal moves
Black has his trumps and he tends to come out on top. Like in this case.} c5 $1
(16... g6 {Trying to stop Nf5 won't be the most accurate.} 17. f4 c5 18. Nb5
Rhc8 19. Kf2 {and White is basically a tempo up as compared to the game.}) 17.
Nb5 (17. Nf5+ $6 Ke6 18. Nxg7+ Kxe5 $19 {and the knight is trapped in the
corner.}) 17... Rhc8 $1 {a6 or Bc6 is coming up next, and the knight will be
kicked out.} 18. f4 Bc6 (18... a6 {was also pretty good.} 19. Nc3 Rd8 $15) 19.
Nc3 Ke6 20. Kf2 h4 $1 {Let us try to understand the reasons why Black is better
here. His king is centralized, the pawn on g2 is fixed. Also the bishop on c6
somehow dominates the knight on c3. Because of all these reasons Black is just
better.} 21. a4 Kf5 22. Ke3 (22. Nd5 $1 {It was necessary to make this move if
he wanted to have any chances of equalizing.} Bxd5 23. Rxd5 Kxf4 24. Rd7 $1
Kxe5 25. Rxf7 Rf8 26. Re1+ Kd6 27. Ree7 Rxf7+ 28. Rxf7 g5 $11 {Black should be
very slightly better, but a draw would be the most likely outcome.}) 22... Re8
$1 {A very nice move. Now Nd5 will be met with Rac8 and Nb5 with Re7. Besides
f6 is threatened.} 23. Nd5 Rac8 $1 24. Rd2 f6 {Giri's play is a model game for
anyone who would like to know the reasons why Berlin should be played.} 25. Rf1
fxe5 26. fxe5+ Kg5 $1 (26... Kxe5 { was also possible.}) 27. Nc3 Rxe5+ {Black
wins a pawn and the rest should be just a matter of technique.} 28. Kf2 Rf8+
29. Kg1 Rxf1+ 30. Kxf1 Rf5+ 31. Kg1 Rf4 32. Re2 Kf6 33. b3 a6 34. Nd1 Bd5 35.

onus was now on the Frenchman to win with the black pieces.} 44. axb6 cxb6 45.
