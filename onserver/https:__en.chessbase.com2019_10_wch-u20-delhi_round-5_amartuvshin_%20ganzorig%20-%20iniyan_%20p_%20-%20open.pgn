f5 16. c5 Ng6 $146 17. Rc1 Re7 18. Nb5 a6 19. Na7 {[#] A very interesting
position faced GM Iniyan today, in this King's Indian, a strange knight in a7
invaded his position without asking permission. Let's see how he fought this
incursion and emerged victorious.} Nf4 20. Nxc8 Rxc8 21. Qc2 Rf7 22. cxd6 Nxe2+
{Contrary to what the rule says (do not change your active piece for a bad
bishop within the pawn structure), Iniyan took this decision based on his
practical sense. This bishop stops Black's g4, and getting rid of it will help
Black.} 23. Qxe2 cxd6 24. Rxc8 Qxc8 25. Rc1 Rc7 26. Rf1 $2 {It is not a move
that lose instantly but leaving the open line without fighting is almost never
a good idea.} (26. Rxc7 Qxc7 27. exf5 Nxf5 28. Qe4 $11 {A continuation of this
type was much more natural.}) 26... Rf7 {Strange move that leaves the open
file, perhaps the best idea was something more active like g4.} 27. Rc1 Rc7 28.
Be3 f4 {Iniyan's very important decision, what a ironic position where the
black bishop seems worse, but the good space on the king side will make a
difference.} 29. Rxc7 Qxc7 30. Bf2 Bf6 31. Qd2 Bd8 32. Qc3 Qd7 33. b3 g4 34.
fxg4 Nxg4 $1 35. h3 Nf6 {The e4 pawn is very weak.} 36. Qc4 b5 37. Qc6 {
This move is the last error.} Qxc6 38. dxc6 a5 $1 {This is the move that was
missed by Amatuvshin.} 39. Ba7 Bc7 40. b4 a4 41. Nb2 Nxe4 42. Nxa4 bxa4 43. b5
