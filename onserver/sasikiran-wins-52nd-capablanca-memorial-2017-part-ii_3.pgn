1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 b6 {Nearly
100 games have been played in this position before.} 8. Ne2 {This is not in
computer's first four choices.But for humans this is a very natural move. You
put your pawn on c3 and then expand on the kingside. I had prepared this new
move some time ago and my opponent just fell into this idea of g4 and f5 that I
had worked on. There has been one game played before with this move in 2003 in
Spanish under-16 Championships. But apart from that no one has tried it
before.} g6 9. c3 a5 {This was already too slow.} (9... h5 {Stopping my
kingside play was important.}) 10. g4 {Maybe it's a bit too harsh, but I think
Black's position is already lost here.} Ba6 (10... h5 {he had to play, but
after} 11. gxh5 Rxh5 12. Ng3 Rh8 13. h4 $16 {followed by h5, White has simply
excellent play.}) 11. f5 $1 {When I got in this move I was confident that I
would be able to win this game.} Bxe2 12. Bxe2 {I have the two bishops, more
space, my bishop can also come to b5. His king is stuck in the centre. Overall
if I don't do anything stupid, I should be able to win this position.} Rc8 13.
