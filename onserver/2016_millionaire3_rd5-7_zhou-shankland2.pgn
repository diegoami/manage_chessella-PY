Nc3 h6 41. Ne2 {In spite of the 0.00 evaluation by the engines, the endgame is
still double-edged as either side could win if a misstep is made. If White
becomes too adventurous with his knight, trying to capture b6, the two extra
pawns in the center could be his undoing, while if Black is not careful, White
could infiltrate, and clean up.} {[%tqu "En","Both sides are walking a mutual
highwire act. Here Black has only one move to maintain the balance. What is
it? Tip: work out also why at least a couple of the alternatives would lose.",

some kind of fancy trick? Nope! Taking e4 with the king is the right choice.

the better one?} (43. Ng3 {throws it away.} h5 44. Nxe4+ Kf5 45. Nd6+ Ke5 46.
