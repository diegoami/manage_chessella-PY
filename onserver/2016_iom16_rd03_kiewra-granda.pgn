1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 c6 3. Nd2 Qb6 {The well known Peruvian GM Julio Granda always
prefers the road less travelled. After only a few moves an original position
will be reached.} 4. Nb3 a5 5. a4 d6 6. Nf3 Ne4 7. Be3 Nd7 {The opening has
not been a success for white but no real damage has been done.} 8. g3 Ndf6 9.
Nfd2 Nxd2 10. Bxd2 Be6 11. Ra3 {I must admit it would be hard to play this
"ugly" move instead of the more natural e3 but it is still ok.} (11. e3) 11...

Bb4 16. fxg7 Bxc3+ 17. bxc3 Rg8 18. Nd4 {If you had said this position was
reached in an youth championship of Under-10 players I would have believed you,
but in fact both players have played quite well and with an aim to be original
and creative. Had they not, it would have been easy to keep the position quiet
and dry.} c5 19. Nf3 Qb2 20. O-O Qxc3 21. Qb1 b5 {The Peruvian GM does not
want to defend anything!} 22. axb5 Rxg7 23. Nh4 Kf8 24. b6 Rb8 25. Nf5 Rg6 26.

Kd6 35. Nxc3 Bc6 36. Bxh7 Rxb7 37. h4 c4 {To finish off cleanly Granda plays
c4 to allow his king an entry route to b4} 38. g4 Re7 39. Ra1 Kc5 40. Kf1 Kb4
