{To finish a tough tournament with a win is never easy, as one has to be very
precise at every single step. But Gabriel Sargissian did just that, finding
the cleanest way to score the point and share the 1st place with Fressinet and
Harikrishna.} 42. Rg3 $1 {but what about} Nf2 {? The mate on h1 only looks
scary, since White anihilated very fast all Black's hopes to hold.} 43. Bd6+
Ke8 44. Re3+ {A small example but it shows the strength of the top players,
not allowing any kind of "bad luck" to appear on the board. As for the young
and talented Italian player, I am sure we will hear more from him!} 1-0
