{The first round of any tournament is always hard. Getting into the 'chess
zone', adjusting to the new environment and finding a pleasant rhythm for a
better state of mind takes time. This is the reason why professional chess
players are not big fans of accelerated pairings, preferring an 'easy' start
to get in shape. On paper, 800 rating difference sounds just like that:
showing up for the game should be enough for a point. In reality, a 1700 can
and will throw sand in the 2500 player's gears. And that's what happened in
Crete. The Indian GM and top seed got even a White when facing his 'modest'
first round opponent but that didn't save him from trouble. You can scroll
through the game underneath to see how a young talent can mess up an
experienced opposition.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. c3 a6 5. Ba4 Bg7 6.

Bxb2 32. Rb1 {After White got a slight advantage, Black managed to equalize,
take over and eventually agree a draw (on the good side of it) in the endgame.
If some of us were surprised by the outcome, Stany kept his cool and optimism,
mentioning that clearly the young man he was playing should not be sitting on
a 1700 rating at all! Georgios plays way better than his elo shows and that
could be seen in his next games as well.} 1/2-1/2

{Konstantinos was not very pleased with his tournament play but after checking
his games I must say he is a daring, inventive player, with sometimes a bit
unorthodox moves yet interesting to go through. Definitely not a boring chess
character and he came back to the third place too, particularly after losing
in Round 4 against the tournament Nemesis, the 1700 rated Georgios Papadakis.
The opening phase didn't go well for Georg, Austrian IM, and this was the
moment when drastic decisions and tough calculations must be made. How would
you continue?} 18. Nf3 {Brings another piece towards the black king but it
also brings havoc in White's position. Instead,} (18. exf4 {was the way to
