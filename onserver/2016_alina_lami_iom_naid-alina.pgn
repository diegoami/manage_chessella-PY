{This is my last game in the tournament, of which I shouldn't be as embarrased
as I felt over there. Once back in the room, I turned on the laptop, the
engine, put the game in and to my horror, I saw how 'easily' I was winning...
not once, but twice, with the exact same idea.} 31... Qc5 {is what I played,
thinking that I should have some Qc3+, just in case my king suddenly gets
exposed.} ({The cool engine suggests the simple} 31... gxh4 {where things like}
32. Nc6 Rb7 33. g5 fxg5 34. e5 {simply don't work due to} h3 ({but not} 34...
dxe5 $2 {in view of} 35. d6+ Kg7 36. Nxe5) 35. e6 {brings nothing} Bxc6 36.
dxc6 Qxc6 37. e7+ Kg7) 32. Nc6 Rb6 33. Kb1 {White also refuses to take on g5,
for the same obscure reasons as Black.} h6 {missing the 2nd moment of taking
on h4 and inviting White to take on g5, after Which Black's hopes vanished and
the game soon ended in a draw.} (33... gxh4 {was again possible} 34. Rh1 Qf2 {
and Black infiltrates on the Black squares, enjoying the big advantage the 2
extra pawns bring too.}) 34. hxg5 hxg5 35. Rc1 Qe3 36. Qxe3 fxe3 37. Nd4 {
etc. I prefer this "etc" instead of the moves I played which were a desperate
attempt to keep the game going. Luckily I didn't go too far and a draw was
agreed.  Now I look back at it in a less emotional way and I can finally
forgive myself for not seeing such easy moves. It was not an obvious way, no
matter how bull's eye it does look to you (and me) at the moment. Somehow the
battle was taking place in the middle of the board, during the game I also had
to pay attention to the safety of my king, so psychologically, opening it up
with moves like gxh4 was out of my radar.   This is just an illustration on a
smaller scale on how a human mind works, so we shouldn't be shocked by the
'unacceptable' errors which happen on a higher level and that are pointed out
by the computers.  If we sit down and think, winning is never easy.} 1/2-1/2

{I saw and heard a few comments regarding this game, according to which White
missed a great defence and spoiled half a point. But that is placing things
out of perspective. Naiditsch played a beautiful game, got the advantage and,
in his usual attacking style, wanted to finish off with fireworks.} 27... e3 {
Powerful and practically strong too.} ({The better alternative which the
computers shout is} 27... Qc2 {but after} 28. Qxf5 {one must have seen
beforehand} Ref8 $1 {Looks so 'simple' but it is in fact counter-intuitive, to
move away a rook which is strategically placed on the e-file, attacking the
poor white king. The idea behind it is to prevent White from taking on b7,
thus to have the f6 knight protected.} (28... Qxc3 {brings nothing} 29. Rg3 e3
30. Rxe3 Rxe3+ 31. fxe3 Qxe3+ 32. Kd1)) 28. fxe3 Qc2 {Looks better now but
only optically.} 29. Qd4 f4 $1 {You must know by now that chess doesn't always
have to be 'correct' to bring one points.} 30. Rxb7 {After a great deal of
pressure throughout the entire game, White didn't find an 'easy' defense:} (30.
Qxf4 $1 {and if} Re4 31. Qf3 (31. Qg3) 31... Qd3 32. Rg3 Ree7 33. e4 {Ideal
would be to first look at the game with a human mind and only afterwards check
with an engine. Unfortunately, it rarely happens these days.}) 30... fxe3 31.
Ne4 e2 (31... e2 {and White resigned because of} 32. Rxf7 Qb1+ 33. Kxe2 Rxe4+)
