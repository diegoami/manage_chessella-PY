O-O 9. dxc5 Qa5 10. O-O-O b6 {While checking Alireza's games, I was really
impressed by his handling of the white pieces lately. So I decided that for
this game, rather than just defending, I would give myself some winning
chances as well.} 11. Bb5 (11. cxb6 $143 axb6 {opening the a file looks quite
dangerous for White}) 11... Nb4 12. a3 bxc5 {the point of Black's previous play
} 13. Bxd7 {after a long think my opponent chose the most principled reply} (

trying to get mated}) 14... cxb4 15. Nxd5 exd5 16. Bxd7 Bxd7 17. Qxd5 Qxd5 18.
Rxd5 Bc6 19. Ra5 Rfc8 20. Rxa7 Bf8 {and here a draw was agreed; even with two
pawns down Black has a lot of compensation thanks to his very active pieces})
13... Bxd7 14. axb4 cxb4 15. Nb1 Rfc8 {Being caught off guard, several strong
players with White couldn't believe this wasn't a mere bluff. Actually Black
is more than fine as he will be making fast progress on the queenside and
White's piece up will prove to be no more than a consolation prize.} 16. Nd4 (
16. f5 {trying to have some play against Black's king fails miserably after}
Ba4 17. Nd4 Rxc2+ 18. Nxc2 Rc8 $19 {once White's queen leaves the scene, her
king will be at Black's queen mercy.}) 16... Qa2 (16... Qa1 $5 {was another
tempting option that worked very well in the following game} 17. Qd3 a5 18. f5

17... Ba4 {was actually what I had prepared before but} 18. Qd3 {was what
really worried me during the game} f6 $3 {Of course the machine immediately
realizes this is completely winning as after the d4 N will be removed, White's
position will fall to pieces. For me f6 was rather counterintuitive, to say
the least.} (18... Rxc2+ 19. Nxc2 Rc8 20. Rd2 b3 21. Nc3 $16 {and White is
still alive and well})) 18. Rhf1 a5 19. Nxf5 Bxf5 (19... Bf8 $2 {I would

pinning his hopes on this move; however} Rxc2+ $1 {is crushing} 22. Kxc2 Rc8+

same cannot be said about his counterpart who will not survive for long.})

play could be blocked} a3 23. bxa3 Bxa3+ 24. Nxa3 Qa1+ $1 {this was an idea I
missed} 25. Nb1 Ra2 26. Rf2 Rc2+ $1 (26... Rxd2 27. Rfxd2 $13) 27. Qxc2 bxc2
28. Kxc2 Rb8 $17 {finally the clumsy Nb1 leaves the scene}) 22. e6 $1 {my
talented opponent finds a very strong defensive resource, trying to muddy the
waters} f6 $1 {the right decision to block White's play. However, now I will
no longer have the vital Bg5+ in some lines.} (22... fxe6 {was my initial idea
but after} 23. Qe3 {I realized White also becomes quite active} (23. Rg5 $2
Bxg5 24. Qxg5 Ra7 {simply kills the fun})) 23. Qd3 b3 24. Rf2 {and we got to
the the most important moment of the game. If I don't find something now,
White is ready to repel Black's attack with simple moves.} Ra4 $1 {after a
very long thought I finally hit on the right idea - if I eliminate White's
strongest defender I can finally break through} (24... Qa1 {doesn't quite work
as after} 25. bxa3 Bxa3+ 26. Kd2 Rxc2+ 27. Ke1 $16 {White's king runs away}) (

ended my calculation here and concluded that at least in practical play it is
much easier to play with Black}) 27... Bxf2 $2 {a bad miss spoiling it all. I
saw in advance 28...Qa1 which looked promising and didn't bother to check for
other candidates} (27... axb2+ 28. Qxb2 Bxf2 $19 {I completely missed this
simple winning idea}) 28. Qxf2 Qa1 29. e7 $2 {with little time left my
opponent also goes wrong} (29. Rxd5 a2 30. Qf5 g6 31. Qe4 {and because of the
e6 pawn Black cannot make much progress. Also White has his problems so a draw
here would have been a normal result}) 29... a2 30. e8=Q+ (30. Qf5 Rxc3+ {
could be what he missed} (30... axb1=Q+ 31. Qxb1 Rxc3+ $4 32. Kd2 {and White
even wins}) 31. Kd2 Qxb2+ 32. Ke1 Re3+ $19) 30... Rxe8 31. Qf5 d4 {This
important victory brought me a one point lead in the tournament. Then I
decided to push my luck and lost the 8th round with White against Gawain Jones
making the tournament situation a little more entertaining.} 0-1

{Seems that Black became the new White in Reykjavik, which reminds me of the
#MoveForEquality message: colour doesn't grant advantage. If in the previous
7th round Costica won a hot point with Black, R8 brought him a cold zero with
White.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {The never ending discussion of the
principled Grunfeld, opening which was employed by both players with both
colours. As a GM friend of mine would say:"just pick a line against this
Grunfeld and hope that your opponent remembers less than you".} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5.
e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Nf3 c5 8. h3 {A rather rare line which was considered
to be closed, got resurrected as of recently, promising White to catch Black
off guard and thus hoping to get the advantage. The move h3 is very logical,
stopping Bg4, but also it could slow down White's typical attack which starts
with h4, followed by h5.} O-O 9. Be3 Qa5 10. Bd2 {Quite a few strong GMs
tested this line and with good results but mostly in Rapid and Blitz.} e6 11.
