superb move may seem paradoxical at first sight, but is based on a deep

understanding of the position. Nakamura explained that he felt this was

the best way to pose White problems, instead of continuing in 'automatic'.}

({ The more obvious} 13... Bg7 {doesn't offer much and certainly doesn't

ask too many questions of White. For example,} 14. Be2 Qa5 (14... O-O

{would lead to problems after} 15. g4 $1) 15. Ra3 Rc7 {Just to illustrate.}

16. O-O O-O 17. g4 {is still not clear.}) 14. Ra3 $2 {Nakamura commented

he thought this move was inaccurate in his view as it will turn out to

be a waste of time. After lines with ...Bh6 Rb3 (the whole point of Ra3

after all) and ...Nc5, the rook will just find itself harassed.} f5 15.

White continues} 16. Qd3 Ne7 (16... fxe3 $4 { is just mate after} 17.

if not worse, it doesn't make White's life difficult either.}) 16. f3

Bh6 $1 17. g4 $2 {White was already worse, and clearly did not want to

wait and be steamrolled so chooses to take his fate into his hands and

force the issue. This backfires almost immediately though.} Bxe3 18. Qxe3
