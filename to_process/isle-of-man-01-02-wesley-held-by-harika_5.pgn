{The knight on e8 needs to be activated and g7 looks like the natural

square. Overall it seems like White is better here because of the space

he has and the free flowing development. Black on the other hand is solid

but cramped.} 18. Bd3 (18. Rad1 Ng7 19. Rf4 {with the idea of Rc4 is a

possible idea.}) 18... Bd8 19. Ne4 Bxb6 20. Qxb6 Qd8 {Hou Yifan looks

to exchange the queens against her young opponent...} 21. Qe3 { ...but

the 11-year-old wants to attack!} Bxe4 $1 {You can bank on the World Champion

to make the right long term decisions. The knight on e4 was a dangerous

guy and it had to be taken out.} 22. Qxe4 Qc7 23. a5 (23. Ra3 { with the

idea of Rc3 or Rb3 would have maintained the balance. As it happens in

the game, slowly and steadily Praggnanandhaa loses the thread of the game.})
