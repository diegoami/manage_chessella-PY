{To outprepare a player like Wesley So is simply amazing! Wesley is known

for his high class preparation and Harika was able to surpass that. Speaks

volumes about the hard work done by the India number two.} 1. e4 c5 2.

(8... hxg5 9. fxg5 $16 {is already better for White.}) 9. Nf3 Bd6 {Gelfand

has played this twice against Adhiban and Guseinov.} 10. Nh4 Bb8 {Once

again following Gelfand.} 11. Ng6 d5 $1 (11... Re8 $6 12. Nxf4 $14 {And

White has a firm grip over d5.}) 12. exd5 fxg6 {Harika plays the obvious

move and it is clearly better than what Gelfand did.} ({Gelfand's choice

was} 12... Bg4 $2 13. Qd2 (13. dxc6 $1 b5 14. Qd2 bxc4 15. Nxf8 $16) 13...

could have definitely played on here.} 19. Kh1 Nf2+ 20. Kg1 Ng4+ 21. Kh1

Rxb8 22. c7 Ra8 {At first sight this position is not so easy to assess.

The pawn on c7 looks dangerous. But truth be told it is firmly blockaded

right now. Rd1 is not possible due to Nf2 and Ne3 is on the cards. Well,

overall Black is better here, but I don't blame Harika settling for a

draw against her nearly 300+ rating point opponent. In any case the position

should be objectively equal, but Wesley has to find some really difficult

ideas.} 23. h3 Ne3 24. Qe2 Nxc4 25. Rd1 Qe5 26. Qxe5 Nxe5 27. Rd8 $44

{White has decent compensation and maybe the position is just drawn but

Black can play on.}) 19. Kh1 Nf2+ 20. Kg1 Nh3+ 21. Kh1 {A great result

for the Indian player who snatched a half point from the man in form.}

1/2-1/2
