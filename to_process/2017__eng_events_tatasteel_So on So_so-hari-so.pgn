c4  c5  5. Nc3  d5  6. d4  cxd4 { 
} 7. Nxd4  dxc4  ({Wesley mentions that he felt the really
testing move was} 7... e5 {Indeed the database shows the strongest game as
being from 2011 between Fischdick vs Schlick. (Yes, those are really the names)
, which Black won.}) 8. Qa4+ {( 833s)} Nbd7  9. O-O  O-O { }

exd6  13. a4  a6  ({I thought} 13... Be6 {was possible.
I'm not sure it works. For example,} 14. Nxe6 fxe6 15. Rxd6 {This is one
variation I saw.} Rad8 16. Rxe6 Kf7 {and somehow this rook is under pressure.
So I have to move here:} 17. Re3 Nbd5 18. Nxd5 Nxd5 19. Rf3+ Ke8 {[%csl Rb2]
and now I am a pawn up, but he's got some pressure on b2, so I can't move my
bishop away.} 20. Rxf8+ Kxf8 {Probably much better for me, but it is one
possibility.}) 14. Bf4 {  I didn't try to recapture my pawn right away
and instead hinder his development.} d5  (14... Ne8 15. Rac1 a5 16.
Ndb5 Bd7 17. Bxd6 Nxd6 18. Rxd6 Bc6 19. Bxc6 bxc6 20. Rxc6 Rab8 21. Rc5 Rfd8

Nc4 Ba1 35. Nbd6+ Kg7 36. Rb7+ Kg8 {1-0 (55) Kramnik,V (2783)-Nepomniachtchi,I
(2720) Dortmund 2015}) 15. a5  Nbd7  16. Rac1 {  Another
point of Rc1 is that it asks Black where he will play his awkward knight on d7.
16...Nc5 is not possible due to 17. Bd6. By the way, here he (Harikrishna) had
less than 20 minutes left, so he is in some time trouble already.} ({After} 16.
Nxd5 Nxd5 17. Bxd5 Ne5 {I can win a pawn, but then he completes his
development.} 18. Bxe5 Bxe5 19. Bxc4 Bg4 {Now White is better, but it is not
so easy to convert.}) 16... Rd8  17. Bc7  Re8  18. Bd6 {
 } ({After} 18. Nxd5 Nxd5 19. Bxd5 {he once again has the idea} Ne5) 18...
Ne5  {I was attracted to} 19. Bxd5 $1 {because after} Nxd5 { 
Taking is forced or I will play Bg2 and he will be completely paralyzed.} ({
He probably didn't play} 19... Rd8 {in view of} 20. Bxb7 Bxb7 21. Bxe5) 20.
Nxd5 {  the knight is hitting b6, c7, and e7.} Bg4 $1 {  A very strong
move. I have to be very careful here.} 21. Rd2 {  I wasn't too happy with
this move, but maybe it works, since I could not see anything refuting it.} ({
For example, after} 21. Nc7 {he plays} Nd3 $1 {and it is really really tricky.
I can probably equalize with} 22. exd3 ({If I were to blunder with} 22. Rxc4 $2
Nxb2 23. Nxe8 Rxe8 {and most of my pieces and pawns are hanging.})) (21. f3 $2
{would be a serious mistake because of} Nd3 $1 {[%csl Rd4][%cal Rg7d4,Rd4g1]
and here the knight on d4 is threatened to be captured with check.}) 21... Red8
{(319 s) The next moves are forced due to the threat of Nc7 or Nb6.} ({During
the game I worried about} 21... c3 $6 {which forces} 22. Rxc3 {due to the
possible ...Nc4, but after} Nc6 ({After} 22... Red8 23. Nb6 Rxd6 24. Nxa8 {
I have} Nc6 25. e3) 23. Nxc6 Bxc3 {White just takes back with} 24. bxc3 {
since now after} bxc6 25. Nf6+ Kg7 26. Nxe8+ Rxe8 {so I was probably just
imagining things.}) 22. Nb6  Rxd6  ({You wouldn't want to play} 
22... Ra7) 23. Nxa8  Nc6  24. Nf3  Rxd2  25. Nxd2 {
 } Bxb2  26. Rxc4  Bxe2  27. Re4  Bd3  28.
Re3 {  I still wasn't sure I was winning due to his powerful bishops.} Nb4
$2 {  A serious mistake.} ({Instead Black should play something like} 
28... Bf5 29. Rb3 Bf6 30. Rxb7 Nxa5 31. Rb6 Bc3 {and the point is that Black
really needs to keep the bishop pair at all costs. For example, and endgame
like} 32. Nb3 Nxb3 33. Rxb3 Bf6 34. Rb6 Kg7 35. Rxa6 {and this endgame could
easily be a draw, as long a White is unable to exchange his knight for one of
the bishops.}) 29. Nb6 {  There is a small trap here.} Bd4  ({
Here he would be forced to let one of his bishops be exchanged for a knight
after} 29... Bc1 30. Nbc4 {with the idea of Re1.}) 30. Re7  Nc6 { }
31. Rxb7  Nxa5  32. Rd7  Nc6  33. Nb3  Bf5 {
 } ({Black clearly felt that after} 33... Bxb6 34. Rxd3 {he is technically
lost, but it had to be more resistant than the game move, which just drops a
piece.}) 34. Rxd4  Nxd4  35. Nxd4  Bd3  36. Kg2 {
 } Kf8  37. Kf3  Ke7  38. Ke3  Bf1  39.
