1. e4 {(3s)  Caruana has been in "Giri" gear so far in this tournament. In
the last round of the Sinquefield cup, he meets the very same Mr. Giri, who has not been in good shape these days.} e5 {(3s)} 2. Nf3 {(4s)} Nc6 {(3s)} 3. Bb5 {
(5s)} a6 {(3s)} 4. Ba4 {(3s)} Nf6 {(3s)} 5. O-O {(6s)} Nxe4 {(3s) The Open
Spanish, It probably came as a surprise to Caruana.} 6. d4 {(5s)} b5 {(2s)} 7.

Be7 10. Rd1 O-O 11. c4 bxc4 12. Bxc4 Bc5 13. Be3 {is the most common way to
play the Open Spanish.}) 10. Rd1 {(103s)} Nxb3 {(12s)} 11. cxb3 {(285s)  A rare
choice after some thoughts. Caruana is more interested in opening the c-file than
a-file.} Be7 {(12s)} 12. Nc3 {(260s)} O-O {(126s)} 13. Be3 {(190s)} Qd7 {(177s)
} 14. h3 $146 {(290s)  This is a novelty according to my database.} Rad8 {
(130s)} 15. Rd2 $5 {(494s)  Caruana has some interesting things in mind: he
goes directly for the d5 pawn and shows no interest in occupying the c-file.}
f6 $2 {(547s)  Giri is too optimistic here, he does not think that Caruana's
idea is dangerous.} (15... Qc8 {is preferable to what he did in the
game.} 16. Rad1 h6 17. Nxd5 Rxd5 18. Rxd5 Bxd5 19. Rxd5 Nb4) 16. Rad1 $1 {
(1439s)  A deep concept!} Nxe5 {(673s)} (16... fxe5 17. Nxd5 Bxd5 18. Rxd5 Qxd5
19. Rxd5 Rxd5 20. Qc2 Rd6 21. Nd2 {is also worse for Black.}) 17. Nxe5 {(18s)}
fxe5 {(8s)} 18. Nxd5 {(3s)  Caruana believes that his queen and bishop are
stronger than Black's two rooks and bishop in this position.} Bxd5 {(133s)} 19.
Rxd5 {(6s)  Having seen the game, I would have gone for slightly worse but
defendable:} Qxd5 {(86s)} (19... Qe6 20. Rxd8 Rxd8 21. Rxd8+ Bxd8) 20. Rxd5 {
(5s)} Rxd5 {(2s)} 21. Qc2 {(915s)} c5 {(631s)} 22. g3 {(44s)} Kh8 {(840s)} 23.
h4 {(150s)  After some forced moves we see Caruana's deep idea: White can
improve his position in here while Black has to suffer bitterly and wait.} Rfd8
{(623s)} 24. Qe4 {(433s)} h6 {(175s)} 25. Kg2 {(170s)  White's king is safe and
going to be very active. The black king is weak and White's idea is to simply push
g4-g5.} Bf6 {(41s)} 26. Kh3 {( 275s)} h5 {(645s)} 27. a4 {(78s) Unnecessary
but harmless.} Rd3 {(304s)} 28. axb5 {(382s)} axb5 {(8s)} 29. Qg6 {(26s)} e4 {
( 297s)  Giri gets to activate his pieces but his king is weak.} 30. Qxh5+ {
(118s)} Kg8 {(7s)} 31. Qf5 {(749s)} Bxb2 {(195s)} 32. Qxe4 {(27s)} c4 {(90s)} (

happy the tournament is over.} 1-0
