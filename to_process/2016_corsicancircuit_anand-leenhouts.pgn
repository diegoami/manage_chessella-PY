} a6 { Leenhouts goes for the Taimanov Variation
of the Sicilian.} 7. Qf3 $5 { The move Qf3 is becoming quite
popular recently. The idea is to put the queen on g3 and prepare 0-0-0.} d6 {

 13. g5  Nd7  14. f4 {[%emt 0:
01:15]} Rb8 { It's an interesting position as White has expanded
on the kingisde and Black has counterplay down the b-file. But b3 will block
out Black's attack, while White's offensive is not so easy to prepare against.}
15. Qg3  d5  16. f5 $6  (16.

better idea for Black.} (16... Qxg3 17. hxg3 {is better for White.}) 17. Qh3 {

in a rapid game with the king in the center, it doesn't look a very secure
position.}) 19. Qg2  Qa5  20. Bd2 {[%emt 0:00:

practical decision. Black is put under pressure. True he is a piece up, but it
is extremely difficult to find the right moves.} O-O $2 { This
is like jumping into the fire.} (24... Qc5 $15) 25. Qg3  (25.

strong attack with h5. This is all over.} Bb7  29. h5 {[%emt 0:

the rook?","","","h5g6","",10]} 30. hxg6  Bxh1
