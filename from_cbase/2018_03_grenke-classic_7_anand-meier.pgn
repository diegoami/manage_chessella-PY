1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. g3 {White makes a passable effort
to turn a French into something resembling a Catalan (a description that could
also be applied to a certain well-known grandmaster!) It goes without saying
that 5.Nf3 is the main move.} Be7 6. Nf3 Ngf6 7. Qe2 Nxe4 8. Qxe4 Rb8 $1 {
Very Catalan.} ({We have already almost left the realm of praxis; the only
precedent continued} 8... Nf6 9. Qe2 b6 10. Bg2 Bb7 11. c3 O-O 12. O-O Qc8 13.
Re1 c5 14. Be3 c4 15. Ng5 $6 {and was promptly agreed drawn in Rigo,J-Somlai,L
Hungary 1994; the main problem with this is that Black has an extremely good
structure after} Bxg2 16. Kxg2 b5 $15) 9. Bg2 b5 10. O-O O-O 11. Rd1 Bb7 12.
Qe2 {Development is more or less complete the way it was destined to be after
White's 5th move.} Nf6 {Black now drifts just a tiny bit.} (12... Bd5 13. c3
Qc8 $11 {was more economical: Black wants to play ...c5 within the next few
moves. Possibly ...Qb7, ...a6, ...Rbc8, ...c5.}) 13. c3 a6 14. a4 Bd5 (14... b4
15. c4 $14 {is awkward since Black has no means of arranging ...c5; as an
inveterate player of 1.d4 b5 as Black I have a better-than-average
understanding of these positions!}) 15. Ne5 {One of several ways to cement an
advantage.} (15. axb5 axb5 16. Bg5 {was a perfect Catalan solution; White
wants Bxf6 and b4, with a significant advantage.} h6 17. Bxf6 Bxf6 18. b4 $14 {
Black lacks any sort of play and must wait patiently for White pieces to begin
crawling into his weak dark squares.}) (15. Bf4 Bb3 16. Re1 $14 {is simple and
good.}) 15... Bxg2 16. Kxg2 Qd5+ 17. Qf3 Qxf3+ 18. Kxf3 Bd6 19. axb5 $6 (19.
Be3 $5 {seems more accurate to me (though not the engine): the idea is that
Black will probably need to take on e5 anyway, so we should pick the best
route for our bishop in the aftermath of that.} Bxe5 (19... Rfe8 20. Nc6 Rb7
21. axb5 axb5 22. Ra6 Nd5 23. Rda1 $14 {looks even more uncomfortable}) 20.
dxe5 Nd5 21. axb5 Rxb5 (21... axb5 22. Ra6 $14) 22. Rxa6 Rxb2 23. c4 (23. Rc6
$5 $14) 23... Nb6 24. Bxb6 cxb6 25. Rd7 $14 {There is still work to be done
because White has more active rooks.}) 19... axb5 20. Bg5 Bxe5 21. dxe5 Nd5 $1
$11 {Now Black wants both ...c5 and ...Ra8, and White can't really stop both.}
22. Ra6 c5 23. Be3 Rfc8 24. Rda1 h5 25. Ra7 c4 26. Rd7 b4 $1 {Black uses the
White king position to make time for his counterplay.} 27. Bd4 (27. Raa7 bxc3
28. bxc3 Nxc3 29. Rxf7 Rf8 $1 $11 {is the point, and White could easily find
himself worse soon.}) 27... bxc3 28. bxc3 Rb3 (28... Rd8 $11 {was possible if
Black had anticipated what was about to happen...}) 29. Rxd5 $5 {An ambitious
sacrifice, and one which impressed me quite a lot.} exd5 30. Kf4 Rbb8 31. Kg5 (
31. Ra5 $1 Rd8 32. Ra7 $44 {seems called for; Black's rooks can't easily get
in, so he has to resort to harassing the White rook in order to maintain the
balance.}) 31... Ra8 32. Re1 Rc6 33. f4 $6 {Now Black gets in, and only he can
be better.} (33. Rb1 $1 $44 {was still interesting}) 33... Ra2 34. h3 Rd2 35.
f5 Rd3 36. Kf4 h4 37. e6 Kf8 38. gxh4 fxe6 39. Ra1 exf5 40. Kxf5 Rxh3 (40...
Kg8 $5 $17 {is not a bad try, but it could be a hard move 40 to make.}) 41.
Ra8+ Ke7 42. Ra7+ Ke8 43. Ke5 Rxh4 44. Kxd5 Rg6 45. Bxg7 {White forces a draw.
A shame, because his concept was a bold one. Nevertheless, in essence this was
a typical modern game of chess, played on small margins, outside the realm of
opening theory.} 1/2-1/2
