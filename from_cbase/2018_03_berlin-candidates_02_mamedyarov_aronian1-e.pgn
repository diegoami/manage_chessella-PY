Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Nf3 c6 10. g3 {[#] A new more. In previous games White -
including Mamedyarov himself - preferred 10.e3. With a reason. Fianchettoing
the bishop neglects the queenside a bit.} Nd7 11. Bh3 b6 12. cxd5 cxd5 13. Qc6
Rb8 14. O-O {[#] Now the game ends with a short but entertaining skirmish.} Rd8
