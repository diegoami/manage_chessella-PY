1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. a3 {Introduced into
tournament practice in the 1990's, this little move shows White's ambition
to build up a big center by preventing the black bishop from coming to b4.} Be7
{The d7-d5 break can be delayed.} ({In the past Anand and some members of his
coaching staff relied on} 6... d5 7. cxd5 exd5 8. Bg5 Bc5 9. e3 Bxd4 {which is
a dull but reliable way to equalize.}) 7. e4 ({Carlsen-Gelfand, 2009 saw a
different plan:} 7. g3 Qb6 8. Nf3 O-O 9. Bg2 Rd8 10. O-O d5 11. cxd5 exd5 {
the resulting position looks like it came from the Tarrasch Defense, possibly
with an extra tempo for Black thanks to White's Nf3-d4-f3.}) 7... O-O 8. Nf3 {
Normally White wouldn't retreat with that knight [#]} ({but} 8. Be2 d5 {
is known to be equal.}) 8... Qa5 $5 {Still a relatively fresh idea. Black
insists on his central break.} ({A Hedgehog-like formation can be reached via
the standard} 8... Qc7 9. Be2 b6 10. O-O Bb7 {Anand had this position with
Black against Vallejo back in 2005!}) 9. Bd2 {I'm rather surprised with this
one.} ({One would think the endgame up a pawn after the semi-forced} 9. Bd3 d5
10. exd5 exd5 11. cxd5 Nxd5 12. Bxh7+ Kxh7 13. Qxd5 Qa6 14. Bg5 Be6 15. Qb5 {
would be right up Carlsen's alley.}) 9... Qh5 10. Be2 d5 {So, the break goes
through.} 11. cxd5 exd5 12. exd5 Nxd5 13. O-O {[#]} ({Black absolutely doesn't
mind the split pawns after} 13. Nd4 Qe5 14. Nxc6 bxc6 {as his pawn formation
provides support to his Nd5, as seen in Huzman-Timofeev, 2016 and
Inarkiev-Gelfand 2017}) 13... Nf6 $5 {A novelty and improvement from Vishy,
which was rather predictable.} ({We talked about the c6-pawn in the note above,
but here things take a bit of a different shape after} 13... Rd8 14. Nd4 Qg6
15. Nxd5 Rxd5 16. Nxc6 bxc6 17. Bf3 {as White got himself a free ride in
Wojtaszek-Borisek, 2015. Naturally, Carlsen wouldn't mind a repeat of such a
scenario, but this being a Wojtaszek game made it very unlikely to escape a
careful examination in Anand's lab.}) 14. Nd4 Qc5 15. Nxc6 Qxc6 16. Bf3 {
White's only hope in this dry desert type of position is the pressure against
b7, but Black's next takes care of that.} Qa6 $1 17. Re1 Be6 18. Qe2 Qxe2 19.
Nxe2 Bg4 $1 20. Bxg4 Nxg4 {Dead equal. One last thing left to do was to honor
the 30-move rule.} 21. h3 Ne5 22. Nf4 Nc6 23. Nd5 Bd6 24. Bc3 f6 25. Rad1 Rad8
26. Rd2 Kf7 27. Red1 Bb8 28. Kf1 Rfe8 29. Nb4 Rxd2 30. Rxd2 Bf4 31. Rd1 Rd8 32.
Rxd8 Nxd8 33. Ke2 Bd6 34. Nc2 Nc6 35. Nd4 Nxd4+ 36. Bxd4 a6 37. Kd3 Ke6 38. Be3
Kd5 39. f3 b5 40. Bd2 f5 41. Be1 g6 42. Bd2 Be7 43. Be1 Bd6 44. Bd2 Be7 45. Be1
1/2-1/2
