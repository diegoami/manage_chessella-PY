1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 b5 6. Bb3 Bc5 7. c3 d6 {Black
should play this sooner or later.The alternative is essentially ...d5, which
is double-edged in the Italian and probably borderline suicidal now Black has
played ...b5.} 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 {We will not be getting a repeat of
the various 'draw lines' Anand has played which involve sacrifices on g5
against a castled king, and then perpetual check...} Ba7 (10... Bb6 {may keep
marginally more options open, including contesting the a-file 'properly'.} 11.
Nbd2 O-O 12. Qe2 Ne7 {and now} 13. d4 Ng6 $5 $132 {was an interesting and
ultimately successful pawn sacrifice in Alekseev,E-Predke,A Kaliningrad 2015})
11. Nbd2 Na5 12. Bc2 Nh5 {We are now in new territory, and Black is playing
extremely inventively. However, Anand is not to be outdone.} 13. a4 $5 {
Highlighting a problem with ...Ba7, but at the same time committing to playing
the sacrifice that follows. White is playing maximalist chess.} (13. b4 Nc6 14.
a4 $132 {might have been a more normal way to play}) 13... b4 14. cxb4 Nc6 15.
b5 Nb4 16. Nc4 {White played all these moves nearly instantly.} (16. O-O $6 {
may be possible, but is a bit wet and White is not having the fun after} Nxg3
17. hxg3 h5 $44) 16... Nxg3 17. hxg3 g4 {Black commits!} (17... axb5 18. axb5
Bxf2+ $2 {does not work immediately as Black's knight lacks proper access to
d4.} 19. Kxf2 Rxa1 20. Qxa1 Nxc2 21. Qa4 $1 $16) (17... Bc5 $44 {was still
possible, looking for compensation- I am reasonably sure it is sufficient.})
18. Nh4 axb5 19. axb5 Bxf2+ 20. Kxf2 Rxa1 21. Qxa1 Nxc2 22. Qa4 {White had
presumably envisaged this position up to ten moves in advance and liked his
practical chances. White's knights hop around in pleasing ways near the Black
king, while White's kingside construction with the h4-knight and (soon to be)
h2-king is watertight.} Qf6+ (22... Nd4 23. b6+ Kf8 24. bxc7 Qxc7 $11 {was
also interesting, but the d6-pawn is weak.}) 23. Kg1 Nd4 24. b6+ Bd7 25. Qd1
cxb6 26. Kh2 {Reaching a position which is only ever going to be hard for
Black to play.} O-O (26... b5 27. Rf1 Qe7 28. Ne3 {gives White either the
d5-square or g4-pawn}) 27. Rf1 Qg5 $6 {A minor inaccuracy, giving up the wrong
pawn, and White's moves just keep playing themselves.} (27... Qe7 28. Ne3 Qg5
$1 {was the right time to place the queen here. Now} 29. Nhf5 Bxf5 30. Nxf5
Qh5+ 31. Kg1 Nxf5 32. Rxf5 Qg6 $11 {could follow, when White's position is
still easier but his king has lost its bomb shelter.}) 28. Nxd6 $14 Be6 29.
Nhf5 Nxf5 $6 (29... Rd8 30. Nxd4 Rxd6 31. Nxe6 Rxe6 32. Rf5 Qg6 33. Qb3 $14 {
is similar to the last note but with White having better co-ordination. Still,
this was an interesting try, not least because Black can now try and do
'nothing' e.g. ...Re8 and ...Qe6, and try to complete the fortress with ...
Kh7-g6 and ...h5.}) 30. exf5 Bd5 31. Qe2 $1 Qf6 (31... f6 32. d4 {is a
slightly non-obvious point until you reach the position itself, whereupon it
becomes clear that White's rook needs to be on f4, and simultaneously one sees
how to accomplish this.}) 32. Qxg4+ Kh7 33. Ne4 Bxe4 34. dxe4 Rd8 35. Rc1 $16 {
This is now a truly thankless position as the fortress tries will never quite
work and the rook ending is lost. White just plays with ideas for a few moves
until he works out what he wants to do.} Rd4 36. Rc7 Rb4 37. Qe2 Kg7 38. Rc8
Qg5 39. Rc6 Rb3 40. Rc3 Rb4 41. b3 Rd4 42. Rc6 Rb4 43. Qf3 Kh7 44. Rd6 Kg7 45.
Rd5 {Now White's rook is the centralised one!} Qf6 46. Kg1 Kh7 47. Qd3 Kg7 48.
Kf2 Rd4 $2 {Understandable in view of the various rook-trap motifs White has,
but the last try was to wait for Qc3 before doing this, so that the recapture
would come with tempo and then Black might get a good square like e3 or e5 for
his queen.} (48... Qe7 49. Kf3 Qf6 50. Qc3 Rd4 51. Rxd4 exd4 52. Qd3 Qd6 $16 {
is for instance not that much better for White.}) 49. Rxd4 exd4 50. Qb5 Qd8 51.
Qd5 Qf6 52. g4 Kg8 53. Kf3 {Black had no desire to play out the queen ending,
especially since e5 will win a further pawn.} 1-0
