is the modern mainline and I believe it leads to a more interesting game. The
main point of this is that the tempting} b5 $6 {is a weakening move that White
does not mind sacrificing a tempo to induce:} 8. Bf1 Bg4 9. a4 $1 b4 10. d4 $14
) 7... Bg4 8. d3 ({I was expecting the aggressive} 8. d4 {although I think
Black is theoretically fine after} cxd4 9. cxd4 e5 10. d5 Nd4 11. Be3 Nxf3+ 12.
gxf3 Bd7 {with concrete counterplay.}) (8. h3 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 e6 {is another
possible set-up and here, the recently popular} 10. Qg3 $5 {gives Black some
problems to solve.}) 8... e6 9. h3 Bh5 10. Bf4 Be7 11. Nbd2 O-O {We have
reached a strategically complex position where I believe the main question is
when pushing the pawns to d4/d5 is critical for both sides. There are issues
all over the board, with black probably wanting to push some pawns on the
queenside while White will almost always play g2-g4 at some point and consider
launching her f-pawn up the board.} 12. g4 Bg6 13. Bg3 d5 $6 {This was too
hasty and cooperative.} (13... Nd7 $5 {preventing the manoeuvre Nh4 should be
considered. One high level game continued} 14. Nc4 (14. a4 $5) 14... Nb6 $1 15.
Qb3 Nxc4 16. dxc4 f6 $5 {with a balanced by dynamic game in Van der Wiel,J 
(2558)-Tiviakov,S (2567) Wijk aan Zee 2000}) (13... h6 $5 $146 {, followed by .
..d5 should also be considered.}) 14. Nh4 $1 {Snaring the bishop pair which is
especially useful since the position is about to blow wide open.} dxe4 (14...
d4 $5 15. Nxg6 hxg6 16. e5 Nd7 17. Bg2 {might seem like an anti-positional
plan but at least we are keeping the dark square bishop out of play and a move
like} Bh4 $5 {might be difficult to meet.}) 15. Nxg6 hxg6 16. dxe4 b5 17. a4 {
Around this point, I was already feeling quite pessimistic over my position
and decided to play for some tricks. White has no weaknesses and has the
bishop pair for nothing. Also, my queenside is loose.} c4 18. Qc2 (18. b3 b4 $1
{was my main/only idea.}) 18... Bc5 (18... Qb6 $5 19. axb5 axb5 20. b3 cxb3 21.
Nxb3 Nd7 $14) 19. b3 (19. b4 $1 $14) 19... e5 $2 ({I spent a long time
calculating} 19... b4 20. Nxc4 bxc3 21. Rad1 Bd4 {and decided that
self-pinning my bishop wasn't the smartest ideas around. However, it now
surfaces that this was Black's best chance for counter play and after} 22. Bd6

Black has decent chances of creating some sort of a fortress on the kingside.})

26. Nxc5 Qxc5 27. Rb1 Nc6 28. Qb5 Qd6 29. c5 {At this precise moment, with
White managing to get her c-pawn rolling and my clock running down, I was
feeling really depressed and could not for the life of me see how I could ever
get out of this sticky situation. But if you keep finding moves to give your
opponent something to think about, there is always a chance that he/she might
go wrong.} Qd7 30. Qd3 ({I was afraid of} 30. Qa6 $1 {when} Nxe4 31. Bg2 f5 32.
Bxe4 fxe4 33. Qc4+ Qe6 (33... Re6 34. Qxe4) 34. Qxe4 {sees White increasing
her edge.}) 30... Qe7 (30... Qxd3 31. Bxd3 Rd8) 31. Rc1 ({I think White should
be trying to exchange queens with} 31. Qd6 {For example,} Qxd6 32. cxd6 Rd8 33.
Rb6 Nd4 34. Kg2 Nxe4 35. Bxe5 {and now the 2 bishops are really talking.})
31... Rd8 32. Qe3 Rd4 33. f3 Nd7 34. Bf2 $6 {Qianyun made this move instantly.}
({I had seen} 34. Bb5 $1 Ndb8 {and the ugly positions of my knights were going
to be a big problem soon. I was really relieved that she had not gone for this.
}) 34... Nf8 35. Bb5 Qb7 36. Bxc6 Qxc6 37. Qc3 Rd7 38. Qxe5 Ne6 $1 {At the
cost of one pawn, I had managed to get rid of one bishop and I am at least
threatening ..g5 and ..Nf4. Here is the point where there were many viewing
the game on chess24 and commenting that White is completely winning. Of course,
this is a really superficial assessment. With so much counter-play at Black's
disposal, I was already confident of finding some kind of perpetual and was
even trying to see if there are tricks available for me to realistically play
for the win.} 39. Qb8+ Rd8 40. Qb6 Qa4 $1 41. Be3 $2 {Now, Black forces a draw.
} ({According to the computer, the amazing} 41. Qb2 $3 {was White's best
chance to win the game but even here,} Rd3 $1 {would be a scary move to face
over the board:} 42. c6 Rxf3 43. c7 (43. Qc2 $1 {is best but who knows what's
going on here.}) 43... Nxc7 44. Rxc7 Qd1+ 45. Kg2 Rb3 $1 {and who's playing
for the win now?}) 41... Rd1+ 42. Rxd1 Qxd1+ 43. Kf2 Qc2+ 44. Kg3 Qc3 $1 45.
Kf2 (45. c6 g5 $1 46. c7 Kh7 $1 {and Black is fine.}) 45... Qc2+ 46. Kg3 Qc3
