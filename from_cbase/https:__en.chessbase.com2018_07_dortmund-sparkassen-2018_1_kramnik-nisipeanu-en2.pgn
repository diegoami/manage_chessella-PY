Bxf6 Qxf6 9. Qxf6 gxf6 {Despite a miniscule advantage here with a slightly
better structure, Kramnik was still willing to work.} 10. Nf3 Nd7 11. Nh4 Be7
12. Ne2 f5 13. g3 Bxh4 14. gxh4 {but there's not much to work with.} Nf6 15. f3
Ke7 16. Rg1 Nh5 17. Kf2 Rae8 18. b4 f4 {With a pawn sacrifice Black opens his
light-squared bishop.} 19. Nxf4 Nxf4 20. exf4 Kf6 {This looks good - Black
finds a strong square for his king. The black king is not vulnerable and
covers the possible invasion squares of e7 and g7 perfectly. With the king
close to the centre, White must also watch out for possibilities for it to
advance further if he's not careful.} 21. a4 Bf5 22. Ra2 Re7 23. Re2 Rxe2+ 24.
Bxe2 a6 25. Ke3 h6 {Taking the g5 square away from the white rook.} 26. Kd2 Ra8 27. a5 Re8

Kxd3 Re8 35. h4 Rc8 36. Ke3 Re8+ 37. Kf2 Rc8 38. Re1 Ra8 39. Re5 Rb8 {Black
threatens to break with b7-b6. The white rook must return to stand guard and
be ready to counterattack the weakened black pawns in that case.} 40. Re3 Ra8 (
40... b6 $2 41. Rc3) 41. f5 Rc8 (41... Kxf5 $2 42. Re7) 42. Re1 Rd8 43. Kg3 Rc8
44. Kf2 Rd8 45. Kg3 Rc8 46. Kf2 Rd8 {Unfortunately, nothing works. Every way
is blocked.} 1/2-1/2
