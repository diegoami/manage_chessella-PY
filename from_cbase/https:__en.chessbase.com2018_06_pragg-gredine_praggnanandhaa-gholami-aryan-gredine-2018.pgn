1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 $5 {Pragg likes to play 2.g3. But here he decides to mix up
things a bit.} b6 3. g3 Bb7 4. Bg2 g6 5. d4 Bg7 6. O-O O-O {This double
finachetto system employed by Black is quite ambitious and hypermodern. White
can play unambitiously with Nc3, but then Black goes Ne4 and he seems to be
doing fine. Hence, Pragg goes for the more ambitious approach.} 7. d5 $5 {
Blocking the bishop on b7 and now preparing Nc3.} Ne4 8. Nfd2 $5 (8. Qc2 f5 {
is the main line.}) 8... Nc5 {The first new move of the game.} 9. Nb3 a5 10.
Nc3 d6 11. Nd4 Qd7 12. e4 e5 13. Ndb5 {It's a very complex game with a blocked
centre and all the pieces on the board. But somehow I feel that the bishop on
b7 is misplaced.} Nba6 14. a3 f5 (14... a4 15. Nxa4 $16) 15. f3 $5 {A typical
Pragg move. I think this is not in the spirit of the position, but Pragg
believes in it and makes it. Practically it is a good move.} (15. exf5 gxf5 {
seems like the right way to proceed for White. But I am not sure what the best
move is. Perhaps Bf3, with the idea to meet e4 by Be2.} 16. Bf3 $5 e4 17. Be2

Nac5 20. Nxc5 Nxc5 21. b4 $16) 17... c6 $6 18. dxc6 $1 {Pragg is alert to
changes in the position and picks up the pawn.} Bxc6 19. Kg1 $1 {The d6 pawn
is very weak.} (19. Qxd6 Bxb5 20. Nxb5 Qxd6 21. Nxd6 Nb3 $19) 19... Nc7 20. Be3

pawn up and completely winning.} Ba4 28. b5 Bc2 29. Qa8+ Bf8 30. Be3 Qg4 31. h3

A flawless game by Pragg!} 1-0
