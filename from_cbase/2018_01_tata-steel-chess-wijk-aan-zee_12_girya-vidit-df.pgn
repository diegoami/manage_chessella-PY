1. d4 f5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 g6 4. Nd2 {A slightly rare line and maybe one which
indicates a degree of fear. White is trying to get e4 in and swap pieces
quickly. Normal are c4 or Nf3:} (4. Nf3 Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 d6 7. Nc3 {
is the main position of the Leningrad Dutch and now Black chooses between ..c6,
...Nc6 and ...Qe8.}) (4. Nh3 $5 Bg7 5. Nf4 {is a creative path chosen a few
times by Kamsky when forced to play against his own system!}) 4... Bg7 5. e4
fxe4 6. Nxe4 Nxe4 7. Bxe4 d5 (7... O-O 8. Ne2 e5 $5 9. dxe5 Nc6 10. f4 d6 {
is a more adventurous way for Black to play, probably getting dynamic equality}
) 8. Bg2 Nc6 9. Ne2 (9. c3 e5 10. Be3 exd4 11. cxd4 O-O 12. Ne2 Bg4 {was
already really comfortable for Black in Arkell,K -Pruijssers,R chess.com INT
2017}) 9... Bg4 (9... e5 $5 {is a bit sharper, and makes White commit to a
central structure change of some kind, otherwise we just end up with the
previous note.} 10. dxe5 (10. O-O exd4 11. Nf4 O-O 12. Bxd5+ Kh8 $132) 10...
Nxe5 11. Qxd5 Qxd5 12. Bxd5 c6 13. Be4 Bg4 (13... O-O $5 $44) 14. h3 Bf3 $6 {
Now in my personal experience with this line- from the White side- I was able
to slowly neutralise the compensation and go on to win:} 15. Bxf3 Nxf3+ 16. Kf1
O-O 17. Kg2 Rae8 18. Be3 $14 {Fernandez,D-Sanders,I London 2016}) 10. f3 $6 {
Blunting the bishop cannot be clever and now White has no chance of an opening
edge.} (10. c3 $1 e5 (10... O-O 11. h3 {is not really independent, because now
the bishop on g4 needs to think of something to do other than take the knight.}
) 11. h3 Bxe2 12. Qxe2 O-O 13. Qb5 {Reaching a position which has been played
twice from the White side by Croatian grandmaster Nenad Sulava.} exd4 14. Qxd5+
Kh8 15. O-O Qxd5 $1 (15... dxc3 $6 16. bxc3 (16. Qxd8 Raxd8 17. bxc3 Bxc3 18.
Rb1 $14) 16... Qxd5 17. Bxd5 Nb4 18. Bg2 $14 {White even managed to win in 7
further moves here in Sulava,N-Vallejo Pons,F Toscolano 1997}) 16. Bxd5 Rad8
17. Bg2 (17. Bxc6 bxc6 18. cxd4 Bxd4 $11 {Sulava,N-Santo Roman,M Saint
Affrique 1998}) 17... Rf7 $5 {Black doesn't take the pawn yet, and just
improves. It is not clear to me whether White has some way to continue
pressing.}) 10... Bf5 $11 11. O-O Qd6 12. c3 (12. Bf4 Qb4 {was presumably what
White was afraid of, but the machine informs us that the pawn sacrifices are
fully playable for White.} 13. c3 Qxb2 14. g4 Bd7 15. Rb1 Qxa2 16. Rxb7 $132)
12... e5 $6 (12... O-O-O {first was a more stable order.}) 13. Be3 {Not
leading to a disadvantage, but not particularly incisive either.} (13. dxe5
Nxe5 14. Nd4 O-O-O {Else f4 and Re1 motifs come into play.} 15. Nxf5 gxf5 16.
Qc2 $14) 13... O-O-O 14. Qd2 h5 15. Rae1 $6 (15. Bg5 {was worth considering,
but if Black had wished to emulate the play of his countryman, then in
addition to normal moves leading to a slightly more pleasant position (...Bf6,
etc) there was also the violent} h4 $5 $44) 15... h4 16. g4 h3 $1 {Else White
consolidates by playing h3 herself.} 17. Bh1 Bd7 18. Rd1 Rde8 19. dxe5 $2 (19.
Rfe1 {still asks the question of how Black is going to try and break in,
although the obvious choices like} Rhf8 $17 {still leave Black quite obviously
better}) 19... Qxe5 20. Bd4 Nxd4 21. Nxd4 Bxg4 $2 {Maybe marring the victory a
bit.} (21... Qd6 $19 {or similar left White with essentially no moves}) 22.
Rde1 (22. fxg4 Bh6 $19) (22. Rfe1 $1 {was the better rook move, leaving
White's king a flight square.} Qh5 23. Rxe8+ Rxe8 24. fxg4 Qxg4+ 25. Kf2 (25.
Kf1 Rf8+ 26. Nf3 Rxf3+ 27. Bxf3 Qxf3+ 28. Ke1 Bf6 $15 {Black is better, with
his adequate number of pawns for the exchange plus continuing attack, but he
has to win again.}) 25... Bh6 26. Qxh6 Qxd1 27. Qxh3+ Kb8 28. Bf3 {Here White
seems to be surviving with some machine precision, though in a game you would
still take Black.}) 22... Qh5 23. Rxe8+ Rxe8 24. fxg4 Qxg4+ 25. Kf2 Qh4+ 26.
Kg1 ({After} 26. Kf3 Bh6 {also wins trivially}) 26... Bh6 {Not a completely
flawless game by Black (moves 9, 12 and 21) but a very nice finish
nevertheless. Meanwhile, both sides- and most Dutch players for that matter-
should probably pay a bit more attention to this sideline.} 0-1
