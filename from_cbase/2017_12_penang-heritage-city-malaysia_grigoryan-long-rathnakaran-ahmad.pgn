O-O 9. Bd2 a5 10. Rb1 Rb8 11. Qc1 {White's Qc1 is designed to prevent Black's
immediate d6-d5 pawn push as the c5 pawn is weak.} (11. Ne1 Be6 12. Nc2 d5 {
The standard plan for Black's set-up in this position is to break through in
the centre via d6-d5 push. Karpov played this way against Evans back in 1972.}
13. cxd5 Nxd5 14. Nxd5 Bxd5 15. b4 {Despite White's achievement of a queenside
pawn push with b2-b4, Black's successful d6-d5 pawn breakthrough enables the
required simplification and exchanges that will only help Black reach an equal
ending.} Bxg2 16. Kxg2 b5 17. bxa5 Nxa5 18. Ne3 Re8 19. Qc1 Bf8 20. Bxa5 Qxa5
21. Nd5 Re6 22. e4 Qa4 23. f4 Qd4 24. fxe5 Qxe5 25. Rf3 Ra6 {Black's better
pawn structure gives him a slight advantage. But, I am not convinced if it is
sufficient for Black to win in a position with so little material? Evans and
Karpov agreed to a draw in 9 more moves.} 26. Rb3 f5 27. Qb1 Rba8 28. Rxb5 Rxa3

piece-coordination.} axb4 14. axb4 cxb4 15. Bxb4 Nxb4 16. Rxb4) 12. Re1 ({In a
very old game from 1974, White immediately went with 12. Bh6 here.} 12. Bh6 Be6

the c5 pawn in order to prepare for the d6-d5 Pawn push:} 14... b6 15. Ng5 Bg8

Bxb4 Nxb4 17. Rxb4 d5 {Sticking to the standard idea of d6-d5 Pawn break to
trade in the centre and liquidate into an almost equal endgame. This is
Black's best bet here.} 18. cxd5 Nxd5 19. Rb1 Bb7 20. e4 Ne7 21. Qa3 {White
continues to probe Black's position here... with this move, White threatens an
invasion on the d6 square. Black's b6 Pawn remain a key weakness in his
position. White has a slight advantage in this position.} Nc6 $6 {A positional
error, which Grigoryan punishes with his next move. Black should have forced a
temporary closure of the a8-h1 diagonal with the immediate f5-f4 push.} (21...
f4) 22. exf5 $1 {Right idea! White opens up the a8-h1 diagonal before invading
with his knight to d6.} ({The immediate:} 22. Nd6 $6 {is not so good because:}
f4 $1 {Black temporarily closes the a8-h1 diagonal with this move.}) 22... Rxf5
23. Nd6 $1 Ra8 24. Nxb7 Rxa3 25. Nxd8 Nxd8 {Black had banked on this series of
exchanges to further simplify his position. If White now captures the weak b6 pawn and allows Black to capture the stronger d3 Pawn, he would
have lost a big chunk of the advantage and Black is possibly close to getting
a draw. But, Grigoryan had seen further: he protected his d3 pawn and instead
forced Black to keep his weakling, the b6 pawn for another 13 moves. Grigoryan
then brought out his light-squared bishop to join the decisive attack on
Black's weak back rank.} 26. Red1 Ra6 27. Nd2 Bf8 28. Ne4 Rf7 29. Bf1 $1 {This
bishop, which had so far in the game done nothing, joins in the attack with
maximum impact! Such is the dynamic nature of the English and other related
closed opening systems.} Ne6 30. d4 $1 {This d-pawn push in the centre is
the decisive force that will finally bring Black to his knees!} Ra4 31. d5 Nd4
32. Kg2 {White's decision to protect his d-pawn and allow Black to keep his b6
pawn a few moves ago has now been proven to be a wise choice!} Bc5 33. Rdc1 Ra5
34. Bc4 $1 {A second and very effective re-deployment of the light squared
bishop to c4!} Rd7 35. Rc3 Kg7 36. g4 $1 {White is weaving a mating net for
the black king around the square of f6-f8-h8-h6.} h6 37. h4 Be7 $4 {As
Alekhine had once said: the person who made the last mistake loses the game.
This is Black's last and ultimately, the decisive mistake that will allow the
white rooks to breakthrough for a final, winning attack.} 38. Rxb6 $1 Bxh4 39.
d6 $1 {Opening the a2-g8 diagonal and White threatens Rb6-b8 and thereafter
plays Bc4-e6 followed by Rc3-c8 for a possible decisive attack on the black
king. If Black parried this attack, then the white d6 pawn rolls forward!
Notice how strong the white e4 knight is sitting pretty and defending the f2
Pawn against any potential Black counter-attacks!} Bd8 40. Rb8 Nc6 41. Rc8 Na7
42. Be6 $1 Nxc8 43. Rxc8 Raa7 44. Bxd7 Rxd7 45. Nc5 $1 {White wins a piece
after this and with it, the game as well!} Rxd6 46. Rxd8 Rxd8 47. Ne6+ Kf6 48.
Nxd8 Kg5 49. Kg3 h5 50. Ne6+ Kf6 51. Nc5 hxg4 52. Kxg4 1-0

O-O Nd4 9. Qd3 e5 $4 {Black commits a serious positional error here by fixing
his pawn on e5: It will not only become a target for White's attack, but also
having shut the a1-h8 diagonal, he further reduced his scope of counter-play
to almost nil. Black's game slowly, but surely went down hill from here.} ({
Correct would have been:} 9... g6 10. Nc3 Bg7 {to be followed by e7-e6 and
then Ng8-e7-c6 with a solid and playable game.}) 10. Nc3 Ne7 11. Bd1 Nec6 ({
Could Black have tried h7-h5 here with the idea of further restricting White's
