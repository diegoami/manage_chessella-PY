c5 {represents Black's best option here.}) 7. e4 Qc7 ({Probably} 7... Bg4 {
has to be played, but parting with the bishop is a concession, particularly
here where, unlike in the KID, the white c-pawn can give protection to the
d4-pawn.}) 8. e5 $1 {A novelty, but the reason it had not been played before
is because good players never had a crack at this position.} dxe5 9. dxe5 Nd5
10. Qe2 $14 {Sometimes White goes from an early e4-e5 in various variations of
the Pirc, but here with the fianchettoed light-squared bishop he has the perfect version of it.}

contain.} 17. Qf1 $5 {Watch Kramnik's solution to the problem.} (17. Qc2 Bf5
18. Be4 Be6 19. Nxa5 Rxb4 20. Bd2 Rd4 {is a bit confusing.}) ({and the same
goes for} 17. f3 Be6 18. b3 a4 19. f4 axb3 $1 20. Rxa8 Rxc4) 17... Bf5 18. Be3
$1 {There's nothing Vladimir values more in chess than an opportunity to take
away the opponent's counterplay, even at the cost of a small material
concession. We have seen many of his games with exchange sacrifices, and now
Kramnik is happy to part with his queen.} Bd3 19. Bxd4 Bxf1 20. Bxf1 c5 21.
Bxc5 Nd7 22. Bd4 a4 23. b5 Rb8 24. Rec1 h5 $16 25. b6 $6 {Perhaps that pawn
spoke too soon.} ({Further preparation, beginning with} 25. Bg2 {was in order.}

was happy to get rid of that pawn no matter the cost.} 29. Bxb6 Nxb6 30. Nxe7+

33. Rab1 Bxc1 34. Rxc1 a3 35. Nd5 Qd4 36. Ne3 {would be safe for him anyway,
but I'm not sure White would have been able to generate winning chances from
there.}) 33... Qxh3 34. Bf1 Qe6 35. Nxa4 Bxa1 36. Rxa1 h4 37. Nc5 Qd5 38. Rc1
