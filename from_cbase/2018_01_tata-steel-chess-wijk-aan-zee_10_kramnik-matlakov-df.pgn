1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d3 O-O 6. Bg5 {Opting, oddly
enough, for a similar strategy to the one Anand used against Matlakov in the
first round, despite that opening beginning with 3.Bb5. Here it seems like the
immediate idea is probably to prevent Black using a setup with ...d5.} h6 7.
Bh4 Be7 (7... g5 {led to a draw in a recent high-profile game.} 8. Bg3 d6 9. a4

Na5 $5 {is not a completely pointless gambit:} 9. Nxe5 Nxc4 10. Nexc4 (10. dxc4
Nxe4 $15) 10... d5 11. Ne3 dxe4 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Nxe4 Be7 $132 {With two
bishops for two knights and a pawn, Black has very reasonable counterplay,
analogous perhaps to the Gajewski line of the Ruy Lopez.}) 9. Bb3 (9. a4 {
was faced by Kramnik himself from the other side of the board recently.} Nh5
10. Bg3 Nxg3 (10... Nb8 $5 {could have been played immediately, not giving
White the needed clarity on what is happening on the h-file.} 11. Nf1 (11. Nxe5
{is obvious, but following} Nxg3 12. Nxf7 Rxf7 13. hxg3 Qf8 $13 {White will
soon have nothing better than to enter a double-edged material balance of two
pawns plus rook against two bishops, which probably should ultimately favour
the bishops.}) 11... c6 12. Ne3 Nd7 $11 {Playing for ...Ndf6 and ...d5. White
should probably castle short, but the moment he does that, he will no longer
ever use the h-file.}) 11. hxg3 Nb8 12. Nf1 c6 13. Ne3 Na6 14. g4 (14. Bxa6
bxa6 15. d4 $14) 14... Nc7 $11 {Following a slightly complicated opening
battle Black had equalised in Vachier Lagrave,M-Kramnik,V Leuven 2017}) 9...
Nh5 (9... Na5 10. Bc2 c5 $132 {is another standard plan, and Black will
probably continue with ...Be6, ...Nc6 and consider ...d5.}) 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11.
Nc4 Qf6 {Telegraphing a kingside attack rather clearly, but this then prompts
White's overreaction.} (11... Be6 12. Ne3 Nf6 {was solid in Baramidze,
D-Fressinet,L Germany 2009}) 12. Ne3 Nf4 13. Bc2 (13. O-O {followed by g3
could have been one way to go.} Ne7 14. d4 g5 15. g3 $132) 13... Ne7 14. g3 Nh3
15. Qe2 {Now we can see what Kramnik is playing for: a sharp opposite-side
castling position.} c5 16. O-O-O (16. Ng1 $11 {or something was technically
still legal, but who plays chess like this?}) 16... Be6 17. d4 (17. Kb1 $5 {
is almost always useful preparation, and that holds here too.} Rfc8 18. d4 cxd4
19. cxd4 $132) 17... cxd4 18. cxd4 Rac8 {Missing a chance.} (18... Bxa2 $5 {
is possible here according to the machines, and it seems to get an edge! The
critical line is} 19. b3 a5 20. Kb2 $6 a4 21. Kxa2 $2 axb3+ 22. Kxb3 d5 $19)
19. Kb1 Rc7 (19... Rxc2 {was another noteworthy chance, though not obvious if
you're not looking for it. The point is the non-trivial} 20. Kxc2 $6 Qg6 $3 $17
) 20. Rd2 Rfc8 21. dxe5 dxe5 22. Rhd1 {Now everything is under control, and
just like in Anand-Matlakov from round 1, the position is just easier for
White, even if not actually better.} g6 (22... b5 $5 {is a little bit faster.})
23. Rd6 Rc6 24. Bb3 Rf8 $2 (24... Rxd6 25. Rxd6 h5 {survives according to the
machine, but White is definitely significantly better after even the simple}
26. a3 $36) 25. R1d3 $2 ({If I had to guess I would say Black's last move was
based on using the f-file after} 25. Bxe6 {but neither order quite works:} Rxd6
(25... fxe6 26. Rd8 $1 $16) 26. Bxh3 $1 $18 (26. Rxd6 fxe6 $14)) 25... Rfc8 26.
Rd1 Rf8 27. a3 {Missing the same idea again.} h5 {It is generally useful to
avoid Ng4 motifs.} 28. Bxe6 fxe6 29. Rd7 Nc8 $2 (29... Qxf3 30. Qxf3 Rxf3 31.
Rxe7 Rf7 {almost equalises, and so should be preferred.}) 30. Nc4 (30. Nh4 $16
{is another option, cuing up interesting Nd5 ideas.}) 30... Nxf2 31. Ncxe5 {
An alluring and practically tricky option, but not objectively best.} (31. Rf1
$5 Rxc4 32. Rxf2 {leaves Black with bizarrely few options against Qe3-h6. The
only move is} Rd4 $8 {but now if nothing else White acheives a large advantage
with} 33. Nxd4 Qxf2 34. Qxf2 Rxf2 35. Nxe6 Rxh2 36. Rxb7 $16) 31... Nxd1 32.
Qxd1 Rc5 (32... Rb6 33. Qd2 g5 $11 {is the machine defence.}) 33. Qd4 {This is
now practically impossible to defend, but the errors understandably continue
from both sides.} Nb6 (33... Rb5 34. Rc7 {might look like a lethal battery,
but Black can execute the text move now:} Nb6 $14 {and Black has gained a
tempo over the text.}) 34. Rxb7 Rb5 35. Rxa7 Rd8 36. Qc3 (36. Rf7 $3 $16) 36...
Rc8 (36... Nd7 $3 $132) 37. Rc7 {No further accidents.} Rd8 38. Qc6 Rb3 (38...
Rxe5 39. Nxe5 Qxe5 40. Qxb6 Qxe4+ 41. Ka2 Qd5+ 42. Qb3 $16 {is basically over
too.}) 39. Rf7 $1 {Enough to force resignation even if this was a time
scramble.} (39. Rf7 Qxf7 40. Nxf7 Kxf7 41. Ng5+ {wins a rook with the next
check.}) 1-0
