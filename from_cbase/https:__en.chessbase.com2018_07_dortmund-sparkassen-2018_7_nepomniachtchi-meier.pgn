{Of course the question on everyone's lips before the round was whether Nepo
was going to win today and clinch sole first. Let's see if he was up to the
task after surviving a busted position yesterday.} 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3

Dominguez got the better of Georg in this line earlier this year (albeit in
blitz).} (7. Bd3) (7. c3) (7. Bg5) (7. Be3) (7. g3) (7. Bc4 {have all been

cxd4 {is the first move you have to look at} 12. O-O {I think castling short
here is ideal as White avoids any potential attack against the king compared
to long castles in such positions. Now the question is how does Black complete
development?} Be7 $5 13. Rad1 Nd5 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 {and I don't see how White
achieves a serious advantage}) 12. c3 cxd4 13. Nc4 $1 {This is the problem
with inserting Qa5+ here, White has this important move} Qc5 (13... Qd5 $5) 14.

are far from clear though.} 15. Qg4+ Kh8 {White needs to act fast here else
Black will consolidate and have a significant advantage.} 16. cxd4 (16. Qh4 $5

isn't hit with tempo} Qb4+ 18. Ke2 $1 {[%cal Ra1c1,Rc1c3,Rc3g3] and I'd take
White all day}) 16... Qb4+ 17. Kf1 $6 (17. Ke2 {as per the previous line seems
to be more precise, even if it looks a bit scary}) 17... Bc7 {is fine, but also
} (17... Rg8 $5 18. Qh5 Bf8 19. Qxf7 Qe7 20. Qxe7 Bxe7 {and I find it
difficult to believe Black can't hold this}) 18. Qe4 f5 19. Qh4 Kg7 $4 {
unfortunately Georg makes the most natural move which happens to be the losing
move} (19... Kh7 $1 {was correct after which} 20. g4 b5 $1 21. g5 (21. gxf5

switched on. Now Black cannot stop White opening the king up with g5 and
crashing through.} (22. g5 $4 {was Georg's last trick} h5 $1 23. g6 f6 24. Qxh5

the tournament and jumps up to world number 12. No doubt he'll be looking to
consolidate his place in the top 10 in the very near future.} 1-0
