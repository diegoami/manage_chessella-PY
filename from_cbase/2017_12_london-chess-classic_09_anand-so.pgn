{Moving onto the first decisive game, we see the rare phenomenon of a world
champion being essentially outclassed with White in a quiet position.} 1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 O-O 6. a4 {Fashionable at the top.} (6.
c3 {is of course the main move, but now people have started playing not ...d6/.
..a6/other slow moves but immediately} d5 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. a4 {The main move. I
guess people started thinking that if 8.a4 was so good after ...d5, maybe it
could be played before and then we can find something better to do after it
than c3. I shall give two practical examples where this was shown to be equal.}
(8. Nbd2 Nb6 9. Bb5 Bd6 10. Re1 Bg4 11. h3 Bh5 12. Ne4 f5 {Ambition. A certain
type of player would be content with just ...f6 and ...Bf7, which would also
be equal.} 13. Ng3 Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Qd7 15. Bd2 a6 16. Bxc6 Qxc6 17. Qxc6 bxc6 18.
c4 Na4 $11 {Black's activity was beginning to bubble over in Nepomniachtchi,I
-Karjakin,S, Saint Louis 2017}) (8. Re1 Bg4 9. h3 Bh5 {is a major battleground
but I don't believe White has anything}) 8... Nb6 (8... a6 {Going to something
of an extreme of trashing the queenside structure in return for one tempo and
some activity.} 9. a5 b5 10. axb6 Nxb6 11. Bb3 Bg4 12. Qe2 Kh8 13. Be3 Bd6 14.

Qc7 15. Qh5 Bd6 16. Nd2 {White may now be slightly more comfortable, but there
are means and ways of playing against the bishop pair even without structural
compensation, as evidenced by the fact that the Nimzo is not refuted as soon
as White gets in cxd5...} Nd5 {Inspired by the Marshall Gambit.} 17. Ne4 Be6

watching the game. White is not finished, but morally this was already the
beginning of the end in Anton Guijarro,D-Howell,D, Minsk 2017}) 6... h6 {
Not playing ...d5 now, because White can make do without c3 and hence get a
good version of the above.} (6... d5 7. exd5 Nxd5 8. Re1 Bg4 (8... Re8 {
defends the pawn in logical-looking fashion but this can be met well by a
now-improved} 9. c3 ({or even} 9. d4 $5)) 9. Nbd2 $14 {The fact of White's Bc4
no longer being tactically vulnerable may just be enough to give White an
advantage here.}) 7. c3 a5 8. Nbd2 d6 9. h3 Be6 (9... Ne7 {is more immediately
ambitious}) 10. Re1 Bxc4 11. Nxc4 (11. dxc4 $15 {is not stupid, but long
before White arranges Nd5 Black will have played ...f5.}) 11... Re8 12. Be3 $11
{I can't shake the feeling that Be3 admits White has nothing whatsoever.} (12.
Ne3 Bxe3 13. Bxe3 d5 14. Qc2 {tries to play with some imbalance}) 12... Bxe3

admits that White has nothing. Black can now choose between a vast variety of
plans. There is ...Nh7-g5, which is more often played as a White plan. He can
play for ...b5 or ...d5 or ...f5; develop with ...Rad8/...Kh8/...Nh5, or
various combinations of the above.} d5 {Not wrong, but demanding that Black do
some calculation of d4.} 18. exd5 (18. d4 $5 exd4 (18... dxc4 19. dxe5 Qe6 20.

and tactical vulnerabilities appear.} 24. Qd3 $6 {White's pieces begin to get
a little tied up.} (24. g3 {followed by say Ne3 and Nf3 would have left
White's pieces in less tactically unfortunate positions}) 24... Qe7 (24... Qd5

had to be played, but the knight ending is unenviable after} Qe2 28. g3 (28.

actually White could maybe get an ending with Qc2 but he'd now be down two
pawns rather than one. So he resigned.} 0-1
