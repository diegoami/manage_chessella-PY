1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Ng1 {The Anti-Rogoff system pioneered by the German
grandmaster but never used again after this milestone game.} Bg7 4. Qa4 O-O 5.
Qxd7 $5 {An incredibly deep sacrifice, the point of which only becomes clear
half a dozen moves later.} Qxd7 6. g4 Qxd2+ $1 {Rogoff sees the danger hidden
in Hübner's ultra-sharp play (we don't). He knows he has to return the
material.} 7. Kxd2 {7...Bxd2 was better:} (7. Bxd2 Nxg4 8. Nc3 Nc6 9. h3 Nge5
10. b3 Rd8 11. O-O-O {and White, while still at a disadvantage, has a better
game than after the text move.}) 7... Nxg4 8. b4 {Hübner overlooks the double
threat (...Bxa1 as well as ...Nxf2) to his rooks.} a5 {Strategically sound.
There is no reason to execute one of the threats immediately, since they will
not go away.} 9. a4 {Trying to prepare an escape route for the rook.} Bxa1 10.
Bb2 Nc6 11. Bh8 Bg7 {Trapping the bishop. This unique idea deserves acclaim.}
12. h4 axb4 {and White, one of the world's leading grandmasters at the time,
offered a draw, which the respectful economist Rogoff was glad to accept.}
1/2-1/2
