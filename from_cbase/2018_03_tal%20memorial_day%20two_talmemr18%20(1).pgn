{The King's Indian Attack has been a fierce weapon in the hands of many white
players including the great Bobby Fischer. When Svidler decided to play it
against Kramnik I was excited, mainly because Kramnik would show us some ideas
from the black side which will help people defend against the dangerous KIA
lovers.} 1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 e6 4. O-O Be7 5. d3 O-O {Kramnik makes the
