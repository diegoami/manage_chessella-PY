{Yilmaz Mustafa had an excellent tournament and his final shared 2nd place
speaks for itself. What drew my attention was a moment from his R3 game, when
White played:} 33. e5 $1 {Taking such a straightforward decision requires
precise calculation since after} Nxe5 {White is stepping on a mine field. But
so does Black.} 34. Rd1 {the only move} (34. fxe5 {is a bad idea} Rc2 $19 {
[%cal Gc1h6]}) 34... Qc4 35. Qe1 {again, the only move} (35. Qe3 {runs into}
Qa4 $15 {[%cal Ge5c4] and the knight is safe.}) (35. Qd2 {allows Black to
safely retreat the knight} Nf7 {and the d6-resource is not longer available,
due to the hanging bishop on e6.}) 35... Nf3 {The most natural continuation
but it proved to be the wrong direction - the knight was taken as a hostage.} (
35... Nd3 {doesn't change much} 36. Qe3 Nb4 37. d6 $18) ({But} 35... Qxa2 $1 {
is an incredibly strong resource, after which I am not even sure who is
fighting for a win.} 36. fxe5 Rc2 37. Qg1 h5 {[%csl Rh3][%cal Gg6g5] With
correct play however, the game should end peacefully. As always.}) 36. Qe3 Qc3
37. Rd3 Ng1+ 38. Kg2 Qb2+ ({If} 38... Qc1 39. Qxc1 Rxc1 40. Rd2 {and the
knight is still trapped.}) 39. Rd2 Qc1 40. Bg4 Kf8 41. Bd1 {Beautiful cage.}
Rc5 42. Qf2 Qc4 43. Rd4 1-0

{It is not the first nor the last time this will happen: taking a terrible
decision during the massive time trouble of your opponent.} 36. Rh4 {planning
Qh3} g5 {and now} 37. Rg4 {came without thought. Instead, it was not too late
to settle for Rhd4 or Rc4 or Ne4, where Black has the practical problem of the
30 seconds on the clock.} Nc3 $1 ({Erwin calculated only} 37... Nf4 38. Qf3 {
with h4 idea in mind, where White is indeed pressing.}) 38. Qd3 {what else?} (
38. Re1 {is losing on the spot} Ne2+ 39. Rxe2 Qa1+ {that was not very much
appreciated by Erwin's wife either.}) 38... Nxd1 39. Qxd1 a5 40. h3 axb4 41.
Rxb4 Qc3 42. Qh5 Qxa3 43. Rc4 Qa1+ 44. Kh2 Qe5+ 45. g3 Qd5 {After the 37. Rg4
blunder there was nothing White could have done. But the off-moment Erwin
suffered as early as R2 didn't spoil his mood, except the first half hour,
which is incredibly little if you think about it. AD's influence is contagious:
) The Dutch GM still minimized the damages and finished on the 5th place.} 0-1

had his share of difficulties, particularly against Iceland's former Candidate.
