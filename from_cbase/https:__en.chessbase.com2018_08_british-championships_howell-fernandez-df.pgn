1. Nf3 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. c4 c5 $5 {Played quickly, and the idea was probably to
transpose to a Panov after 4.d4 cxd4 5.exd4 Nc6 6.Nc3.} 4. a3 {Played after a
great many minutes thought. I remember it amused me during the game that at
many points I was actually behind David on the clock, and I then wondered how
common this could possibly be. The following round, Luke McShane went even
further behind David on the clock, proving my suspicions unfounded.} (4. Qa4+
$146 {was the rather original idea I was thinking about.} Bd7 (4... Nbd7 5. Nc3
e6 6. cxd5 exd5 7. d4 {vindicates White's play, though it is not clear whether
he will actually stand better in the IQP position.}) (4... Qd7 5. Qxd7+ {
and now there are many lines, but White's ideas of Nc3-b5 and Ne5/g5 seem to
guarantee an edge and/or the bishop pair in all cases, e.g.} Bxd7 6. Nc3 dxc4
7. Ne5 Nc6 8. Nxd7 Kxd7 9. Bxc4 $14) 5. Qb3 {Now Black too has to play with
some imagination to stay in the game. Unfortunately for me, I saw rather a lot
of ways in which my opponent could do this, e.g.} d4 $5 (5... Bc6 6. Ne5 a6 7.
Nxc6 Nxc6 8. cxd5 Na5 9. Qc2 Nxd5 10. Nc3 $132) (5... e6 6. Qxb7 $44) 6. exd4
cxd4 7. Nxd4 e5 $44) 4... Nc6 5. cxd5 (5. b4 $5 {This was my second original
idea in the game.} d4 $5 (5... e6 $5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. bxc5 d4 $5 {This
incredibly maximalist try was the main reason I rejected 5.b4! However, the
engine thinks I can just take this and probably stand better.}) (5... cxb4 6.
axb4 Nxb4 7. Qa4+ Nc6 8. Nc3 {should give White enough play, and in any case I
rarely mind being material down for approximately adequate compensation.}) 6.
b5 Na5 7. d3 (7. exd4 cxd4 8. Bb2 Bg4 $1 $15 {is surprisingly annoying.}) 7...
dxe3 8. Bxe3 b6 $1 $11 {Black has acheived solid equality, and as so often in
such cases, his position seems easier to play.}) 5... Nxd5 6. d4 {The 'backup'
idea that I had in mind when playing my 4th move.} e6 (6... cxd4 7. Nxd4 Nf6 8.
Nxc6 Qxd1+ 9. Kxd1 bxc6 10. Nd2 $11 {is a position David would love as White,
so it is unsurprising he didn't choose the Black side.}) 7. Be2 (7. dxc5 Bxc5
8. Bd3 $11 {is by no means stupid, but it is clear to me that in this position,
the better player will emerge with a better position after about 4-5 further
moves.}) (7. Nc3 {deserves attention, but I didn't like the structure after}
cxd4 8. exd4 g6 {as I thought a3 to be quite a useless addition.}) 7... cxd4 8.
Nxd4 Bd7 (8... Nf4 $5 {occupied my attention for a while, trying to force me
to take an IQP anyway.} 9. Nxc6 $1 Qxd1+ 10. Bxd1 Nd3+ 11. Kd2 Nxf2 12. Rf1
Ne4+ 13. Kc2 bxc6 14. Bf3 f5 15. Nc3 Ba6 16. Rd1 $11 {The position is level,
but White will have ever so slightly more structural integrity at the end.}) 9.
e4 Nxd4 10. Qxd4 Rc8 $2 {A fairly significant error after half an hour of
thought. Possibly, my opponent was convinced that on psychological grounds I
would have to trade the queens, and simply wanted to do so in the best way he
could.} (10... Qc7 $1 {The best way to pose questions about the legitimacy of
White's quality-over-quantity approach to development.} 11. O-O Nf4 12. Bf3 (
12. Bxf4 Qxf4 13. Nd2 Bc6 $11) 12... e5 13. Bxf4 $1 Bd6 $3 {Black has a more
pleasant position, even if it is still basically equal.}) (10... Qb6 11. Qd3 (
11. Qxb6 Nxb6 12. Be3 Rc8 13. Nd2 $11) 11... Qc7 12. O-O Nf4 $11 {is also
sensible, if a bit counter-intuitive.}) 11. O-O Qb6 12. Qxb6 $2 {Returning the
favour after half a minute of thought...} (12. Qd3 $1 {It is not clear to me
why I didn't choose this move, which is easily the most natural, and which
might even give White an edge.} Nf6 (12... Ne7 13. Nc3 Ng6 14. Rd1 Bc6 15. b4
$1 $14 {has the potential to go even worse for Black}) 13. Nc3 {Now White gets
all kinds of useful developing moves for free, like Qg3, Be3 and e5.} Bc5 14.
e5 $1 Nd5 15. Qg3 $14) 12... Nxb6 13. Nc3 (13. b3 $11 {was my first thought,
but I somehow couldn't countenance leaving development for even one more move,
the bishop-pair notwithstanding.}) 13... Nc4 14. Rd1 f6 15. Bxc4 {Not bad as
such, but in practical terms this severely limits my winning potential. Now
Black can relax and play for a win on his own time, which he proceeds to do.}
Rxc4 16. Be3 a6 {There was also ...b6.} 17. Rd3 Rc8 $1 {Correctly noticing
that he has to defend d8 with the rook and not just the bishop.} (17... Be7 18.
Rad1 Bc8 19. b4 Kf7 20. Na4 $1 $132) 18. Rad1 Bc6 19. f3 Be7 20. g4 Kf7 21. Kg2

32. Ke2 Bc6 33. Bb6 Bh2 34. Rd8 $2 {Very close to losing by force.} (34. Ke3
$11 {was almost certainly best, trying to play either Ne2 or f4.}) 34... Rxd8
35. Bxd8 Bf4 $1 {Now White goes on tilt, despite his position not yet being
indefensible.} 36. Kd3 (36. b3 g6 37. hxg6+ Kxg6 38. a4 $15 {is a little
unpleasant, but White is not a million miles away from setting up some kind of
Nd3, Be3 fortress.}) 36... f5 37. Bb6 $2 {In perfect chess, maybe the losing
mistake.} Bc1 38. Kc2 Bg5 39. Kd3 Bc1 40. Kc2 Bg5 41. Kd3 h6 $6 (41... fxg4 42.
fxg4 e5 $17) 42. Bd4 $2 (42. Be3 Bxe3 43. Kxe3 fxg4 44. fxg4 Kf6 $15 {was
something I assessed as lost, but in reality it may not be.}) 42... fxg4 43.
fxg4 Bc1 {Now Howell doesn't miss his chance. There isn't any way to keep the
pawn.} 44. Nd1 Bb5+ 45. Kc2 Bf4 46. Nf2 e5 $1 (46... Be2 47. e5 {could still
be a bit interesting.}) 47. Bc5 Be2 48. b4 b5 49. Kc3 Kf6 50. Bd6 $2 (50. Kc2
Bg3 51. Kd2 Bxf2 52. Bxf2 Bxg4 53. Bb6 Bxh5 54. Ke3 Ke6 {I assessed this
position type as lost, though maybe it still forces Black to find an idea or
two. The general idea is that Black plays ...g5-g4, then ...Bf3-h1 to tie the
White king to e3, then ...Kh5, and finally ...g3. Matters become a little bit
complicated if White takes on e5, but not too much. For instance:} 55. Kf2 Bd1

also wins.} 53. Kxd3 Kg5 54. Bc5 Ba1 55. Bf8 Kxg4 56. Bxg7 Kxh5 57. Ke3 Bb2 58.
