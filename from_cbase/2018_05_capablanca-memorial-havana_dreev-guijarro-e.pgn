1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. c4 e6 4. Bg5 h6 5. Bxf6 Qxf6 6. Nbd2 Qd8 7. g3 g6 {
A new move. However, in this game the idea to put the bishop to g7 backfired.
Black's black-squared bishop never managed to enter the game and remained
passive throughout.} 8. Bg2 Bg7 9. O-O O-O 10. Qc2 Nd7 11. Rac1 c6 12. e4 Qb6
13. Rfd1 Rd8 14. e5 a5 {The engines see only a slight advantage for White but
the position is difficult to play for Black - it is cramped and almost all of
his pieces are passive.} 15. h4 Nf8 16. Nf1 Bd7 17. Ne3 Be8 18. a3 Rac8 19. Qd2
h5 20. Bh3 Bh6 21. Ng5 Ra8 22. Rc3 Nh7 23. f4 dxc4 $6 {This invites the white
knight to come to d6.} ({Maybe it was better to continue suffering stoically,
e.g. with} 23... Nxg5 24. fxg5 Bf8 {and Black remains passive but White still
has to find a way to make progress.}) 24. Nxc4 Qa7 25. Ne4 c5 26. Ncd6 cxd4 27.
Rc7 d3+ 28. Qf2 $1 {After the exchange of queens Black's position quickly
collapses.} Qxf2+ 29. Kxf2 Ra6 30. Nxe8 Rxe8 31. Nd6 Rb8 32. Nxf7 Bf8 33. Rxd3
Rb6 34. Nd8 $1 {Black resigned. He can take on b2 with check but after 34...
Rxb2+ 35.Kf3 he cannot defend against the many threats by White.} 1-0
