systems but, as his opponent employed the Grunfeld before against our friend

his idea. It is not a critical line at all but White makes Black think twice

to play e4 at some point, we can assume that this is a Benoni with a free

after seeing some games, particularly Dreev's, I realized it is not so clear
how can black use this tempo to conduct its typical plans.} 9. Nd2 Na6 {

{This game was highly decisive for the final standings. Our good friend GM
Felipe El Debs was a draw away from winning the IV Arica International Open!

was feeling that his position was really nice after this move. In fact, Black
is giving up a lot of light squares, but the pieces are well developed and
White is unable to play d4 so easy. It looks like Black has landed in pleasant
situation.} 16. exf5 Rxf5 {Demchenko thought for a long time here and came
with a surprising decision.} 17. Bg3 $5 (17. g3 {should be the best, but looks
strange for the burried Bh2} Bg5 18. Qe2 Rf7 19. Bg2 Nc7 20. Nd2 Bxd2 $1 21.
Qxd2 Qd7 {[%csl Yh2]}) 17... Bxg3 18. fxg3 {It is rather difficult, in chess,
to find your way on the board when you are not able to understand your
opponent's moves. Regarding this game, not only El Debs but also we (Brazilian
masters playing in Arica) were very impressed by Demchenko's decision. El Debs
told us he barely considered Bg3 as an option, and so did we. This move looks
quite peculiar since White is spoiling its own pawn structure. In hindsight,
it is easy to change our minds about this but the Russian GM correctly
evaluated the consequences in the right moment. Despite the doubled pawns on
the kingside, White is ok and can continue playing for centralization, a well
timed d4-break and the subsequent invasion on the light-squares. Truly deep!}

position here} 20. Ne4 Qe7 21. Rad1 Rad8 $11) 19. Nd2 Nc7 $6 {Careless and

{Open tournaments are the type of events which sometimes feature big surprises. The Chilean IM Salinas, who almost scored his third GM norm, caused
perplexity right in the third day, by defeating two strong GMs in a row: Adly
and Mareco. In this game, he embarks on a theoretical discussion and shows
nice preparation and sharp tactical vision against the highly experienced and
strong Egyptian GM Adly.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 {
