Bg6 16. Nbd2 Nh5 17. Nf1 Bc5 18. g3 {[#] This position with the symmetrical
structure looks manageable at first glance, but the
character position plays a big role. Small mistakes can have a big impact.} Kh7 {And this move was probably such an inaccuracy.} 19. Kg2 Qe7 20. Bc2 $1 {An important,
versatile move. The white king is in the line of fire of the bishop, which
will play a role later, as will the white pawns on the
queenside.} Rfd8 21. b4 Bb6

$1 31. Qxf2 $1 {It's essential for White to prevent the black queen from reaching h4.} e4 {Aronian misses his chance and is now lost.} ({Instead, the surprising} 31... Nxb4 $3 {would have turned the tables. Black had to realize the follow up
with all heavy pieces quickly attacking the naked white king - at all costs!} 32.
