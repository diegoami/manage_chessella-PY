getting surprised again and again in the next few moves. Chess is still
developing.} 4. c3 (4. d3 {has the advantage of making Black's (critical)

for White compared to d3 after c3, as c2-c3 might not be the most wanted move
here.}) 4... Nf6 5. d4 ({When I last looked at these lines Black was doing
fine after} 5. d3 O-O 6. O-O d5 7. exd5 Nxd5 {but then} 8. a4 $5 {was
discovered. The point of this move is a bit obscure, but in a surprising
amount of lines the a-pawn becomes a source of annoyance for Black.} (8. Re1

(whereas White has won a few rapid games).}) 8... Bg4 (8... Bf5 9. Re1 Nb6 10.

Mamedyarov,S (2800)-Kramnik,V (2785) 80th Tata Steel GpA 2018. The ball seems
to be in White's court here.}) 9. a5 a6 10. Nbd2 {and with Black's queenside
being frozen stiff, White can concentrate on the h3/Nd2-e4-g3-maneouvre.
Compared to the lines where White plays Re1 instead of a4, White is doing
significantly better.}) 5... exd4 {I was under the (mistaken and obviously
simplified) impression that this didn't set Black any problems.} 6. e5 $1 {
This is the only ambitious move.} (6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 d5 9.

forces a draw.}) 6... d5 $1 {More than a hundred games with this position in
the few last years rubbing my face in my obvious ignorance.} 7. Bb5 ({From a
rather superficial perspective (like mine)} 7. Be2 $5 {is far, far more
uncommon, but seems to contain some poison.} d3 $5 {is principled} (7... Ne4 8.

in the drivers seat, in Jobava,B (2702)-Karjakin,S (2786) Loo 2013, since
Black's bishop on b4 doesn't get access to the active b6-square.}) 9. O-O O-O

Bg4 seem like the most critical candidates.} (10... Ne7 {also makes sense and
White's best chance to keep some pressure is} 11. Bd3 Bf5 12. O-O {when it is
a small victory for White to have stopped Bg4 without spending a tempo on h3.})

move is} 18... Qc8 {, when it first looks like} 19. f5 {is a blunder due to}

the exchange also merits attention. Perhaps Anand avoided this because he 
(rightly) evaluated it as dangerous for him?!!}) 19. Rd3 $1 {The point of this
move is to threaten f4-f5, when Nxe5 can be met with dxe5, without dropping
off the bishop on e3.} Qxg4 20. hxg4 f5 $1 (20... f6 21. f5 Nxe5 22. dxe5 Bxe3+

some real pressure here.} (22. Ne2 $1 {leaves Black with a cramped position.

wonderful e6-square. White's extra pawn counts for nothing.} 23. Rxh8 Rxh8 24.
