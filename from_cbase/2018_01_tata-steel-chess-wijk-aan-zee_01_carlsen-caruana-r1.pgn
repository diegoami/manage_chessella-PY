1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Qe2 {A minor choice, generally
renowned for leading to a drawish ending.} Qe7 6. d3 Nf6 7. Nc3 Qxe2+ 8. Bxe2
g6 ({On schematic grounds, I might have preferred} 8... c6 {to close off all
options of Nb5 and 'dominate' the c3-knight. The followup could then be ...d5
and ...Bg4, with the idea of trying to exchange the light-squared bishop for
anything, and exchange the pair of dark-squared bishops.}) 9. Nd4 a6 10. Bf4 {
Now this pressures the d6-pawn, so as to prevent ...c6 following a fianchetto.
Black has little choice but to play ...Nc6 one way or another, and he will be
left with doubled pawns.} Bg7 (10... Nbd7 {is the maximalist move, trying to
prevent Bf3 altogether.}) 11. h3 Bd7 12. Bf3 Nc6 13. Nxc6 Bxc6 14. Bxc6+ bxc6
15. O-O-O Kd7 {Objectively, there is nothing whatsoever wrong with Black's
position, and as long as one doesn't get carried away with premonitions of
White kings appearing on a5 after the rooks come off (echoes of Rubinstein)
then it is also easy enough to play.} 16. Rhe1 Rhe8 17. Ne4 (17. Bd2 {may have
been wisest, focusing on the task of exchanging all the rooks as quickly as
possible and then placing pawns on light squares.}) 17... Nd5 (17... Nxe4 18.
dxe4 Re6 19. f3 Rae8 20. Bd2 {is also fine but now White's moves are
definitely easier to find, starting with c4, Kc2, b3.}) 18. Bd2 f5 19. Ng5 h6
20. Nf3 g5 21. c3 c5 22. Kc2 Bf6 ({The computer wants} 22... a5 {but it can
never be good to allow this pawn to be fixed.}) 23. Rxe8 Rxe8 24. Re1 Rf8 25.
Rh1 Re8 26. g3 g4 27. Ng1 Bg5 28. Kd1 a5 29. Ne2 {One of several acceptable
moves.} (29. a4 Rb8 $1 $15 {was the point and White is being stretched a bit
thin.}) 29... a4 (29... Rb8 $5 30. b3 a4 31. Bxg5 hxg5 {is a little bit
testing, perhaps}) 30. Bxg5 hxg5 31. hxg4 fxg4 32. Rh5 Re5 33. Rh7+ Ke6 34. a3
(34. d4 {screams out to be played, but there is nothing much going on here
either:} Rf5 35. c4 Nb6 36. b3 axb3 37. axb3 Rf3 $11 {Nevertheless, this was
marginally safer for White than the game.}) 34... Rf5 35. c4 Nf6 36. Rh2 {
It looks slightly dangerous to a human to allow ...Rxf2, because ...Nd7-e5
with pressure will follow soon.} Rf3 37. Kc2 Nd7 38. d4 {Else White is in very
obvious difficulties.} Nb6 (38... Rf5 {is a sensible engine suggestion; this
keeps a bit of pressure by not clarifying the situation of the d4-pawn.} 39.
Kd3 (39. Rh7 Nb6 40. dxc5 Rxc5 $36) 39... Rf7 {An engine move; what was your
first clue?} 40. Rh6+ $6 Ke7 41. Rh2 cxd4 42. Nxd4 Ne5+ 43. Kc3 c5 $15) 39.
dxc5 dxc5 40. Nc3 Ke5 41. Nd1 ({Presumably the expected continuation was:} 41.
Nd1 Nxc4 42. Rh5 Kd4 43. Rxg5 Ne5 44. Rg7 {when White is completely out of the
woods.}) 1/2-1/2
