1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 Nxd5 $5 {Clearly Hou Yifan was not in the
mood to face a minority attack today. Although this move has been played by a
lot of good players, it is unquestionably a secondary one. According to the
current state of top level praxis the line is playable, but very few people do
it correctly, especially from the Black side!} 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 c5 7. Rb1 Be7
8. Nf3 O-O 9. Bc4 Nc6 (9... Qc7 {leads us to a veritable minefield of top
games:} 10. Qe2 a6 11. O-O (11. a4 cxd4 12. cxd4 Bd7 $11 {might objectively
equalise, but that didn't stop Black being annihlated in a 'modern attacking
classic', Matlakov,M-Aronian,L Tbilisi 2017}) 11... b5 12. Bd3 Nd7 $1 (12...
Bb7 $6 13. a4 $1 bxa4 $2 14. Bf4 {left Black virtually lost already in Carlsen,
M-So,W chess.com INT 2017}) 13. a4 (13. h4 e5 14. h5 h6 $11 {Navara,D
-Dominguez Perez,L Saint Louis 2017}) 13... bxa4 14. g3 $13 {The position is
easier to play for White, but obviously far from clear.}) 10. O-O b6 11. Be3 (
11. d5 Na5 12. Bd3 c4 13. Bc2 exd5 14. exd5 Bb7 $11 {probably equalised for
Black in her previous outing with the line: Svidler,P-Hou,Y Geneve 2017}) 11...
Bb7 12. Qe2 cxd4 (12... Qc7 $5 13. d5 (13. Ba6 {is White's most obvious idea,
but there is a concrete remedy:} cxd4 14. cxd4 Nb4 $1 15. Bxb7 Qxb7 $132 {
and White's centre continues to come under fire.}) 13... Na5 14. dxe6 Nxc4 15.

(17... Rfd8 18. Rbc1 Qb8 {is apparently still nail-biting equality}) 18. Qxf3
$14 {Certainly by contrast to Navara-Dominguez above the bishop on b5 poses
Black some extra problems, connected with Rbc1 and Bc6.} Bc5 19. Rbc1 Qe7 20.
Bf4 Bd6 21. Bc6 {That's just it. Now Black has to go into a bit of a huddle,
and Anand's technique has been his strong point in this event.} Bxf4 (21... Ba8
{still kept White's advantage to a minimum by making him work for every extra
pawn advance}) 22. Qxf4 Bxc6 23. dxc6 Qc7 24. Rd6 $18 {The forcing
continuations get nowhere, so White just improves. The obvious follow-up is to
play the queen to d5 and try for Rd7.} Rcd8 25. Rcd1 h6 26. g3 Rxd6 ({It is
interesting to note the tactical point White basically has to use if Black
sits tight.} 26... Rc8 27. Qc4 Kh8 28. Qd5 Kg8 29. a4 Kh8 30. Kg2 (30. Rc1 $2

Rd7 {Another neat tactical point, but if not this, then something else would
have worked.} Qa5 32. c7 Rf8 33. Qe7 {Mate cannot be far away.} 1-0
