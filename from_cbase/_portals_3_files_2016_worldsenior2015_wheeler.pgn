{Jamaica's sole representative in the 65+ Open World Championship played the
Sicilian Defence for the first time in the event, saved his best for last and
won an explosive, "sacrificial" encounter in the style of Mikhail Tal!} 1. e4
c5 {Yes!! After all we were in Italy! I had been encouraging "Bob" from early
in the tournament to play the Sicilian defence (and wage war!) as I was
confident he could dominate lower rated opponents. He had, however, stuck
dogmatically to the French defence.} 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3 Qc7

15. g4 $2 {This was a big mistake. White should play either the usual 15. Kh1
or 15.f5. The text-move invites Black to go on the warpath for which White is
unprepared as his pieces are not ideally placed.} d5 $1 {As Wheeler said in
our post-mortem it is an age-old adage that a flank/wing attack should be met
by a powerful counter-thrust in the centre! Amazingly, after Black's 15th move
the position already looks to be winning for the second player.} 16. e5 Bc5+ $1

It is fitting that Black's monarch prompts resignation from his opposing liege.
A powerful performance from Bob Wheeler, the six-time Jamaican champion and
the first Jamaica (2015) Seniors Champion.} 0-1
