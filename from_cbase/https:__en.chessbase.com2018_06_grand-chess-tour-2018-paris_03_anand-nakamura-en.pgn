Ng8 22. f3 Ngf6 23. Nd1 a5 24. Nf2 Nc5 25. Bb5 Qb6 {[#] Anand had some advantages but nothing came of it. Once again, the ex-World Champion doesn't shy away from sacrificing an exchange to bring new momentum to the action.} 26. Rxc5 dxc5 27. a4 c4 $1 {This pawn sacrifice frees the black heavy pieces.}
28. Qc3 Qd6 29. Qxc4 Rac8 {It was hard to avoid that if Nakamura did not want to stand idly by and watch Anand take advantage of his better position.} 30. Qxc8 Rxc8 31. Rxc8+ Kg7 32. Nd3 {[#] Nearly equal in material terms, but Anand continues to have extremely active pieces, so the position should be roughly balanced.} Nh5 33. Kf1
Qb6 34. Nc5 {The black pieces cannot enter the white position at first.} Kh6 35. Ke1 {There was probably no need for the king to journey to the other side of the board. It could also stay on g1 or h2 or perhaps with an early draw. Any black attempt to penetrate with the queen to h4 would be out of the question on account of the d5-pawn.} Ng3

Qd1 43. Kb3 g5 44. Nd3 {[#] White stands well, but in contrast to the variations with the king remaining on the kingside, Black's king and queen have already entered the white position, making life difficult.} 45. Kc3 ({Here} 45. d6 $1 {was am excellent way to proceed. Black cannot prevent the pawn from advancing to d7 and would have a huge problem defending himself. The value of a defended pawn on the seventh rank is more like 3.0 rather than 1.0!) 45... Nb6 46. Nxe5 {This is no good.} ({Again on tap was}
