1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Notwithstanding the
increased playability of lots of openings these days, at the top the old rule
'Petroff/Berlin/Caro for a draw, Najdorf/Marshall for a win' is holding up
reasonably well.} 6. g3 {I have to confess that as a Najdorf player I have
never seen the appeal of this move. If White wants kingside expansion, surely
6.h3 is a better way to start? Nevertheless, it is fairly popular.} ({A
related line which I have tried is:} 6. a4 e5 7. Nde2 $5 Nc6 (7... Be7 8. g3

possibility of ...b5.} 11. Qd2 Rc8 12. O-O O-O 13. a5 h6 $6 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15.
Ra4 Nc6 16. Nd5 $14 {Fernandez,D-Hamitevici,V England 2015}) 6... e5 (6... g6
7. Bg2 Bg7 8. O-O O-O {is another common approach for Black, reasoning that
g3-systems are by no means the most critical for White against the Dragon, and
that ...a6 is useful in almost any kind of Sicilian position. This has seen
some high-level tests too, e.g.} 9. b3 Bd7 10. Bb2 Nc6 $6 (10... e6 $5 $11 {
works tactically, and so on principle it should be played}) 11. Nd5 Re8 12. c4

Re1 Nbd7 $1 {It is important to place the knight here, even though it might
seem like the d5-square is in no particular danger.} (10... Nc6 11. Nd5 Rc8 12.
c4 $14 {is surprisingly annoying.}) 11. Nd2 {Clearly, this knight is going to
d5, but the problem is that Black can, without too much trouble, arrange for
White's final recapture on d5 to be with a pawn, and then Black will get a
good version of the standard Sveshnikov structure.} (11. a4 $11 {makes a fair
amount of sense}) 11... b5 12. Nf1 Bg4 $5 {This move may not be the best, and
Carlsen might well have known that during the game, but sometimes it is good
to make the position 'strategically richer' against a weaker opponent.} ({
It is interesting, perhaps, to consider why Carlsen did not continue with the
supremely consistent} 12... b4 $5 {The followup could be} 13. Nd5 Nxd5 14. exd5
Bf5 15. a3 a5 $132 {and while White lacks a convincing way to immediately
exploit the excessive airiness of Black's queenside, Black also lacks a way to
push ...f5-f4, and hence also winning chances.}) (12... Nb6 {was possible
immediately:} 13. Ne3 b4 14. Ncd5 Nfxd5 15. Nxd5 Nxd5 16. exd5 Bd7 $11) 13. f3

b4 16. Ncd5 {leads to a better version of all the above lines in the event
that Black takes, so I suspect Black's idea in this case was to keep the
position closed.} a5 17. Nxe7+ (17. b3 Bxd5 18. exd5 g6 $11) 17... Qxe7 18. b3
Rfd8 19. Bb2 Nc5 $132) 15... Nb6 16. f4 $6 {Now White risks being worse.} (16.
a4 {was still necessary, admitting to having made a mistake in the previous
few moves.}) 16... Re8 17. Kh1 ({What Carlsen understood, and perhaps his
opponent did not, was that the position-type after} 17. f5 $6 Bd7 {is of the
make-or-break variety for White. Given just a few moves, Black will arrange
either ...Bc6 and ...d5, or ...a5 and ...b4. Hence} 18. g4 {is the main idea,
but after} h6 {there is no follow-up; the usual h4 runs into ...Nh7 and Black
is close to winning.}) 17... Bf8 (17... exf4 $1 18. gxf4 Bf8 $15 {is
apparently better, with the idea that White will find it surprisingly
difficult to counter the simple ...Bd7-c6.}) 18. f5 Bd7 19. Qd3 (19. Ng4 $5 {
suggests itself to me, even if there is still no chance of White being better
after} Bc6 20. Nxf6+ Qxf6 21. Qd3 Qd8 $11) 19... h6 {Playing it slow because
it is hard to think up active ideas for White.} 20. b3 Bc6 21. Bd2 Qc7 22. Rac1
Qb7 {Black is done with prophylaxis and now for tactical reasons he is able to
start considering the move ...a5, or maybe ...Rcd8 and ...d5.} 23. Ned5 (23.
Ncd5 $5 {might have been a better choice, since White can think about
generating play with c4 if Black plays as in the game.} Bxd5 24. exd5 e4 25.

{gives Black an advantage; once this piece reaches the a7-g1 diagonal it will
either be unopposable or force a very favourable exchange.}) 26. Qd4 Ne5 27.
Nf2 $2 {Leaving d5 without crucial protection, but as this is a game between
humans and not machines, there are more mistakes to follow.} (27. Bxe4 $2 Nxe4
28. Qxe4 Nc4 29. Qd4 Nxd2 30. Rxe8 Rxe8 31. Qxd2 Be7 $17 {is the idea; this
position is well-nigh impossible to defend for White.}) (27. Nc3 $5 {is hard
to play, but best.} Nf3 28. Bxf3 exf3 29. Rxe8 Rxe8 30. Qf4 {Black can
sacrifice a pawn for sufficient compensation in various ways, but that is all.}
) 27... Nf3 28. Bxf3 exf3 29. c4 bxc4 30. bxc4 Re5 {The correct idea of
doubling on the e-file, but a marginally inaccurate execution. Once again
White was able to attack the weakest link in Black's construction- the f3-pawn.

complicated way}) 32... Nxd5 33. Qe4 Qb2 $1 34. Qxe2 Nf6 35. Qd3 d5 $1 $17) 31.
Re3 (31. Qd3 Rxe1+ 32. Rxe1 Qb2 33. Kg1 $15 {is similar, but without the
back-rank 'tricks'. White has time to get organised (Bb4, etc) and can then
immediately take on f3.}) 31... Rxe3 32. Qxe3 Qb2 33. Nd3 $2 {Possibly the
decisive mistake, although the computer doesn't mind it, even after thought.} (
33. Kg1 $1 Be7 34. Nd1 $1 $15 {still keeps Black's advantage within manageable
proportions}) 33... Qxa3 34. Qxf3 Qa2 35. Bc3 Rxc4 36. Ra1 Qb3 37. Bxf6 gxf6

utterly miserable.}) 38... Rc3 39. Rd1 (39. Qg4+ {is some kind of practical
try, hoping for an endgame.} Kh8 40. Nf2 Qxd5+ 41. Qe4 Qc5 $1 (41... Qxe4+ 42.

{In a lost position, White makes a sacrifice which can be refuted in a couple
of ways, but some of the other plausible answers leave him with hope of
stalemate ideas or other tricks.} Rxd3 42. Qxh5 Re3 $1 (42... Be3 {is also
good enough.}) (42... Kg7 43. Re7 Qxd5 44. Rc7 $3 {miraculously draws; White
removes his rook from the idea of ...Kf8 with tempo and will play Qg6 to pick
up the h6-bishop next!}) 0-1
