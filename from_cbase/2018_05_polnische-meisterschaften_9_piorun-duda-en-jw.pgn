{Duda's fourth win in a row. Piorun had scored 5Â½ out of 7 up to this point and was a half point ahead with Duda in second. This game was therefore crucial for both players standings.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3.

The white queenside pawns are not easy to attack, and he also limits the possibilities for the black pawn on e4.}) 16. Rxe4 dxe4 17. Qe3

$1 {This pawn grab is a theoretical innovation, but does not change the overall balanced assessment of the position. However, as Duda noticed, Piorun did not see this move coming, and in fact the defending champion may have lost his psychological balance as a result of the shock. He no longer judged the position objectively and did not find the best moves as the game progressed.} ({Previously seen was} 15... Ba6 16. Rab1 g5 17. Be3

Qb7 $2 {"Kacper has rated his position too pessimistically and must have overlooked something." (Duda) The text move is weak because the removal of the white queen from the kingside gives Black a chance to attack, requiring unwanted concessions to fend off.

{This rook can still be used effectively in the attack, and all of Black's remaining pieces are actively placed, while White's coordination is wanting, especially since Piorun's queen was sidelined on move 21.}
27. Qa5 Rd6 28. Qg5 {Piorun succeeds in bringing about an exchange of queens but only at the cost of further weakening that would lead to material losses. "White has nothing better, as black's attack is too strong." (Duda)} h3 $1 29. Qxg6 Rxg6 30. g4 Bxf3 31. g5
Ra6 {After warding off the kingside attack, White faces the tatters of his position. All his remaining pawns are weak and eventually will fall.} 32. Ra1 {White has no choice but to use his rook to defend, to avoid further material losses.} Ra3
