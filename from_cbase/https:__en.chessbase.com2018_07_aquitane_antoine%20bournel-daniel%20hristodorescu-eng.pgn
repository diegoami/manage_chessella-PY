{At this point, there remained two rounds and I was 2nd tied
with three other players half a point behind the leader. Therefore, it was absolutely necessary
to win this game if I wanted to aim for first place.}
 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Qe7 $6 
 {A dubious blow that my opponent
had already played several times and that I had prepared against.} 5. d4 Bb6 (5... exd4 {is very dangerous. I can simply castle and I'm going to have
a lot of compensation thanks to my slight development lead and the
bad placement of the black queen after opening.} 6. 0-0 $44 {with huge compensation.} )6. Bg5 Nf6 7. d5 Nd8 $1 {The knight might be stronger on d8 than on b8 if I play 8.Nbd2 (in this case, the knight from b8 could go to d7 after 8...d6), but  after the sacrifice on d6 the knight will get the strong e6-square and will be able to attack from f4 later.} (7... Nb8 $6 {The knight will be badly placed on b8 after the
pawn sacrifice on d6. My opponent had played this shot recently and
was in trouble quickly:} 8. d6 cxd6 9. 0-0 h6 10. Bxf6 Qxf6 11. Na3 a6 12. Bd5 Nc6 13. Nc4 Bc7 14. a4 b6 15. g3 $16 {White wants to open roads against the king
quickly with f4, while the black pieces are
blocked on the queenside.} )8. d6 $1 {A thematic sacrifice. I give a
pawn to turn the black structure into a kind of "prison" for the
black pieces. Actually, the c8-bishop and the a8-rook will never be able to play
if Black does not react. In addition, I get the d5-post and the d6-pawn
is still weak.} cxd6 (8... Qxd6 $6 {By exchanging queens Black will not release his pieces.} 9. Qxd6 cxd6 10. Bxf6 {
This exchange allows me to get another post on f5.} gxf6 11. Nh4 $16 {Black has difficulties freeing his pieces and has to defend
his structure filled with weaknesses.} )9. 0-0 (9. Na3 $6 Bxf2+ {It's necessary to pay attention to this tactic.} 10. Kxf2 $2 (10. Kf1 $44 )Nxe4+ 11. Kg1 Nxg5 $17 )h6 $6 {The start of the inaccuracies. Here, with precision, Black could have obtained a good position, but my
adversary did not realize that he was in danger of being dominated if he
did not look for counterplay.} (9... Ne6 $1 {Good move.  Black gives up the d6-pawn in exchange of dynamic play.} 10. Bxf6 Qxf6 11. Na3 {is what I had prepared.} (11. Qxd6 $2 {My opponent stopped here, but the d6-pawn
blocked the black pieces. With this continuation, Black will get a lot of play against my king
with his knight, his queen and a weakened white king:} Bc7 12. Qd2 Nf4 13. g3 Nh3+ 14. Kg2 d6 $13 )0-0 12. Bxe6 $1 {or Black will attack
my king with Cf4 and d5, followed by d6 to release the bishop from c8.} Qxe6 (12... fxe6 13. Qxd6 $16 )(12... dxe6 13. Qxd6 Rd8 14. Qb4 $14 {Black's queen is out of play.} )13. Nb5 $14 )(9... 0-0 $6 10. Nh4 $1 $16 {Threatening Nf5 after Bxf6.} )(9... d5 $6 {A good idea to then play d6 and free the bishop, but Black does not have time to play this shot:} 10. exd5 d6 11. Nbd2 {Threatening Ne4 to double the pawns.} h6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. Bb5+ $16)10. Bxf6 Qxf6 11. Na3 {Here I am going
simply to play Bd5 to prevent a sacrifice on d5 followed by Nc4, a4-a5. The idea is to prevent
Black from releasing his pieces.} a6 (11... d5 $6 {We must always pay attention to this move.} 12. Qxd5 d6 13. Nb5 0-0 14. Nxd6 $16 )12. Bd5 0-0 {Loses time to play b5.} (12... Bc7 $1 {Black needed to free himself quickly with b5!} 13. Nc4 Rb8 14. a4 b5 15. axb5 axb5 16. Ne3 0-0 17. g3 $14 {I am still better because Black has too many weak pawns,
but he should have played like this.} )13. Nc4 Bc7 14. a4 Rb8 15. a5 Nc6 $6 {The knight has no future here.} (15... b5 {Always a good move.} 16. axb6 Bxb6 17. b4 $16 )16. b4 Ne7 17. Nb6 {From now on, if
I can always keep a piece in d5 and b6, the bishop from c8 and the rook from b8
cannot move.} Nxd5 $6 18. Qxd5 Re8 $2 {Removes last Black's hope.} (18... Qd8 {to chase my knight and play b5.} 19. Nc4 $16 {We stay in control and threaten Rd1
followed by Cxd6.} b5 $6 20. axb6 Bxb6 21. Nxd6 $18 {Followed by Nxe5 and Black
still cannot get his pieces out. Moreover the f7-pawn is going to be
hard to defend.} )19. Nd2 $18 {My knight arrives in c4 to prevent
Blacks from chasing the one on b6. I now bring the rooks (with a knight
blocking on b6) and I'm winning.} h5 20. Ndc4 h4 21. h3 Re6 22. Rad1 Qd8 23. f4 exf4 24. Rxf4 Rf6 25. Rxh4 Qe7 26. Rg4 Qe6 27. Rd3 Bxb6+ 28. Nxb6 Qe8 29. Rdg3 {Black resigns, as he cannot defend the g7 point:} 1-0
