1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c6 4. Nbd2 f5 {The Stonewall Dutch, which this now
basically is, is a strange choice for the final round, because the nervous
tension of having to hold a statically worse position for 70 moves, with
thousands of euros on the line, could be too much for some people, even if the
positions initially appear difficult to lose.} 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Bd6 7. Ne5 O-O
8. O-O b6 9. Ndf3 Ne4 10. Bf4 {Maybe trying to bring about positions where
Black's objective best move is the rather unsolid ...g5.} Qe7 11. Rc1 {Maybe a
bit slow. Now Black gets to play ...c5.} ({The last diverging precedent
according to my database was:} 11. cxd5 cxd5 (11... exd5 12. Nd3 {holds back ..
.c5, either because of the imminent b4-push, or the tactic} c5 13. dxc5 bxc5

dxc4 14. Rxc4 Nd7 $11 {looks difficult for Black, but in reality ...c5 is
coming soon.}) 13... Nd7 (13... c5 $11 {could have been played immediately,
with approximate equality.}) 14. Nfe5 (14. cxd5 exd5 15. Nde5 Nxe5 16. Nxe5 c5
17. e3 {could still have been a little annoying for Black in an objective
sense, even though his plans (rook lifts and a kingside attack) are as plain
as day.}) 14... Nxe5 15. Nxe5 c5 {Now, as before, this push equalises, though
the justification is non-trivial.} 16. cxd5 Bxd5 $6 (16... Rad8 $1 {is an
insanely hard move to see, especially once you consider that it doesn't even
really regain the pawn.} 17. dxc5 bxc5 $1 (17... Rxd5 18. Qa4 bxc5 19. Qxa7 {
still leaves Black in difficulties}) 18. Qc2 Rxd5 19. Rfd1 g5 $1 $132) 17. dxc5

$14) 19. e3 $1 Bxa2 20. Qc2 Bd5 21. Qxc5 $14 {and Black is in trouble, because
none of the endgames are easy for him to hold.}) 18... Nf6 19. e3 ({It was a
good idea to play} 19. Bxd5 {while Black is still forced to recapture in a
manner that fails to solve his strategic problems, however after a bit of
analysis it seems that Black can liquidate down to drawish endings after the
counterplay-gaining} Nxd5 20. e3 a5 $1 $132) 19... Rac8 20. Qe2 Rfd8 21. Rfd1
Qb7 22. Bxd5 exd5 {Now Black has fully consolidated his previously wobbly
centre, and as White realised there was now not much to be tried, there were
to be no further adventures.} 23. Rc2 Rc7 24. Rdc1 Rdc8 25. Qd3 g6 26. f3 Qb6
