1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 {Black plays to win from move 2. It takes some nerve to
play this in an important game - to me this game, played in round 6, was where
the young Indian talent truly demonstrated to me that he had the full skill
set of a grandmaster, and not just a particular aptitude for calculation or
concentration.} 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. cxd5 Bxf3 5. gxf3 (5. dxc6 Bxc6 6. Nc3 {would
likely be my choice versus a higher rated opponent, on the basis that given
that the struggle is of a strategic nature I would rather it be simple.}) 5...

levels considering what an ambitious move it is.} Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 Nf6 (9... Nge7

most of this opening, properly speaking White is better but he has to be
careful of ideas that centre around ...e4 or ...Nc5.}) 8... Bxc3 9. bxc3 Qd6 {
The modern theoretical favourite. Deprived of Ba3, it is not clear how White
should proceed.} (9... Qd7 10. Rb1 O-O-O 11. Bg2 Nge7 (11... f5 $5) 12. Qb3 b6

Black has equalised.} 12. c4 $6 (12. O-O O-O {was called for, and here we have
three valid assessments: the computer thinks White is better, the human player
in a game thinks Black has the easier position to play, and the human analyst
working with a computer has no recourse but to take an average...}) 12... exd4

weakness of Black's king is an illusion. In actual fact he is already
marginally better.} 15. Bxc6 Qxc6 16. Qxd4 (16. exd4 Qxc4 17. Rc1 Qe6+ $1 $17)
16... Qxf3 (16... Rad8 $1 17. Qe5+ Kf8 18. Rg1 f6 19. Qe4 $15 {looks a lot
less clear, but in reality it is better!}) 17. Rg1 Qf6 18. Qe4+ Qe6 19. Qxe6+ (
19. Qf4 $1 {encourages Black to offer more favourable terms for the return of
the pawn.} Kf8 20. Qxc7 g6 21. Qf4 Kg7 {and Black still has a small edge on
pawn-structure grounds, but the ladies are still on the board, so lots of
things are possible.}) 19... Kxe6 20. Rxg7 Rag8 21. Rg3 h5 22. Ke2 (22. Rb3 $5
h4 23. Rxg8 Rxg8 24. Ra3 a5 25. c5 $15 {may be called for, trying simply to
reduce the pawn count so as to draw even if Black finds a way of winning one.})
22... h4 23. Rgg1 Rxg1 24. Rxg1 Rh5 {An obvious move, but a good sign of chess
maturity in children is the ability to play these rook endgames well!} 25. Rd1

be the decisive error.} (30. Kf3 {looks appealing, but for the critical detail}

a narrow path to a draw.}) 30... bxc5 31. f3 c4 $1 32. Kd2 Ra3 {It made
practical sense to play this and the next in the other order, though perhaps
the capture on c4 doesn't hold either.} 33. Ke2 (33. Rxc4 Rxa2+ 34. Kd3 h3 $1 (

kingside- but the king is too passive there to do damage.} 35. Rd4+ Kc6 36.
