Today will be one of those days: no massively special preparation, just a
brief attempt to prove a static-based plus and if it doesn't work then agree a
draw.} Nc6 11. Bd3 Bb6 12. O-O Qf6 (12... Bg4 {has been Nakamura's previous
choice in this position.} 13. h3 Bh5 14. b4 a6 15. Be2 $1 {The move the
engines want, with the visually appealing idea of Ra2-d2. It also ties down
the Qd8 and prevents d4. It is not unreasonable to suspect that this may have
been a wrinkle Karjakin had in mind. It has been played in a smattering of
2500 or low 2600 games but no elite ones.} (15. Rc1 d4 16. g4 Bg6 17. e4 $13 {
