exd5 O-O 9. O-O cxd5 10. Bg5 c6 11. Qf3 {It is interesting how these things
change. In 2008 this line was taught to me from the White side by
Ukrainian-Israeli GM Boris Alterman; shortly after became an IM (in 2011) I
viewed it as primarily a drawing weapon and now I think it's just a way to get
a long and strategically messy game which the better player will probably win.
That is in fact what occurred.} Bd6 (11... Rb8 12. h3 {probably brings White a
little bit closer to his dream of Na4, b3, c4, Bf4 and Rad1.}) (11... Be7 {
is more played and is most solid, but the doubled f-pawns are not something to
get that scared about.}) 12. Rae1 {Possibly preparation, but in any case quite
logical to take the e5-square from Black's bishop.} (12. h3 {is main, and now
a tactic worth knowing is} Rb8 13. b3 Be5 14. Bf4 $5 {although it doesn't
necessarily promise White anything after} Bxc3 15. Bxb8 Bxa1 16. Rxa1 Bg4 17.
hxg4 Qxb8 $11 {as in Morozevich,A -Kramnik,V Moscow 2013. However, we were not
destined to see another bishop-vs- knight-and-solid-d5-centre draw this round.}

{tries to take advantage of White's tactically vulnerable pieces. There could
follow:} 14. Qg3 Bd7 {and I assume Carlsen saw this and steered clear due to
the drawing line} 15. Qh4 $1 h6 16. Bxh6 $11) 14. h3 h6 15. Bxf6 Qxf6 16. Qxf6
gxf6 17. Ne2 c5 18. Ng3 Rd8 19. Nf5 {So White has emerged with a marginally
more comfortable position from the opening, but Black isn't giving up on
trying to win just yet.} Bf8 $1 {Bishops of the same colour always offer more
imbalance, and in this case White needs to be concerned about the ...c4 push
too.} (19... Bxf5 20. Bxf5 a4 21. g3 axb3 22. axb3 Be5 $11 {would be a
reasonably solid way to make a draw}) 20. Ne7+ Bxe7 21. Rxe7 Be6 22. Rd1 (22.
Ra7 $1 {As always, White should exchange precisely one pair of rooks, and this
poses Black some significant problems.} Ra8 (22... c4 23. Be2 {is inconvenient
for Black as he doesn't obtain enough in case of ...c4, but also bad is} Ra8

yesterday, and a Rubinstein game about 100 years ago: the isolated rook's pawn
is often a major weakness.}) 25. g4 fxg4 26. f5 Bd7 27. hxg4 Re8 $11) 22... c4
23. Be2 a4 {Now Black is having some fun: possibly Adhiban missed from afar
that ...Rxc2 can pin a bishop to a c7-rook a few moves into certain lines.} 24.
bxa4 Bf5 $6 {Either an inaccuracy or a slight gamble. Either way, it makes the
game look a bit less 'smooth' given that it is a win in the end, but also
increased the likelihood of that being the result.} (24... Kf8 25. Rc7 Rb2 $132

the accidental chance.} (25. c3 $1 Ra8 (25... d4 26. Bxc4 dxc3 27. Rxd8+ Rxd8
28. Bb3 $14) 26. Rc7 $1 {The point is that White can use the pin on the d-file,
and for this reason Black is unable to take on a4. For instance:} Be6 27. f4 f5

suggestion but following} d3 $5 {it is also a bit depressing, e.g.} 28. cxd3 (

and the endgame should be held, especially at this level: bishop goes to f5 and
is supported by g4, for instance, but it requires a certain appetite for
suffering to go in for this.}) 26... Bxc2 $19 27. Rc1 Rb1 28. Rxb1 Bxb1 29. Rc7

game!} 0-1
