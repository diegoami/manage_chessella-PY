1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Bf5 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. a3 Nf6 6. Bg5 Be7 7. e3 {The
structure is similar to QGD, but there are a few things which are not the same.
The bishop on f5 is much more active, but the knight on c6 looks misplaced.}
Ne4 8. Bxe7 Nxe7 9. Rc1 O-O 10. Be2 dxc4 11. Bxc4 Rc8 12. Bd3 Nxc3 13. Rxc3
Bxd3 14. Rxd3 {Playing against the freeing move ...c5.} (14. Qxd3 c5 $11) 14...
Qd5 15. O-O Rfd8 16. Rd2 Nf5 17. Qa4 Nd6 18. Rc1 {White has some presure here
as Black is not able to free his position with e5 or c5 breaks.} Qb5 19. Qxb5
Nxb5 20. Rdc2 c6 21. Kf1 f6 22. Ke2 Kf7 23. Ne1 $1 {The knight will be better
placed on d3.} Rc7 24. Nd3 Re7 25. a4 Nd6 26. b4 Ke8 27. Rc5 Ne4 28. R5c2 Nd6
29. h4 {White is gaining space all over the board. While currently nothing
concrete can be seen out of it, after a point this will become useful.} a5 30.
b5 $5 (30. Rb1 $1 $14) 30... cxb5 31. axb5 b6 (31... Nxb5 32. Rc5 $14) 32. Rc6
Rb7 33. Nf4 {Adhiban goes for active play. He has weakened his b5 pawn in
return for other weaknesses in Black's position.} Kd7 34. d5 $1 {Alert as ever.
} exd5 (34... e5 35. Ne6 $16) 35. Nxd5 Nxb5 36. Rxb6 Rxb6 37. Nxb6+ Ke6 38. Rc5
Nd6 39. Rxa5 {White has won a pawn but the technical task of converting it
into a win is not easy. At the same time, facing Adhiban in this pawn down
position is also not particularly easy!} Ne4 40. Kf3 Nd2+ 41. Kf4 g5+ {This
tactical operation only creates a further weakness.} 42. hxg5 fxg5+ 43. Kg4 $1
(43. Rxg5 Rf8+ $11) 43... Ne4 44. f3 Nf6+ 45. Kxg5 Rg8+ 46. Kf4 Rxg2 {The
material is reduced further but now White has two passers.} 47. Re5+ Kf7 48.
Nd5 {Funnily the exchange of knights cannot be prevented.} Nxd5+ 49. Rxd5 $18 {
This is now a trivial win.} Kg6 50. Rd6+ Kg7 51. Kf5 h5 52. Rd7+ Kh6 53. f4 h4

found the way to break the blockade.} Rg1+ 66. Kf2 Rg8 67. Rg5 Re8 68. Kg3 $1 {
Who needs two, when one can win.} Rxe6 69. Kg4 Re8 70. Rg7 Kd5 71. Kg5 Re1 72.
f5 Kd6 73. Kg6 {The rank cut off is a powerful weapon.} Re8 74. Ra7 {A great
technical effort by Adhiban.} 1-0
