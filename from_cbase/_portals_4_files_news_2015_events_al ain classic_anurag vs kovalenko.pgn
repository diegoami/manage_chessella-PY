{It seems like White is creating play with the passed pawn and the Queen on
the 7th rank although it does not look very dangerous. But Kovalenko found a
nice counterattacking tactic that turned the situation completely.} 23... Be6
$1 24. Bxe6 $6 {Anurag probably chose to try his luck in the dynamic
complications instead of the static disadvantage. Or maybe he misjudged the
resulting posiion.} (24. Bf3 Rd7 $15 {followed by doubling the Rooks on the
d-file is a comfortable advantage for Black.}) 24... Qe4+ 25. Kg1 Rd2 26. Rf2
Rxf2 27. Kxf2 Qd4+ 28. Kg2 Qxa1 $19 {Black is winning.} 0-1
