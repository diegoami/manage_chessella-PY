{Saving the best to last, here is the effort by Fabiano Caruana, who needed to
win in order to again catch 'the man who knows nothing' in the tournament lead.
As such, the game begins with a reversed Dragon.} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3

had already been seen by Caruana from the other side of the table, and the
game may have inspired him.} Qd8 10. Nxh7 Re8 11. Ng5 {The knight is protected
by d4-tricks!} Qxg5 12. Bxc6 (12. d4 Qe7 13. dxc5 Qxc5 14. Qa4 {could be a new
direction for White to investigate}) 12... bxc6 13. d4 Qh5 (13... Qe7 14. dxc5

our silicon friends- Black can take back on c5 if he chooses in a better
version than 13...Qe7.}) 16. Bf4 Qh3 17. Qd4 Bg4 18. Qe3 Rad8 19. Rad1 $14 {
The compensation was close to vanishing into thin air in Aronian,L-Caruana,F,
Saint Louis 2017}) 8... Re8 9. Ng5 Nf6 (9... Nxc3 {These structures are always
evaluated as equal by the machine, but in my experience they are always better
for one side or the other. A good indicator of whether Black is better is
whether he has traded his dark square bishop for the knight.} 10. bxc3 Be7 {
Now here are 2 sample lines, one where Black ends up better and one where
White does. The point is not that Ne4 is better or that Nf3 is but that the
position contains a vast number of apparently minor nuances, such that one
side will on balance of probabilities understand them better over the next 5
moves.} 11. Ne4 (11. Nf3 Be6 12. Rb1 b6 13. Qa4 Qd7 14. Ng5 Nd4 15. Qd1 Bxg5

equal position, but maybe Black is easier to play as in the Wesley So game.})

As before, trading the knight for the dark square bishop is not often a good
idea.} Nxd4 17. Re1 Bg4 $15) (16. e3 $11) 16... Bxe3 17. fxe3 e4 (17... Nd8 {

problem is that he is now 'likely' to 'forget' to take the material back.} (25.

carried away with strategic purity. It turns out that for tactical reasons
White can now keep the pawn.} 35. Nd4 Nxd4 36. exd4 Rg3 37. Rf3 $1 $14 {
That's just it. The rook is entombed and White's pawns have been untripled (!)}

most sophisticated way of giving back the exchange, setting up an outpost for
the rook on b3 and the queen on d5.}) 39. Kh2 Rxg2+ 40. Kxg2 Rd5 41. Rc4 c5 42.

the idea of Rxb7 in various lines.} (45. Rb8 Rd1 {is not a good way to
introduce that idea}) 45... g5 46. Re7 Kg8 (46... Kf8 47. Rxb7 {leads to
another probably-winning queen ending.}) 47. e6 $1 {The best conversion,
forcing a queen rather than rook ending on pain of mate.} fxe6 48. Qc2 Kf8 49.

probably-winning rook ending, but see Black's 58th.} (50. Rh8+ Ke7 51. Qh7+ Kd6

More moves could have been played, but White has shown enough. This move
eliminates the pawn at a4 and gets back to cover the c-pawn just in time.} 1-0
