O-O 9. h3 Nb8 {The famously solid Breyer variation! Similar in character to
some games of mine that began with the move 1.d4 b5, Black's play in this line
is extremely formulaic and rarely deviates from well-established and easily
understood plans. A good sign of mastery is to be able to combine elements
from different plans as the game dictates.} 10. d4 (10. d3 $5 {is another move,
recently used against Mamedyarov by the young Spanish GM David Anton. The
logic is that Black has spent time on ...Nb8 that he probably wouldn't have
done against an earlier d3-system. For instance:} Nbd7 11. Nbd2 Bb7 12. Nf1 Re8
13. Ng3 $132 {and White can contemplate playing with Nh2-g4 in place of the
standard d4, Bc2 stuff.}) 10... Nbd7 11. Nbd2 Bb7 (11... c5 {The reason this
move order is not played, is that Black would like White to have to play a4
before Black goes c4.} 12. Nf1 Re8 13. Ng3 Bf8 14. Ng5 {The point. Now there
is no real choice other than c4, and then Black has to go for tricks.} c4 15.
Bc2 exd4 $5 (15... h6 16. Nf3 Bb7 17. d5 g6 18. Be3 {is exactly what Black
doesn't want: counterplay is slow to arrive because White doesn't have a4 yet,
and White may continue with Nh2-g4 or Qd2, etc.}) 16. cxd4 Bb7 17. Bd2 g6 $132
{Black's play now is aimed at making the knight on g5 feel silly. Nevertheless,
he doesn't have quite enough pressure on e4 and the feeling is that White must
be better somehow, perhaps with a4 under the now-different circumstances.}) 12.
Bc2 Re8 13. Nf1 Bf8 14. Ng3 g6 15. a4 (15. Nh2 {is an interesting creative
move:} exd4 16. cxd4 c5 17. d5 $11 {In this kind of position it's hard to know
how much weight to give to the opinion of the machine, but Black should not be
worse if he follows normal plans (...Bg7, ...c4, ...Nc5, possibly ...h5.) See
Motycakova,M-Nemcova,K Frydek Mistek 2009.}) (15. b3 $5 {A conceptually
challenging line. White wants to get d5 without a4, and not have it punished
by ...c6 and detonation of the centre. Black must react carefully, and I am
not sure quite how to equalise here, though there is a very interesting piece
sacrifice which gives excellent compensation.} Bg7 (15... c5 16. d5 $14) (15...
d5 16. Bg5 h6 17. Bh4 $14 {seems to have been pioneered by Mamedyarov and
analysed down to a draw, but cloud engines disagree! The consensus will
probably change soon...}) 16. d5 Rc8 17. c4 {This was White's point.} c6 18.
Be3 (18. dxc6 Rxc6 19. cxb5 axb5 20. Bd3 b4 $11 {Berg,E-Butnorius,A Gibraltar
2008}) 18... Nb6 $1 {Now for concrete reasons this is best.} (18... Qa5 {
is suggested by the engine, but following} 19. a3 bxc4 20. bxc4 Nc5 21. Qd2
Qxd2 22. Nxd2 Nfd7 23. Rab1 $14 {the queens have come off and Black is quite
passive}) 19. Qe2 $1 {Other moves have been tried, but this is the most
convincing for White.} cxd5 20. cxd5 Nbxd5 {If not for this move White would
be trivially better.} 21. exd5 Nxd5 22. Rac1 $1 {The only way to take back on
e3 with a piece.} (22. Qd2 Nxe3 23. fxe3 e4 24. Nd4 Bxd4 25. exd4 e3 26. Qe2
Qh4 27. Kh2 Qxd4 {is not what White was looking for from the opening}) 22...
Nxe3 (22... Nc3 23. Qd2 $14) 23. Qxe3 d5 $44 {Black has good compensation
based on the big centre.}) 15... Nb6 $5 {Not a move I had seen before, but
perhaps it will be seen more in light of the present game.} (15... c5 {This is
the main line. White is only given liberty to close the centre after he has
played a4. Here I have some quite detailed analysis but suffice it to say in
summary that Black faces some slight problems according to the present theory,
largely depending on how fast he allows tripling on the a-file.} 16. d5 c4 17.
Bg5 $1 {White is trying to cross or delay Black's usual knight redeployment of
Nc5, Nfd7.} Bg7 $1 (17... h6 $6 {is less strong, and a simple plan for White
can be formulated, involving... tripling on the a-file. Far from gaining a
tempo, ...h6 in fact loses one. I will give some sample lines.} 18. Be3 Nc5 19.
Qd2 h5 20. Ra3 Qc7 (20... Nfd7 21. Rea1 Nb6 {Else just R1a2, Qc1-a1, etc.} 22.
a5 Nba4 {Interesting idea, but probably bad.} 23. Rb1 $1 Bg7 24. Nf1 $14 {
The idea is just Qd1, N1d2, Nxc4 and there is not a lot Black can do about it.}

27. Bd2 Nf6 28. Ng5 Reb8 29. Nf1 {White has gained a marginally more pleasant
position and will be able to triple on the a-file if desired, however if Black
plays completely precisely the advantage will grow, and as we all know, with
almost nothing on the board 0.3 is a draw!}) 18. Qd2 Nc5 19. Ra3 (19. Nh2 Qc7

{Black is just about on time, for instance:} 22. R1a2 Nd3 $132) (15... Bg7 $5 {
is an interesting attempt to dodge the main line- Black is fine to play with ..
.c6 in place of ...c5, and keep the position compact and solid in a
Philidor-like way.} 16. Bd3 {Otherwise Black gets ...c5, free of the problems
outlined above.} c6 17. Be3 (17. Bg5 {encourages Black's concept:} Nf8 18. Qd2
Ne6 19. Be3 Nd7 $11 {Black is fine as in Hou,Y-Sasikiran,K New Delhi 2011.})
17... Qc7 $132 {Black is playing for ...d5 and whether White has an edge
depends heavily on whether he can sufficiently discourage this move in the
coming phase. One motif to pay attention to is the dark-square complex. Anand
has been on the White side of this: Anand,V-Baramidze,D Baden-Baden 2015}) 16.
axb5 (16. a5 Nbd7 17. b4 $5 {was an audacious concept in Caruana,F-Roiz,M
Bilbao 2014- White is trying to play d5, lock down the centre as well as the
queenside and only subsequently (and extremely slowly) make progress with the
kingside attack. The idea could, however, have come slightly unstuck against
the principled} exd4 18. cxd4 c5 19. bxc5 dxc5 20. d5 c4 $132) (16. b3 $5 {
is possibly more ambitious than the text- White wants Bd3, c4, d5.} bxa4 {
may be the best way to counter this:} 17. bxa4 a5 18. Bd3 Qc8 $132 {Black has
reasonable play according to current knowledge as in Adams,M-Tan,J Bournemouth
2016, but Black's position looks slightly looser than usual, so there may be
an incisive way for White to get an edge.}) 16... axb5 17. Bg5 Bg7 18. Bd3 Rxa1

solid in any case.}) 20... Qc7 21. dxe5 dxe5 22. Qc1 Bc8 23. Qc2 {The last two
moves do not create a great impression, but White has a very wide margin of
error in such positions.} Nfd7 24. c4 {This move looks like White has
reconciled himself to offering a draw soon.} Nxc4 25. Bxc4 bxc4 26. Qxc4 Nf8

30. Qxc1 Qxc1 31. Bxc1 Ne6 $36 {Black has full compensation for the pawn
despite the reduced material and his bishop pair means his game is more
pleasant.}) 28. Nf1 Ne6 29. N1d2 Qa5 30. Ng5 Nxg5 31. Bxg5 Bf8 32. Be3 {
With a draw offer which was accepted.} (32. Nb3 Qb5 33. Qc3 {was maybe worth
considering, as on strategic purity White is still marginally ahead.
Definitely below super-GM level there is a strong chance that White will
consolidate a dark-square bind, e.g. Be3-c5, Nd2, b4, f3, Kh2.}) 1/2-1/2
