1. Nf3 d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 {Probably trying for some clever
move-order trick in a Meran.} b6 (4... a6 5. b3 Bd6 6. Bb2 O-O 7. g4 $5 $132 {
was the experimental continuation of Nepomniachtchi,I -Anand,V London 2017}) (
4... Bb4 $5 {has an equally 'interesting' flavour:} 5. a3 (5. Qa4+ Nc6 6. Nd4
a5 $132) 5... Bxc3 6. bxc3 O-O 7. Bb2 $5 {Trying to open the long diagonal
quickly, but Black has a gambit idea.} (7. d4 c5 {Via a circuituous route, we
have reached a main line Samisch position.}) 7... c5 8. cxd5 exd5 9. c4 d4 $5
$132) (4... c5 {is of course fine, when White's main independent continuation
could be the attempt to force an IQP position with} 5. cxd5 {. However, Black
is under no obligation to accept this and can continue} Nxd5 $5 6. d4 cxd4 7.
exd4 Nxc3 8. bxc3 Qc7 9. Bd2 Nd7 $132 {as in Aronian,L-Carlsen,M London 2015})
5. b3 Bb7 6. Bb2 Nbd7 7. g3 $5 {Ducking d4 at any cost.} Bd6 (7... dxc4 {
seems logical to try and punish White's omission. For instance,} 8. Bxc4 (8.
bxc4 e5 9. Bg2 e4 $36) 8... a6 9. O-O (9. a4 Bb4 $11 {is also very comfortable}
) 9... b5 10. Be2 Be7 $11) 8. Bg2 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Rc1 a6 11. Qe2 dxc4 (11...
c5 $6 {was correctly avoided:} 12. cxd5 exd5 (12... Nxd5 13. Nxd5 exd5 14. d4 {
is similar}) 13. d4 {Black does not have a good version of the hanging pawns
position.}) 12. bxc4 b5 $5 {Liquidating.} (12... c5 13. Ng5 Bxg2 14. Kxg2 {
leads to a position reminiscent of the 6.b3 Catalan discussed yesterday; both
sides have glaring backward pawns but White is probably slightly more
comfortable unless Black hurries to get pieces off with (say)} Be5 $1 15. f4
Bxc3 16. Bxc3 e5 $11) 13. cxb5 axb5 14. Nxb5 Rxa2 15. d4 ({It is a running
joke in my circle that whenever possible, I will suggest moves like} 15. Bxf6 {
to try and exploit, after a further 50 moves, some perceived superiority of
White's compact structure. This may or may not be present, but on objective
grounds the move deserves consideration. Play could continue} Nxf6 16. Nfd4
Bxg2 17. Kxg2 Ne4 18. Rfd1 $11 {when White has the 'threat' of Nc3, exchanging
off more pieces and thus getting closer to the ideal RB v RN position, where
in theory the backward c-pawn could become a factor.}) 15... Qb8 16. Ra1 Rxa1
17. Rxa1 Bf8 18. Nc3 c5 19. Rb1 {Maybe a slightly slack move.} (19. Qb5 cxd4

created a threat and would not have been a totally unreasonable move to play
on with.} 22. Ba1 Qa8+ 23. Qf3 Qa3 24. Ndb5 Qa6 $11 {and while the position is
objectively level, White's pieces are a little bit tangled up and a bit less
active.}) 1/2-1/2
