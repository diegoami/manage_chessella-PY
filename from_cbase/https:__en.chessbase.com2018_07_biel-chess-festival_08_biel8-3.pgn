1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 Bc5 5. Bxc6 dxc6 $8 6. Nbd2 {This is the
most common move, but no less than five other options also have been tried in
the opponents' practice.} Be6 ({Instead,} 6... Bg4 7. h3 Bh5 {had been played
by Carlsen in his 2013 world championship match against Anand.}) 7. Qe2 $5 Nd7
8. Nb3 {Introduced by Caruana in a game against Navara in 2013.} Bb6 $5 9. Ng5
Nf8 $5 10. Be3 $146 ({In Caruana-Nakamura, Internet blitz 2017 there was} 10.
O-O Bxb3 11. axb3 f6 12. Nf3 Ne6 {, transposing also to Caruana-Kramnik,
Leuven blitz 2016.}) ({There is also} 10. Nxe6 Nxe6 $11) 10... Qe7 ({Engines
suggest} 10... Bd7 $5 {, planning ...Ng6.}) 11. g3 ({Probably more accurate is
} 11. Nxe6 Nxe6 12. Qh5) 11... Bxb3 $5 12. axb3 f6 13. Nf3 Ne6 14. Bxb6 cxb6
15. O-O a6 $1 {Instead of the banal 15...0-0, Carlsen prepares the long castle.
} 16. c3 ({Maybe} 16. Qe3 $5 {was worth trying.}) 16... O-O-O {If White would
not have prepared d4 now, Black could get some attacking prospects on the
kingside.} 17. Rad1 Kb8 18. Qe3 Ka7 {A true magic. The black king is
completely safe on the queenside. Black gradually gained some chances from
what seemed to be a completely equal position.} 19. d4 exd4 20. Nxd4 ({After} 
20. cxd4 $6 Rhe8 {White's pawns are vulnerable.}) 20... Nxd4 21. Rxd4 h5 $5 22.
Rfd1 $5 Rxd4 23. cxd4 ({After} 23. Rxd4 {Black plays} h4 ({or} 23... Qe6 24. b4
h4)) 23... h4 24. d5 ({A serious alternative was} 24. g4 {but also there some
initiative is with Black.}) 24... hxg3 25. hxg3 Qe5 ({Curious is} 25... cxd5 $5
26. exd5 (26. Rxd5 g5 $1) 26... Qxe3 27. fxe3 Kb8 $1 {though I am not sure
that Black has any significant winning chances after} 28. d6 $5) 26. Qf3 ({Not
} 26. dxc6 $4 Qh5 $1 $19) 26... cxd5 27. exd5 Qxb2 $6 ({Here} 27... Rd8 $1 28.
Qd3 Qxb2 29. d6 Qe5 ({if} 29... Rd7 {, White plays} 30. Qf5 $1 Qxb3 31. Qxd7
Qxd1+ 32. Kg2 $11 {with the inevitable draw, because the d6-pawn is too
dangerous}) 30. d7 Qe6 {was a better practical chance: Black plans to play,
approximately, ...Qc6, b5, b6, Kb7 at some point threatening with ...Rh8, or ..
.a5-a4. At least, White would have had to work for a draw.}) 28. d6 $1 Rd8 29.
d7 Qc2 {Now White uses the opportunity to place his rook actively, equalizing.}
30. Rd6 $1 Qc5 31. Qd1 $1 $11 Qf5 32. Rd5 Qe4 33. Rd4 Qc6 34. Rd6 Qe4 35. Rd4
