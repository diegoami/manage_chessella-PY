1. d4 e6 {Earlier on in the Festival, in the open tournament, I employed this
move order rather than ...Nf6 so as to permit the wrinkle 2.c4 Bb4+ followed
by an ...f5 setup. The order also dodges the Nc3 Dutch and allows a quick ...
c5 against Nf3 or g3. However, of course, the French must be in your
repertoire.} 2. Nf3 c5 3. g3 (3. e4 {Some kind of Sicilian that is not the
Dragon or Classical must also be in your repertoire. If you are a Najdorf
player, you must be willing to play ...e6 rather than ...e5 setups.}) 3... cxd4
4. Nxd4 Qb6 (4... d5 {is main, and seems to equalise straightfowardly since
White cannot really arrange c4 under desirable circumstances.}) 5. Bg2 Bc5 6.
e3 (6. c3 Nf6 7. O-O d5 8. Nd2 {intending e4 is another valid way to play,
though it sacrifices a pawn in various ways}) 6... d5 7. Qg4 $6 $11 {e3 goes
with c4. In spite of this move appearing to force some concessions, maybe
White should have stuck to the plan.} (7. O-O Nf6 8. c4 $36 {was probably the
way to ask some probing questions.}) 7... Bf8 {Trying to play without
weaknesses.} (7... g6 {is not ridiculous either}) 8. O-O Nf6 9. Qe2 e5 (9...
Nc6 {avoids the doubled pawn scenario}) 10. Qb5+ Bd7 11. Qxb6 axb6 12. Nb3 Nc6
13. Bd2 Bd6 14. Nc3 Ne7 15. a4 O-O (15... Rc8 $11 {delays Nb5 by a tempo which
may be important. Certainly since the rook came here anyway in the end this
was a more internally consistent order.}) 16. Nb5 Bxb5 17. axb5 $14 {It seems
to me that White has nevertheless managed to get a little something, though
the position continues to be strategically confusing.} Rac8 18. Bc3 h5 19. Rfd1
Rfd8 20. Nd2 {White has an advantage, but as so often with the bishop pair in
closed positions it is hard to work with. White chooses a logical plan of
trying to get the knight to g5.} (20. Ra7 {appeals somewhere round here; as
White I would probably like to double rooks on the a-file, exchange one pair
of them, arrange the bishops on e1 and d1 and maybe play toward g4. (As every
grandmaster knows, the bishops control most squares from the back rank. Thus,
you will often see them win the bishop pair and then store the two boys away
on e1 and f1.)}) 20... h4 (20... Ne8 21. Nf3 f6 {deserved consideration}) 21.
Nf3 hxg3 22. hxg3 e4 {Keeping the game strategically messy.} (22... Ne4 $14 {
was playable, but admits to being worse.}) 23. Ng5 (23. Nd4 $14 {was a much
better move, not being constrained by his own previous plan of putting the
knight on g5. For instance} Be5 24. Bh3 Rb8 25. Ra4 {and White will ultimately
play for c4.}) 23... Ng6 24. Ra7 $14 {So White has acheived what I wanted
anyway. It would have been much more fitting to annotate this game as a White
win, but Black reminds us that there is still a lot going on in the game
strategically (e.g. the idea of ...Be5.)} Rb8 25. Bd4 Bc5 26. Bxc5 bxc5 27. c4
Ne7 (27... Re8 $14 {was better according to the engine, but would be
depressing to play. As a human you want all your pieces to do work, and here
the knight on g6 isn't performing well.}) 28. cxd5 Nc8 29. Ra4 Nb6 30. Ra3 Nc4
31. Rc3 Nd6 32. Rxc5 Ra8 33. Bh3 {Probably a step in the wrong direction, even
if the computer sees no problem. The problem is that White is now playing for
strings of (albeit high level) tactical tricks.} (33. Nh3 $14 {was the right
idea, if not the right implementation: this knight should be on f4 or d4 or
something, not playing for tricks on the kingside.}) 33... Re8 {Playing with
the motif of trapping the knight.} 34. Rc7 Kf8 (34... Re5 $4 {runs into a
forced piece sacrifice:} 35. Nxf7 Nxf7 36. Be6 Rf8 37. Rxb7 $18) 35. b6 (35.
Be6 {was tempting but Black will just ignore it.} Re7 36. Rxe7 Kxe7 37. Bh3 Rh8
$11) 35... Re5 36. Ne6+ (36. Nxf7 $11 {was a better way to give the piece and
now White probably keeps dynamic equality}) 36... fxe6 37. dxe6 Nfe8 38. Rd7
Raa5 {Now Black has completely turned the tables and gets to finish the event
above 50%!} 39. b4 (39. R1xd6 Nxd6 40. Rxd6 Rad5 {was objectively best but in
a human game this ending would be absolute hell to defend.}) 39... Rad5 40. Ra1
Rb5 $17 {Now the knights and e5-rook hold White's play back while the b5-rook
takes stuff.} 41. Ra8 Rxb6 42. Bg4 Rd5 43. Kg2 Rxb4 44. Ra1 Rbb5 45. Be2 Rb2
46. Bg4 Rdd2 47. Kh3 Rxf2 48. Kh4 Rh2+ 49. Bh3 g5+ 50. Kh5 Rxh3+ 51. Kg6 Rf2
52. e7+ Kg8 53. Rxd6 Rh7 {Finally either taking the pawn or setting up mate
tactics (...Rg7 and either ...g4 or ...Kf7)} 0-1
