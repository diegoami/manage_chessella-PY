d'etre of this move, since both ...Bf5 and ...Bg4 are more 'conventional' Slav
choices, and both should equalise. So annotating this game and finding Black's
equalising methods was a learning experience for me too.} 5. O-O Nbd7 (5... b5

cedes the bishop pair but keeps his pawn. Some brief theoretical notes follow,
though I have not found any significant improvement on the main 'draw line'-
