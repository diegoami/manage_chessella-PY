{On top board yesterday, a prodigy made a solid draw from what might have
looked a nightmare pairing- Black against the top seed.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3.
Nc3 c6 4. e3 Nf6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6. Ne5 Bb4 7. Bd2 O-O 8. Be2 c5 {Due to White's
quiet setup, I would say Black has already equalised.} 9. O-O (9. a3 Bxc3 10.
Bxc3 Nxe5 11. dxe5 Ne4 $11) 9... cxd4 10. exd4 dxc4 11. Nxc4 (11. a3 {looks
like a better way to get the bishop pair (compared to the last note) but now
Black uses the d5-square and long diagonal to good effect.} Nxe5 12. dxe5 Bxc3
13. Bxc3 Nd5 14. Bd4 Nf4 15. Bf3 $5 (15. Bxc4 b5 $1 $132) 15... Nd3 16. Bc3 Qb6
$44 {White will get enough play, but not more.}) 11... Nb6 12. Bg5 (12. Na4 $5
Bxd2 13. Naxb6 axb6 14. Qxd2 {fails to get an objective advantage, but the
structural weakness combines well with a rating superiority.}) 12... Nxc4 13.
Bxc4 Bd7 ({On principle, since White is about to question the Black bishop
pair, it makes sense to question White's first:} 13... h6 $1 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 15.
Qb3 Bd6 $11) 14. Qb3 Bxc3 (14... Be7 15. Rad1 Bc6 16. Rfe1 {is not a disaster,
but not fun for Black either with d5 coming soon, unless the tactics after ...
Qa5 work.} (16. d5 $5 {is simpler to calculate without an engine:} Nxd5 17.
Bxd5 exd5 18. Bxe7 Qxe7 19. Nxd5 Bxd5 20. Rxd5 Rad8 21. Rfd1 $11 {and Black
has to play a couple more accurate moves to show his equality.})) 15. bxc3 Bc6
{It requires great maturity from the Black player- certainly more than I have
at my present age of 23- to notice that despite the White bishop pair and pin
on the h4-d8 diagonal, things are actually going just fine.} 16. Rfe1 Rc8 17.
Bf1 a6 {Thinking, presumably, of playing both ...Qd5 and ...Bb5.} 18. Re3 $6 {
Now there is no hope of an advantage.} (18. Bh4 $5 {leads to a position which
might not be better, but certainly demands a bit more coolness from Black.})
18... Qd5 19. Bxf6 (19. Bf4 Bb5 $1 {is the point behind Black's 17th.}) 19...
gxf6 20. Qd1 b5 $1 21. a4 Kh8 22. axb5 axb5 23. Rg3 Rg8 24. Ra7 (24. Ra5 Rxg3
25. hxg3 Kg7 26. Qb1 Qd6 $1 {doesn't give anything either, because whenever
White takes b5, in the very same action c3 will drop, and there is no other
White plan that makes sense.}) 24... e5 $1 {Protecting f7 and simplifying.} 25.
Qd2 exd4 26. cxd4 Rxg3 27. hxg3 Kg7 28. Qb4 Ra8 $1 29. Rxa8 Bxa8 30. Qxb5 (30.
Qc5 Qe4 $1 {is an only move, but good enough. Tactics prevent both the
immediate capture of the b5-pawn and any kind of preparatory idea like f3.})
30... Qxd4 {There is nothing left to play for, and the requisite 30 moves have
been made.} 1/2-1/2
