1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 Bb4+ 4. Bd2 a5 5. Bg2 {After the previous night's
experience I wasn't in the mood for another game in Bogo structures.} d5 {
Now it's a Catalan.} 6. Qc2 $5 {A tricky move order. White wants to rule out
all dxc4 lines.} ({I was hoping for} 6. Nf3 dxc4 7. Qc2 Bxd2+ 8. Qxd2 b5 {
albeit even with a marginal theoretical knowledge White shouldn't end up worse.
}) 6... Nc6 ({I didn't spend much time on} 6... O-O 7. Nf3 {as I had only
vague recollections of the state of theory in the principled} c5 {line.} ({
and the standard Closed Catalan} 7... c6 {looked pretty dull to me.})) 7. Nf3
dxc4 8. Qxc4 Qd5 {This variation is associated with two great players, Smyslov
and Taimanov. Over the years it was on and off tried by many, myself included.}
9. Qxd5 ({Once I lost a game to Greg Kaidanov after} 9. Qd3 Qe4 ({but this
time I was planning} 9... Qf5)) 9... exd5 10. O-O Bg4 {I was hoping to provoke
e2-e3, but White has other options.} 11. Be3 ({Among other choices interesting
is} 11. Rd1 Bxf3 12. exf3 Bxd2 13. Rxd2 {White accepts a slighly damaged pawn
structure, but has hopes for active play.}) 11... O-O-O {It's always a big
question in this variation whether or not Black should abandon the a-file with
his rook.} ({While I didn't want to relieve the tension on d4,} 11... Ne7 12.
Bf4 $14) ({the possibility of} 11... a4 {went underappreciated, mainly because
in case of} 12. Rc1 {I failed to consider the strong move} Ne4 $5 {which stops}
13. Nc3 $2 {on account of} a3 $1) 12. h3 ({On} 12. a3 {I planned} Be7 13. Nc3
Ne4 14. Rac1 Bf6 {Basically, Black is no hurry to remove his Nc6, because it
helps to pressurize d4, while keeping White from playing his own knight to e5.}
) 12... Bxf3 {I wanted to facilitate my play.} 13. Bxf3 Ne4 14. Rd1 f5 15. a3
Be7 16. Nc3 g5 17. Nb5 Bf6 18. Rac1 Rhe8 {[#] I had played Peter Berelos
before. He may not be a very imaginative player, but he's solid, and it is
really hard to beat him without tactical play. Looking at this position after
all those obligatory moves both players had made I saw very little room for
tactics.} 19. Bd2 {Having spotted the threat of Nxg3 Peter reflectively moved
the bishop.} ({White could have ignored Black's obvious threat, and simply go} 
19. Kg2 {The thing is,} Nxg3 20. Kxg3 f4+ 21. Bxf4 gxf4+ 22. Kg2 Kb8 23. Rc5
Re7 24. Rd3 {leads to a boring position where neither side seem to be able to
do much.}) {Suddenly I saw an opportunity to stir up something.} 19... Nxd2 $5
20. Rxd2 g4 21. hxg4 Bg5 22. e3 Rxe3 23. fxe3 Bxe3+ 24. Kg2 Bxd2 25. Rd1 Bg5
26. gxf5 {It didn't come out to much of anything, but at least the position is
somewhat unbalanced.} Ne7 27. g4 c6 28. Nc3 Kc7 {[#]} 29. a4 $2 {Missing a
tactic again!} ({I expected} 29. Rh1 h6 30. Ne2 {to prepare Kg4 and Nf4. In
reply I saw the classy prophylactic move} Rg8 $5 {Granted, it would have
delighted the connoisseurs of positional play from Nimzowitsch to Dvoretsky,
but all the same it would hardly move Black any closer to obtaining any
advantage.}) 29... h5 $1 30. Ne2 Rg8 {There isn't much mystery in this rook
move. I just wanted a keep some tension.} 31. Rh1 h4 32. Re1 $4 {[#]
Overlooking tactics for the third time sinks White's game.} (32. Rd1 Nc8 {
Perhaps, Black is already a little bit better.}) 32... Nxf5 {This is when I
knew I was going to win this game.} 33. gxf5 Bd2+ 34. Kf1 Bxe1 35. Kxe1 Rg5 $1
{The key move to round up that pawn.} 36. Kf2 Rxf5 37. Ng1 b5 38. axb5 cxb5 39.
Ke3 a4 40. Nh3 b4 {Thre's no hope for the white pieces to deal with two
passers on the opposite ends of the board. There's plenty of practical
examples of that.} 41. Bd1 a3 42. bxa3 bxa3 43. Bb3 Kd6 44. Nf4 Rg5 45. Kf2 Rg8
46. Ba2 (46. Bxd5 Rf8) 46... h3 $1 {The final stroke.} 47. Nxh3 Rb8 0-1
