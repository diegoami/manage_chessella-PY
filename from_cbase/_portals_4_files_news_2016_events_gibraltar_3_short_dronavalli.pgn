1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Be7 {This is a line which has been essayed by Nigel
Short with Black on many occasions.} 4. e5 c5 5. Qg4 Kf8 $5 (5... g6 {weaking
the dark squares is something that Black would like to do.}) 6. dxc5 h5 7. Qe2
Bxc5 8. Nb3 b6 $5 (8... Bb6 {looked more natural but Harika prefers to protect
her bishop. If Niget takes it then bxc5 will give her a good centre.}) 9. Nh3
Qc7 10. Bf4 Ne7 {With knights coming to g6 and c6 the pressure on the e5 pawn
begins to increase.} 11. O-O-O Ng6 12. Kb1 Nc6 13. Re1 a5 $1 {Black's play is
very natural. This prepares to kick the knight with a4 and also go Ba6.} 14.
Nxc5 bxc5 15. Qe3 c4 $6 (15... Qb6 $1 $17 {Would have maintained a solid edge
and asked the knight on h3 what exactly is it doing there.}) 16. Qc5+ {Now
White gets some activity.} Kg8 17. Bc1 a4 18. f4 Nge7 19. Ng5 Nf5 20. Rd1 Ra5
21. Qf2 (21. Qa3 {looks like a precarious location for the white queen but it
stops a4-a3.}) 21... Rb5 22. c3 Qa5 $1 {Attacking the c3 pawn.} 23. Qc2 Rb8 (
23... a3 $5 {was natural. Maybe Harika was afraid of} 24. b4 cxb3 25. axb3 {
But now after} Rc5 $1 {Black holds the advantage as c3 is weak and about to
fall.}) 24. Ka1 Ba6 25. Nf3 Qb5 26. g3 a3 27. bxa3 Qa5 28. Bh3 Bb5 $1 {
Preparing Ba4. Black has an overwhelming iniative and now Nigel cracks.} 29.
Rxd5 $2 {exd5 Bxf5 was playable for White. But now Black has a finishing shot.}
Ba4 $1 30. Qd2 (30. Rxa5 Bxc2 $19 {There is a mate on b1 is the neat point.
Black wins an entire rook.}) 30... Qxd5 31. Qxd5 Bc2 (31... Bc2 $1 32. Bd2 exd5
$19 {And magically the knight on f5 has been defended!}) 0-1
