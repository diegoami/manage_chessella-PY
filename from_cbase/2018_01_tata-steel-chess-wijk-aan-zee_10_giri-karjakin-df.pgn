1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 Bb4+ 4. Nd2 {Maybe similarly to yesterday, Anish Giri
goes for the creation of a slight imbalance. Bd2 is played more often.} c5 {
And Karjakin does not object. In principle, if one plays these ...Bb4 lines,
be they in the Ragozin, Nimzo-Indian, Bogo-Indian or even something else, one
should not object to giving this bishop for a knight and then arranging all
one's pawns on dark squares.} (4... d5 5. Bg2 O-O 6. Ngf3 b6 7. O-O Bb7 {
is another normal way to play this position with Black}) 5. a3 Bxd2+ 6. Qxd2
cxd4 7. Nf3 (7. Qxd4 Nc6 8. Qd3 O-O 9. Bg2 d5 $11) 7... d5 (7... b6 $5 8. Nxd4
Bb7 9. f3 $132 {could lead to some kind of almost Maroczy-like play}) 8. Bg2
dxc4 9. Qxd4 Qxd4 10. Nxd4 O-O {The position is now 'more open than closed'
and so I would probably slightly prefer to be White, but very accurate play is
needed to make anything of this.} 11. Be3 (11. Bg5 $5 e5 12. Nb5 Nc6 13. Rd1
$14 {is maybe one way to go; White will choose soon whether to play with Bxf6,
Nd6 etc or with Be3, h3, Nc3, 0-0 and try and make use of the bishop pair only
once the rooks come off. The Catalan bishop always guarantees at least
sufficient compensation.}) 11... Nd5 12. Rc1 (12. O-O $5 Nxe3 13. fxe3 e5 $11 {
is creative but probably nothing}) 12... c3 $1 (12... Nxe3 13. fxe3 e5 14. Nb5
Nc6 15. Nd6 $14) 13. b3 Nxe3 14. fxe3 Nd7 15. Rxc3 Rd8 16. O-O Nf6 17. Rc7 (17.
Nf3 $5 $14 {is a counter-intuitive machine suggestion that makes a lot of
sense once you look at it a few times, but in any case Black might be able to
neutralise the pressure with the standard bishop-for-knight swap, because the
machine overrates bishops. For instance:} Bd7 18. Ne5 Rac8 19. Rxc8 Rxc8 {
and Black is getting nice and active, whether White accepts the unusual swap
offer or not.}) 17... Rb8 $1 {An ugly but necessary move, and after a few more
similar ones it transpires that White is not better.} 18. Nb5 a5 19. Na7 Bd7
20. Rd1 (20. Rxb7 $2 Rxb7 21. Bxb7 Rb8 $15) 20... b6 {With equality.} 21. Bc6
Bxc6 22. Rxd8+ Rxd8 23. Nxc6 Rd1+ 24. Kg2 h5 25. Ne5 Ng4 (25... Re1 $5 {
might deserve consideration at lower levels, to try and play on based on
White's structure}) 26. Nxg4 $11 {The rook endgame is almost completely equal,
with White's activity counterbalanced by a structural issue.} 1/2-1/2
