1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. f4 Nf6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Bd3 {[#] In the Pirc defence the approach with f2-f4 certainly has a good reputation from the white perspective.} c5 (6... Na6 7. O-O c5 {would have offered an original opportunity to recapture with the knight if necessary on c5, with the advantage that the bishop on d6 could keep tabs on the e5 square.}) 7.
dxc5 Nbd7 {Black sacrifices a pawn and hopes to keep the bishop on e4 tied up.} 8. cxd6 exd6 9. O-O Re8 10. f5 {
[#] White remains true to the spirit of f2-f4 going for an attack which will prove a resounding success!} Nc5 11. fxg6 hxg6 12. Ng5 $1 {[#] The
e4-pawn is covered for the tine being, the f-file is open and Black has to worry seriously about the f7 pawn.} Bg4 ({The engine things} 12... d5 {
is better here, however this is one of those positions where it may not be terribly useful in practice. The wild tactical variations it shows are hard for mere mortals to see...}) 13. Qe1 d5 {Now d5 comes, but the white queen is already on a better square.} 14. e5 (
14. Qh4 {would have been very strong as well.}) 14... d4 {This actually loses relatively easily, after only fourteen moves!} (14... Ncd7 15. Bf4 Nh5 {
looks plausible, but would also be extremely complicated after} 16. Nxf7 {.}) 15. Bc4 $1 {Now White wins material.} Be6 16. Nxe6 Nxe6 17.
