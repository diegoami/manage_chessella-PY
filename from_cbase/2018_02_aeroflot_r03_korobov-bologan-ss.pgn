{Korobov has been in good form of late, so this was a very nice victory for
the Moldovian GM.} 1. d4 d6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 g6 4. g3 Bf5 $5 {Taking the game into
relatively uncharted territory.} 5. Bg2 Qc8 6. Qb3 Bg7 7. Nc3 (7. Nh4 Be4 8. f3
Bxb1 (8... Bc6 9. e4 b6 {is also another way to play. Of course, provocative,
but not bad.}) 9. Rxb1 Nc6 $13 {with an interesting position.}) 7... O-O (7...
Nc6 {Keeping an eye on the d4 pawn and forcing White to play d4-d5 would have
been more in the spirit of the position.}) 8. Nh4 $1 {Now we have a double
attack on the bishop on f5 and the pawn on b7.} Nc6 9. Nxf5 Qxf5 {It seems as
if White should be clearly better. Not only does White have the bishop pair,
the bishop onn b7 is a complete monster. The only thing that Black has going
on for him is the slight lead in development and the attack on the d4 pawn.}
10. e3 (10. Qd1 {was also possible with a slight edge.}) 10... e5 {Bologan's
approach is correct. He plays actively, but Korobov has seen further.} 11. d5
$1 (11. Qxb7 $6 exd4 $1 12. Qxc6 dxc3 13. Qxa8 Rxa8 14. Bxa8 Qd3 $19 {White is
up material, but thoroughly lacks coordination.}) 11... Na5 12. Qa4 b6 13. e4 {
Everything simply comes with a tempo.} Qc8 14. b4 $1 {Korobov is extremely
alert to all the tactical possibilities.} Nb7 (14... Nxc4 15. Qb5 {traps the
knight.}) 15. Qa6 $1 {It is completely clear that Black is struggling.} Nd7 16.
Bd2 f5 17. h4 $6 {This is a pretty overambitious move. White has complete
control on the queenside, so it would have made sense to just castle and claim a
sizeable edge.} (17. O-O $1 Nb8 18. Qa4 a5 19. a3 axb4 20. Qxa8 bxc3 21. Bxc3
Nc5 {Now this position is much different from what actually happens in the
game because 0-0 is much better than the move h4. So White is just better now
after} 22. a4 Nxe4 23. Bxe4 fxe4 24. a5 $18) 17... Nb8 $1 18. Qa4 a5 {Black is
fighting back for squares now.} 19. a3 axb4 $1 {Of course, Bologan is not
going to miss such exchange sacrifices.} 20. Qxa8 bxc3 21. Bxc3 Nc5 {Suddenly
the queen looks misplaced on a8, the king looks weak on e1. This is all a
consequence of the move h4. Korobov wasn't able to shift his approach so
quickly from being better to having to fight to maintain equilibrium.} 22. O-O
Nxe4 23. Bxe4 fxe4 {The queen is now wonderfully placed on c8 to jump to h3!
Black has a pawn for the exchange and also the c5 pawn, so excellent
compensation.} 24. Rae1 $2 {Korobov loses his sense of danger. Allowing the
queen to h3 is just curtains.} (24. Kg2 {or even Kh2 would have been better.})
24... Qh3 25. Rxe4 Nd7 {Developing the knight with a tempo.} 26. Qa4 Rf3 $1 {
Attacking the bishop on c3 and also in future looking at sacrifices on g3.} 27.
Qc2 Nf6 $1 {Everything moves with a tempo!} 28. Bb4 (28. Be1 {This would have
provided added support to the g3 square but after} Bh6 29. Qe2 Ng4 30. Rxg4
Qxg4 {I don't see a way in which White can avoid material losses with e4-e3
coming up.}) 28... Nh5 $1 {The knight need not just take on e4 or go to g4, it
could also sacrifice itself on g3.} 29. Qb1 (29. Be1 Nxg3 30. fxg3 Rxf1#) 29...
Bh6 (29... Nxg3 30. fxg3 Rxg3+ 31. Kf2 Rf3+ 32. Kg1 (32. Ke2 Qg2+ $19) 32...
Qg3+ 33. Kh1 Rb3 $1 {Such moves are not so easy to spot. The main idea is to
deflect the queen from the support of the e4 rook.} 34. Qc1 (34. Qd1 Qh3+ 35.
Kg1 Rg3+ 36. Kf2 Rg2+ 37. Ke1 Qg3+ $19) (34. Qe1 Qh3+ 35. Kg1 Rg3+ 36. Kf2 Rg2#
) 34... Qh3+ 35. Kg1 Rg3+ 36. Kf2 Qg2+ 37. Ke1 Qxe4+ $19) 30. a4 {This is just
an admission of the fact that everything is out of control.} Nf4 $1 31.
Rxf4 (31. gxf4 Qg4+ 32. Kh2 Rh3#) 31... Bxf4 {Now threatening all sorts of
things like Bxg3 or Rxg3. White is just lost and hence Korobov resigned.} (
31... Bxf4 32. Qe1 Bxg3 33. fxg3 Rxg3+ 34. Qxg3 (34. Kf2 Rg2#) 34... Qxg3+ 35.
Kh1 Qxh4+ 36. Kg1 Qxc4 {White loses the entire house!}) 0-1
