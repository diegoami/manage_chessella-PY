1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. e3 e6 5. Nbd2 ({For some reason Caruana
didn't feel like trying to emulate Carlsen's} 5. c4 $5) 5... Bd6 6. Ne5 (6. Bg3
{is the more 'true Londoner' move, but after say} O-O 7. Be2 c5 8. c3 Nc6 $11 {
it is immediately obvious that White has nothing}) 6... h6 7. g4 $5 $146 Bh7 (
7... Bxe5 $5 {is fascinating:} 8. dxe5 Bxg4 9. f3 Nh5 10. fxg4 Nxf4 11. exf4
Qh4+ 12. Ke2 Qxg4+ {but it seems like White probably has an edge with the solid
} 13. Nf3 Qxf4 14. Qd2 $14 {when the piece marginally outperforms the three
pawns.}) 8. h4 Ne4 (8... Nfd7 9. Nxd7 Qxd7 $132 {could eventually leave White
feeling a bit over-extended; for subtle structural reasons Black should
recapture on d6 with the pawn!}) 9. Nxe4 Bxe4 10. f3 Bh7 11. Bd3 (11. Qd2 Nd7
12. O-O-O {might still keep things a bit fresh, as the prospect of a good
bishop versus bad bishop endgame weighs slightly on Black's mind.}) 11... Bxd3
12. Qxd3 Nd7 {Solid and good for equality.} 13. O-O-O Bxe5 $5 (13... Qe7 14. h5
O-O-O $11) 14. dxe5 Qe7 15. e4 dxe4 (15... c6 {could be interesting, keeping
open the option of short castling, but I suspect Black rejected this due to
the possibility of c4 + Qd6 turning out to be a textbook 'incisive
continuation'.}) 16. Qxe4 O-O-O 17. g5 hxg5 18. Bxg5 f6 19. exf6 Nxf6 20. Qe5
Qf7 21. Rhe1 (21. b3 {might improve slightly, not giving away any tempi, and
the cat-and-mouse could continue:} b6 22. Kb2 Rhf8 23. Rxd8+ Rxd8 24. Qe2 $14)
21... Rxd1+ 22. Rxd1 b6 23. b3 Kb8 24. Kb2 Nh7 25. Bf4 (25. f4 $14 {was a
logical human continuation}) 25... Nf6 26. Bg5 Nh7 27. Bf4 Nf6 28. Qd4 Kb7 (
28... Nd5 29. Be5 Qxf3 $11) 29. Be5 Rh5 30. Rg1 Rf5 31. f4 g6 32. Rd1 (32. Qc4
{was an interesting tactical idea, hinting at an overloading of the Black
queen, and then} Nd5 33. Qe4 $36 {could be genuinely unpleasant}) 32... Qe7 33.
Qc3 $6 {This loses the advantage.} Nd5 {Possibly White had thought Qg3 was
good, but missed the tactical idea of ...Nxf4. Black has now equalised again.}
34. Qf3 Kb8 35. Qe4 Qxh4 {Now the most White can do is take on g6, which
implies a trade of pieces, and then there will be nothing left with which to
win.} 36. Rd2 Qe7 37. Rh2 Rf8 38. Rh6 Rg8 39. Rxg6 Rxg6 40. Qxg6 Qd7 41. Qd3
