1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bc5 4. Bg2 c6 5. Nge2 (5. Nf3 {looks a bit
inconsistent, but may be White's best attempt at trying to use every wrinkle
in the position.} d5 6. Nxe5 (6. d3 d4 7. Ne2 Nbd7 8. O-O O-O 9. h3 {is just a
standard King's Indian Attack}) 6... dxe4 7. d3 $5 Bxf2+ 8. Kxf2 Qd4+ 9. Kf1 $5
({After} 9. Be3 Qxe5 10. h3 (10. Bf4 $11 {is just a repetition}) 10... exd3 11.
Qxd3 O-O 12. Rhe1 $44 {White has full compensation for the missing material.})
9... Qxe5 10. Bf4 Qd4 11. Nxe4 O-O $132) 5... d5 6. exd5 cxd5 7. d4 exd4 8.
Nxd4 O-O 9. O-O Bg4 10. Nde2 {A standard-looking move, unleashing some kind of
pressure against the d5-pawn, but here the pawn is free to advance, which was
what White should have tried to avoid.} (10. Qd3 Bxd4 11. Qxd4 Nc6 12. Qc5 d4
13. Ne4 Nxe4 14. Bxe4 Re8 $11 {at least gives White the bishop pair in
exchange for Black's dynamism.}) 10... Qc8 {Perceptively played.} ({After the
immediate} 10... d4 {there is a slight problem with} 11. h3 $1 (11. Na4 Qe8 12.
Nxc5 Bxe2 13. Qe1 Nc6 $44) 11... Bxh3 12. Bxh3 dxc3 13. Qxd8 Rxd8 14. Nxc3 Nc6
15. Bf4 $14 {Here Kramnik would have risked losing the exact same type of game
which he won yesterday.}) 11. Bg5 {On this move and indeed the next few
Adhiban plays extremely well.} (11. Be3 $6 d4 $5 12. Bxd4 Rd8 13. Qd3 Nc6 14.
Bxc6 Qxc6 $11 {is unpleasant for White, but playable if he jumps through a few
more hoops.}) 11... d4 12. Na4 Be7 13. Qd3 h6 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. Nf4 (15. Nxd4
$6 Rd8 16. Qb3 $1 $11 {clings to equality tactically, but this is hard to
calculate.}) 15... Nc6 (15... Nd7 $11 {was marginally more accurate.}) 16. Nd5
Be5 17. Qb5 Bd6 18. Nc5 Bxc5 19. Qxc5 {Suddenly the bishop pair is gone and
Black should think about equality.} Re8 (19... Bh3 {should have been almost an
impulse for a Catalan player like Vladimir Kramnik!}) 20. b4 $14 Kh8 21. Rfe1
Qf5 22. Nc7 Rxe1+ 23. Rxe1 Rd8 (23... Rc8 {prevents White's strong next move
because} 24. Ne8 Qxc5 25. bxc5 Nb4 $132 {gives Black too much play.}) 24. Ne8
$1 (24. Re8+ Rxe8 25. Nxe8 Kg8 26. Nd6 Qxc5 27. bxc5 $14 {is also good for
White, but a bit less convincing}) 24... Qxc5 25. bxc5 Be6 26. Nd6 Rd7 27. a3 {
The first hesitation.} (27. Rb1 Bxa2 28. Rxb7 Rxb7 29. Nxb7 $16 {would have
left Black in a lot of trouble.}) 27... Rc7 28. Nb5 Rc8 29. Nd6 Rc7 30. f4 g6
31. Nb5 {The second hesitation, seemingly looking for another move repetition.}
Rd7 32. Nd6 Na5 {But Kramnik is mentally tough enough to not take it, even
though his position is far from being better.} 33. Rb1 (33. Nxb7 Rxb7 34. Bxb7
Nxb7 35. c6 Nd6 {might have occupied a fair bit of White's time, and while the
position isn't technically winning as such, Black certainly faces more
challenges after} 36. Rd1 $14 {because he will be unable to hold the d-pawn.})
33... Rc7 34. Rb5 b6 $11 {Just like that, the advantage is gone.} 35. Rxa5 $2 {
Imaginative, but not correct.} ({It was a good time for} 35. cxb6 axb6 36. Rb2
Nc4 37. Nxc4 Rxc4 38. Be4 f5 39. Bd3 (39. Rxb6 fxe4 40. Rxe6 e3 $36) 39... Rc6
40. Rb4 Rd6 $11) 35... bxa5 36. c6 a6 {The point is that between this move and
...Re7, Black is able to both discourage Nb5 ideas and hold off the White king.

Nxa5 Rc3 $19 {The front c-pawn being dead, the game is now over. A curious
feature of this tournament, first in variations and now in an actual game,
seems to be nearly-trapped White knights on a5.} 47. Nb3 Rc4 48. Bd3 Rxa4 49.
