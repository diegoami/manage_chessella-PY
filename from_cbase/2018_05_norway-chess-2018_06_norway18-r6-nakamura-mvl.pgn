structure the Carlsen Variation. That should be enough to use this name here too.} g6 (5... Nf6 6. b3 e6

7. Bb2 Nf6 8. 0-0-0 0-0 9. Kb1 {White's argument goes something like this: the knight is not necessarily worse on g1 than on d4,
where it often needs to spend another tempo in the Sicilian to go to e2 or
b3. I prefer to use the two saved tempi for Qxd4 and Qd2, and place my queen in the right square. In addition — and this is why the
Carlsen Variation is so special — I can put my bishop on b2, giving  my king additional protection.} Qa5 10. Nge2 e5 $5 
{a strange move that locks the bishop and
removes it from the game. On the other hand, Nf4 and Nfd5 are prevented, so the knight
on e2 is also bad. In addition, Black can now put the light-squared bishop on e6.} 11. f3 Rd8 ({In case of the immediate} 11... Be6 {

(Vachier-Lagrave), because the black black in some variants is good on f6.
