O-O 9. h3 Ne7 10. Bg5 Ng6 {[#] White didn't achieve much in the opening but is not in bad shape either. A logical move going for a small edge might be Nc2.} 11. Nh4 Kh8 $1 {
Solves the problem of the pinned f-pawn.} 12. Qb3 {This only puts the queen out of play.} Qe8 ({One of my engines already wants to play} 12... Nxh4 13. Bxh4 g5 {Is this possible? Well in any case this line reveals the precariousness of White's position, with her king left nearly devoid of defenders!})
13. Bxf6 gxf6 14. Nf5 ({With} 14. Nxg6+ $1 fxg6 15. Nc2 {White could
close g-line again and still maintain the position.}) 14... Nf4 $1 15. g3 (15. Ng3 {was a better defence but Black would have kept a big edge after} Rg8 16. Bxf7 Be6 17. Qxe6 Qxe6 18. Bxe6 Rxg3 ) 15... Bxf5 {Now Black is winning, but surprisingly the end doesn't come via the g-file after all...} 16. exf5 Qc6 $1 0-1
