1. e4 e6 {One of the funny stories GM Finegold told me was about Judit Polgar.
It seems in 1989 they played a game, in that time there was no Chessbase for
preparing, so she had a printout of a lot of games, and one of the games was
this one. So she couldn't understand how GM Finegold played with Fischer,
because the name of the Player was "Finegold" without showing the first name,
and she imagined he couldn't be alive in 1963...} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 (4.
e5 {Maybe more common nowadays...}) 4... Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 dxe4 6. Qg4 {These
moves are reasonable. One can play them also without knowing opening theory.
The exchange of the dark squares bishop, created a weakness in G7, and of
course the Pe4 is unprotected, so Qg4 attacks them both.} Nf6 7. Qxg7 Rg8 8.
Qh6 Rg6 9. Qe3 b6 {The problem of the French, which is also the reason many
players switch to the Caro-Kann, is how to develop the Bc8, which is boxed-in
by the Pe6. Here Black is trying to develop the Bc8 in A6, or B7.} (9... c5 {
Could be an interesting idea for Black.}) 10. Bb2 Bb7 11. O-O-O {White could
have chosen to develop, one common maneuver is Ng1-e2-f4.} Nbd7 12. h3 {
To prevent Ng4.} Qe7 {Black could try to attack the queenside, since he still
didn't castle. Maybe something like Pa6 and Pb5. GM Lombardy in his book:
"Understanding Chess - My system, My Games, My life." warns of the dangers of
castling too soon, because it can give a clear plan to the opponent, like in
this case.} 13. Ne2 O-O-O 14. c4 {White's dark squares bishop is not so good,
boxed in by pawns, he is like a pawn himself! This is the reason why White
played Pc4, he is trying to activate the Bb2.} e5 $6 {Black misunderstand the
needs of the position. White has the bishop pair, which today, as well as in
1963, was considered an advantage, it can be an advantage ONLY if the position
opens. If it is closed the knights are better. Pe5 helps White to open the
position, and activate the Bb2. From what GM Finegold said, it seems someone
told his dad Fischer wasn't good in the endgame, before the game, so Black
following such advice is trying to exchange the pieces, and reach the endgame,
in order to draw.} 15. dxe5 Nxe5 16. Rxd8+ Kxd8 17. Nf4 {Pay attention to the
importance of this move. White needs to finish the development, but how to
develop the Bf1, when that piece is protecting the Pg2 which is attacked by
the Rg6? Nf4 is the answer!} Rg8 18. Be2 Kc8 19. Rd1 Rd8 20. Rxd8+ Kxd8 {
Exchanging all the rooks wasn't a good idea if we evaluate the value of the
pieces. For example now the Bb2 is very strong, controls lots of squares.
Could someone imagine such bright future for a bishop when was developed at
move 10?} 21. Qg3 Ng6 22. h4 {White doesn't play Nxg6, because he wants to
keep the Ph7 alone and isolated.} Nxf4 23. Qxf4 Ne8 24. h5 (24. Bh5 {Notice
how when the position opens, one needs to use the bishops to attack.} f6 {
Now Black has a problem. The Ne8 needs to be there to protect the Pf6,
otherwise White could play Bxf6, and the game is over. While White is free to
create more problems, till the moment Black makes a decisive mistake.} 25. c5
$16 {This move would damage Black's pawn structure, while getting rid of a
doubled pawn.}) 24... Bc8 25. h6 $6 $11 {White wants to fix Black's pawns on
squares he can attack, thanks to his bishop pair. But the problem is: White
doesn't have enough tempi to make it happen!} Qd6 $6 $14 (25... f5 $1 {This
move supports the Pe4, and blocks White. Now Bh5 doesn't have the same
strength it had before.}) 26. Qg5+ Qe7 27. Qd5+ Qd6 $2 (27... Bd7 28. Qa8+ Bc8
29. Kb1 (29. Qxa7 $4 Qc5 30. Qa8 (30. f3 $4 Qe3+ 31. Kd1 (31. Kb1 Qxe2 $19)
31... Qg1+ 32. Kd2 e3+ 33. Kd3 Bf5+ 34. Kd4 Qf2 35. Ke5 Qxe2 36. Kxf5 Qxc2+ {
game over...}) 30... Qxf2 $17) 29... Qe6 30. Bc1 Qe5 31. Qd5+ Qxd5 32. cxd5 $16
) 28. Qg5+ (28. Be5 $5 Qxd5 29. cxd5 Bf5 30. Kd2 $16) 28... Qe7 29. Qg3 $6 $11
Bf5 30. Qf4 Qe6 $6 $14 (30... Bg6 $5 {Maybe this was better, than the move
played in the game.}) (30... Qc5 {This is another move worth considering.} 31.
g4 (31. Qg5+ Kd7 32. g4 Be6 33. Qxc5 bxc5 34. Kd2 $11) 31... Bg6 $11) 31. g4
Bg6 32. Qg5+ Qe7 33. Qd5+ Qd6 $2 $16 {For GM Finegold this is the losing move.
GM Finegold rationale is based upon the evaluation of pawn structures and
piece activity. Here GM Finegold says White needs to ask himself: What should
he do in order to eliminate the doubled pawn on the C file?  Answering that
question leads to an improved pawn structure.} (33... Qd7 {For GM Finegold
this was the right move to play.} 34. Qa8+ Ke7 35. c5 $11 (35. Qxa7 $2 $17 Qd6
36. Qa4 Qf4+ 37. Kd1 Qxf2 $17)) 34. Be5 Qxd5 35. cxd5 {One can notice how
White's bishop pair became more powerful, and active with all these lines open.
Compare it to Black's piece activity. Let's not mention the possible
difference in King's activity. White king can travel all around the board...}
f6 36. Bg3 Ke7 $2 37. Kd2 Nd6 38. Ke3 b5 {Black missed White next move out of
the dogmatic idea that the Bishop pair is an advantage. I've noticed in many
Fischer's games he gets rid of the bishop pair, if it helps him enter a
position he considers a won endgame, also if such won endgame is not clear to
many.} 39. Bxd6+ Kxd6 40. Kd4 {Now the endgame is quite instructive, and GM
Finegold says it has been used in many books and magazines. It would be good
for the amateur to play it from Fischer's side against an engine and see if he
can win.} a6 41. c4 bxc4 42. Bxc4 a5 43. Ba2 {A waiting move which obliges
Black to move!} f5 44. gxf5 Bxf5 45. Bb3 Bg6 46. Ba4 Bf5 47. Be8 Ke7 48. Ke5
Bg4 49. Bg6 {Now the game is over. GM Finegold told another interesting story
relative to this tournament. This is the famous tournament in which Fischer
fell asleep against Bisguier.  Bisguier woke him up, and obviously lost the
game. Many think Blitz is bad for chess, well the reason Fischer fell asleep
was that he played blitz all night long!} Bd7 50. Bxh7 c6 51. dxc6 Bxc6 52.
