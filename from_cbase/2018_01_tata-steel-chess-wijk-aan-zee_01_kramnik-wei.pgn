1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. d4 Nf6 5. O-O O-O 6. c4 dxc4 7. Na3 {A good
move to play for a long technical battle!} c5 8. dxc5 c3 {The approved method
of gaining equality, but I think Black might have to take the pawn on the next
move to prove it.} (8... Qxd1 {was tried recently, but it is more unpleasant
for Black.} 9. Rxd1 Nfd7 10. Nxc4 Nxc5 11. Be3 $16 {Meier,G-Edouard,R Germany
2017}) 9. Nb5 $1 Na6 (9... cxb2 10. Bxb2 Bd7 11. Qb3 Bc6 12. Rfd1 {was a
previous Kramnik game: Kramnik,V-Topalov,V London 2016; here I think ...Qa5
and then ...Nbd7 offers Black reasonable play.}) 10. Nxc3 Nxc5 11. Be3 Nfe4 12.
Nxe4 Nxe4 13. Bd4 Bxd4 14. Qxd4 Qxd4 15. Nxd4 Nd6 {Unbelievably, this had all
been seen before, and from Wei Yi's next move, it is clear that he had seen
the precedent.} 16. Rac1 (16. Rfc1 Rd8 17. Rc7 Kf8 18. Rac1 Ne8 19. R7c4 Nd6
20. Rc5 Bd7 $11 {was equal and ultimately drawn in Ding,L-Giri,A Palma de
Mallorca 2017}) 16... Rd8 (16... e5 17. Nb3 Be6 {was now worthy of note, and
while I might think it's an equalising route, we will just have to wait for
Kramnik to beat another elite player to find out what he had in mind here!})
17. f4 {This approach goes better with the rook on f1 than a1, as White wants
to bring it to d1 next.} Kf8 18. Kf2 Bg4 19. h3 Bd7 20. e4 (20. Rc7 $5 {
appeals to me, as I think the e4-e5 push gains in strength from there being no
rooks on the board.}) 20... Rac8 (20... Nb5 $1 {was still objectively equal if
a little unpleasant over the board:} 21. Nxb5 (21. Rfd1 Nxd4 22. Rxd4 Be6 $15)
21... Bxb5 22. Rfd1 Rxd1 23. Rxd1 Rc8 24. Rd2 f6 $11) 21. Rxc8 (21. e5 {
may have been good, taking advantage of a moment when Black is not able to
reply with ...Nb5 and must worry about the b7-pawn.} Nf5 22. Ne2 Bb5 $1 {
This accurate move may be needed to hold the balance. There could follow} 23.
Rxc8 Rxc8 24. Rc1 Rxc1 25. Nxc1 b6 26. Be4 {and Black should just be equal
with one or two more good moves.}) 21... Rxc8 22. Rd1 {The point seems to be
that after ...Nb5 White now intends Ne2!, a4, and Nc3.} Ke8 23. e5 Nf5 24. Nb3
Bc6 (24... Rc2+ 25. Rd2 Rxd2+ 26. Nxd2 b6 {would have led to a similar ending
to the last note.}) 25. Rc1 {Now I think White has a little something!} Kd7 26.
Nc5+ Ke8 27. Nd3 (27. Na6 $5 {is rather flashy for a move that is only trying
to inflict pawn weaknesses on the opponent, but Black seems to be fine after
the accurate} Nd4 $1 $11) 27... Kd7 28. g4 {Giving Black a major headache- his
best move now requires a wrinkle to make it playable.} Nd4 (28... Bxg2 29. e6+
fxe6 30. Ne5+ Kd8 31. Nf7+ Kd7 32. Rxc8 Kxc8 33. Kxg2 Nd6 34. Ng5 {looks
slightly unpleasant for Black, though the machine notes that he draws with the
only move} e5 $1 35. fxe5 h6 $1 $11) 29. Rc4 Ne6 30. f5 gxf5 31. gxf5 Ng7 (
31... Nd8 $14 {limited the damage by not allowing another isolated pawn,
though the co-ordination and space deficits are still there.}) 32. Bxc6+ bxc6 (

Rxa7 $18) 35. f6 {Winning a pawn by force.} exf6 36. exf6 Ne8 37. Rxh5 Nxf6 38.
Rf5 Nd5 39. Rxf7+ Kd6 40. Ne4+ Ke5 41. Nd2 a5 {Black has played well these
last ten moves, keeping active even at the cost of a pawn, but unfortunately
White's position is probably winning with best play.} 42. Nc4+ Ke6 43. Rh7 Rb8
44. Ke2 Kf5 45. Rh6 Nf6 46. h4 a4 47. Kd3 c5 (47... Rd8+ $16 {would have
continued to put up more active resistance}) 48. Ne3+ Ke5 49. h5 $6 (49. Rg6 $1
$18 {forces Black's king back for tactical reasons. The position can't be held
anymore.}) 49... Rd8+ {In the game again! I suspect there was an element of
time pressure here.} 50. Kc4 $6 Ne4 $4 (50... Rd2 $1 $11 {is a sudden draw;
the subtlety here is that while Black can't take on b2 immediately, he does
have} 51. Kxc5 Ne4+ 52. Kc6 Kd4 $1 53. Nf5+ Ke5 {The knight has no good way to
avoid the attention of the Black king, and Rxb2 is always on the cards.}) 51.
Kb5 {Now White picks up the a-pawn and there should be no further drama.} Kd4
52. Nc4 $18 a3 53. Nxa3 Nd6+ 54. Kc6 Nf7 55. Nb5+ 1-0
