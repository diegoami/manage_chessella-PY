1. e4 c5 ({Surprise number one, as Gledura usually plays} 1... e5) 2. Nf3 e6 3. c3
{Surpirse number two, as Nils used to play consistent main lines earlier in his
career. It seems he has adopted to a world where one is trying, mostly, to get
to out of the book, or at least out of the opponent's preparation. Since
Black's first move indicates a preparation, Nils steps out of his usual ways.}
Nf6 4. e5 Nd5 5. Bc4 b6 {The next surprise and a very rare move. It seems that
Gledura is following in the footsteps of his compatriot Richard Rapport, in
steering towards (very) unclear and somewhat dubious territory.} ({The main
lines are reached with} 5... d6) ({or} 5... Nb6 6. Bb3 d6) 6. d4 Bb7 7. O-O Be7
({Instinctively I would evaluate} 7... cxd4 8. cxd4 Be7 {as more proper, but
Gledura's choice leads to a higher complexity.}) 8. dxc5 $1 {Nils picks up the
gauntlet. If White plays anything else, Black "got away" with not taking on d4.
} bxc5 9. Nbd2 ({The engines prefer} 9. Na3 O-O 10. Bd3 {, but eventually
comes to the realization that} d6 11. Nc4 dxe5 12. Nfxe5 Nd7 {gives Black good
dynamic play for a small price (slightly worse pawn structure).}) 9... O-O 10.
Ne4 f5 $6 (10... Qc7 11. Re1 Nc6 12. Bg5 $1 (12. Bd3 c4 13. Bc2 Rad8 $132)
12... f6 (12... Bxg5 $6 13. Nexg5 Nf4 14. Qc2 $36) 13. exf6 Nxf6 14. Bd3 {
leads to a balanced position, where White has a slight structural advantage in
that it is hard for Black to arrange the central pawns in such a way that none
is left behind. On the bonus side Black has active pieces and nice play on the
f-file.}) 11. Nd6 $5 ({Both players carry out the most ambitious ideas again
and again. Here} 11. exf6 Nxf6 12. Nxf6+ Rxf6 13. Ne5 d5 14. Bd3 Nd7 15. Ng4 {
would have led to some advantage for White.}) 11... Bxd6 12. exd6 Qf6 ({
In the analysis room Yassir Seirawan and Ferdinand Hellers started looking into
} 12... Qb6 {almost immediately and it was also my first choice. The point is
that; since the d6-pawn is under threat, White's forces are unable to
immediately reach their optimal squares (Ne5, Re1, Bf1), so that Black gets
time to develop the knight. In the mean time the c5-pawn is also properly
protected.} 13. Qb3 (13. Bb3 {was suggested by the commentators, Hellers and
Seirawan, and it is one of the best moves:} Rc8 14. Ne5 Qxd6 15. Re1 Qc7 16.
Bg5 $44) (13. Be2 {was my instinctiv "first choice", but Black is doing fine
here after} a5 {, followed by Nc6 and Ba6. I would even rather play the black
side here.}) 13... Nf6 14. Ne5 Bd5 15. Bxd5 exd5 16. Bf4 {looks like the best
try for White, but Black has a few decent defences. One is} Nc6 17. Rfe1 Nxe5
18. Bxe5 Qxb3 19. axb3 Kf7 {which is about equal.}) 13. Re1 $1 {Keeping an eye
on e5, while allowing the bishop on c4 to retreat all the way back to f1. The
latter is quite important as - which is a usual case when knights play against
bishops - the bishop is out of the way and cannot be further attacked by a
knight. Nor does it obstruct the rook on the e-file, or end up in limbo on b3.}
Nb6 14. Bf1 ({Ferdinand Hellers suggested} 14. Bb5 $5 {which is a move
designed to create some disarray in Black's position. After} a6 $6 15. Bf1 {
Black has to look out for Qd1-b3}) (14. Be2 {is the engine's first choice,
mainly since it turns Bxf3 into a bad move. Still I doubt it is any better
than Bf1.}) 14... f4 $5 {This blocks Bc1 out of the game and is the only
ambitious move that isn't hopeless. The other (not ambitious) alternative is} (
14... Bxf3 $1 15. Qxf3 Nc6 {, when White can win a pawn with} 16. Be3 c4 17.
Bxb6 axb6 18. Bxc4 Ne5 19. Qe2 Nxc4 20. Qxc4 {. However, after} Rfc8 {the
position is quite hard for White to win due to Black's active pieces. An
important point is that the d6-pawn is an asset for White when there are many
minor pieces on the board, but in this situation it is more of a liability. If
the queens come off, it can be attacked with e5, Kg8-f7-e6/Rc6 and before that
it keeps d7 from coming under long distance scrutiny.}) 15. a4 $1 {An
excellent move that the commentators also came up with. The point is that both
bishop and knight need the d5-square, but only one of them can stay there. The
downside is that it becomes less attractive for White to play c4 later, since
this would give Black access to the d4-square.} Bd5 $2 {This move is far too
slow and is Black's reaction to ending up in a position that he is not
comfortable with. He would like to play Bd5 before Nc6, but it is a fantasy to
be able to do both. Black is behind in development and has to deal with a very
insidious pawn on d6, but there is no way to deal with all the problems with
one move. So, catching up in development should be the first priority.} (15...
Bxf3 {is necessary and after} 16. Qxf3 Nc6 {White, at least, has to worry
about the passive position of the bishop on c1. One possible continuation
would be} 17. a5 Nd5 18. Ra4 Rab8 19. Bd3 {when, objectively, White is much
better, but Black is not without chances.}) 16. a5 $1 {Now Black's pieces all
end up in disarray.} Nc8 (16... Nc4 17. Ra4 $1 Nxd6 18. Rxf4 $18) 17. Ra4 g5
18. Ne5 $6 (18. h4 $1 {is stronger and would have finished the game quickly:}
h6 19. hxg5 hxg5 20. Ne5 Qg7 21. c4 Bc6 22. Ra3 Rf5 23. Ng4 {followed by Rh3,
is game over. However, perhaps Nils saw the line in the game and didn't find a
reason to look for a better one.}) 18... Qg7 {Making way for the rook to
question the strong knight on e5.} (18... Nxd6 $2 19. c4 Bc6 20. Nxc6 Nxc6 21.
Qxd6 $18) 19. c4 $6 {Now it becomes complicated again.} (19. h4 $1 Rf5 20. Bd3
Rxe5 21. Rxe5 Qxe5 22. Qh5 Nxd6 23. Bxf4 {wins by force, but I understand the
attraction of keeping things simple.}) 19... Bc6 20. Ra3 ({I was curious about
} 20. Bd2 $5 Bxa4 21. Qxa4 Nxd6 22. Bc3 {during the game, and it seems to be
quite strong too. The best defence according to the silicon monster is} Qe7 23.
Bd3 Nc6 24. Nxc6 dxc6 25. Qxc6 Rad8 26. Qxc5 Nf5 {, but} 27. Qxe7 Nxe7 28. Be2
Nc6 29. Bg4 e5 30. Bf3 {leaves Black in a terrible pickle. No reason to take
such chances though.}) ({Another version of the Bd2-c3-idea is} 20. b3 $1 {
, which allows White to hang on to the d6-pawn a while longer. After} Bxa4 21.
bxa4 Rf5 22. Bb2 Nc6 23. Nxc6 Qxb2 24. Rxe6 $3 Rf8 25. Re2 Qg7 26. Qd5+ Kh8 27.
Ne5 Rb8 28. Qxc5 Rb1 29. Qd4 {Black is playing without the knight on c8, so
White is basically playing with two minor pieces against a rook.}) 20... Rf5 $1
21. Ng4 h5 22. Bd3 $1 Nxd6 (22... hxg4 23. Bxf5 exf5 24. Re8+ Kf7 25. Rxc8 Na6
26. Rxa8 Bxa8 {at first looks like some kind of compensation for Black, due to
the lack of squares for the bishop and rook. However} 27. h3 $1 {is winning
for White, since} gxh3 28. Qh5+ Qg6 29. Rxh3 {opens up for the rook to enter
on the h-file.}) 23. Bxf5 Nxf5 24. Ne5 h4 $6 {If only Black's knight wasn't on
b8, this might be called "compensation for the exchange". It is on b8 though.}
({Here} 24... d6 $1 25. Nxc6 Nxc6 26. Rxe6 (26. Qxh5 $2 Ncd4 $13) 26... Ncd4
27. Re1 Qf7 {looks like a better chance to survive a bit longer, but after} 28.
b4 $1 {the end result is not in question.}) 25. Rd3 Nd4 26. b4 $1 d6 27. Ng4
Nd7 {White can take on d4 any time now, but Nils prefers to kick the bishop
back first.} 28. b5 Bb7 29. a6 Bc8 30. Rxd4 $1 cxd4 31. Rxe6 Ne5 32. Nf6+ Kf7
33. Rxd6 Be6 34. Ne4 Nxc4 35. Rxd4 {Now Nxg5+ and Nc5 are threatened.} Rc8 {
This stops Nc5, but allows} 36. Rd7+ {Black resigned.} 1-0
