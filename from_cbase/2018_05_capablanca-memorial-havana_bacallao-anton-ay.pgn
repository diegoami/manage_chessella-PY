Qd3 {Aronian's idea, first tried against Ding Liren in the final match of the
World Cup 2017.} Nc6 9. Nxd7 Nxd7 {That's the point of White's unusual queen
move. In order to avoid an unpleasant endgame, Black has to recapture with the
knight.} 10. Nc3 Be7 11. Qb5 h5 $5 {[#] An interesting novelty.} ({
Aronian-Sethuraman, Gibraltar 2018 saw} 11... a6 12. Qa4 Nd4 {and a convincing
victory for the Armenian Super GM}) 12. d3 {Bacallao decides to keeps his best
piece, the light-squared bishop.} ({The position after} 12. Bxc6 bxc6 13. Qc4
Nb6 14. Qe4 f5 15. Qc2 h4 {features Black's multiple pawn weaknesses
compensated by active pieces.}) 12... Nd4 {I'm not sure this move was
necessary.} 13. Qa4 h4 14. O-O h3 15. Bh1 O-O 16. Be3 {The Cuban GM wants to
play it safe.} ({He had a chance to drive that knight away with} 16. e3 Nf5 {
followed by the accurate move} 17. Rd1 $1 {which should be enough for White's
advantage.} ({less effective is} 17. Qg4 Ne5 18. Qe2 Qd7 19. Rd1 Rad8)) 16...
Nb6 17. Qd1 Qd7 18. a4 a5 19. b3 f5 20. Bd2 Rfd8 {This seems a bit
inconsistent with pushing the f-pawn forward, but David must have been
concerned with the defense of his a5-pawn.} ({Yet,} 20... Rad8 $5 21. Nb5 Nd5
22. Bxa5 b6 23. Nxd4 cxd4 24. Bd2 Nc3 {looks possible.}) 21. Rc1 g6 22. Re1 {
[#]} Kh7 {Black's main problem is a terribly placed Nb6.} ({However, an
attempt to bring it back into play,} 22... Nd5 {has a downside of allowing
White to close the d-file, as in} 23. Nxd5 exd5 24. e3 Nc6 25. Qe2 {where the
queen is after the overextended h-pawn.} b6 26. Qf1) 23. e4 $1 {What a nice
idea!} Bf8 (23... Nc6 24. exf5 exf5 25. Nb5 {leaves Black's position exposed.
It's unlikely he'll ever be able to capture the d3-pawn}) 24. Bg5 Re8 25. Re3
$6 ({The piece that holds Black's position together is his great Nd4.
Therefore,} 25. Ne2 {looked the most logical continuation.}) 25... Bh6 26. Bxh6
Kxh6 27. Ne2 ({I guess, the original plan called for} 27. Qf1 {but that would
entail losing the b3-pawn}) 27... Qd6 28. Nxd4 cxd4 29. Re1 Nd7 30. Rc2 $2 {
Tentative again.} ({I don't see much wrong with} 30. exf5 exf5 31. Bxb7) 30...
Kg7 31. Rce2 f4 $1 {[#] It almost looked like White's previous play was
designed to force this pawn push, but how can it be bad for Black?} 32. e5 Qb4
33. Qc1 {Bacallao is drifting.} (33. gxf4 Rf8 34. Be4 Rxf4 35. Kh1 Raf8 36. Rg1
Nxe5 37. Qf1 {had to be the better option. I suppose some time trouble was
present, and in such situations it's better to follow a plan, even a bad one.})
33... Rf8 34. Rc2 (34. Qc4 Nc5 35. Qxb4 axb4 $17) 34... Rac8 $1 {This nice
shot signals the end of White's counterplay.} 35. Rc4 Rxc4 36. bxc4 Nc5 37. Be4
