1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {Cramling doesn't care
for modern fashion, she plays what she knows best - always a sound strategy in
blitz,} 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qd3 Be7 8. O-O-O O-O 9. f4 h6 10. Bh4 Nxd4 11. Qxd4 Qa5
12. Bc4 Qh5 {This odd move has been given some attention in recent practice.}
13. Bg3 Rd8 14. Kb1 (14. Rhe1 Bd7 15. f5 {appears to be a critical
continuation.}) 14... Bd7 {[#]} 15. e5 $2 {This is connected to an oversight
that will be highlighted in the next note.} dxe5 16. fxe5 Bc6 17. Qf4 Rxd1+ 18.
Rxd1 Nd5 19. Bxd5 Bxd5 {Black is already doing well, thanks to her Qh5 that
keeps an eye on d1, thus delying White a possibility of Nxd5.} 20. Qf1 Bc6 21.

Qd4 {[#] Black is doing great, no doubt, but Pia finds the right path, which
would stay hidden for less experienced players.} Ba5 $1 {A decision on the
level of chess understanding of World Rapid Champion Vishy Anand, who
showcased similar ideas in his games against Leko and Grischuk in Riyadh.} 35.
Qa4 Bxc3+ 36. Kxc3 Bd5 {What clarity of chess vision! Black traded away her
bishop pair advantage to remove the white king's most faithful defender. The
situation is stable now, and Pia can easily make further threats.} 37. Kb2 Qc4
$1 {It's essentual to correctly judge possibly simplifications.} 38. Qa5 (38.
Qxc4 Bxc4 39. b6 Kg6 40. Kc3 Bd5 41. Kd4 Kf5 {No trace of counterplay for

{[#] A standard Kings Indian situation now, and look what's coming next.} 25.
Bxc5 $3 {yep, that trade again.} dxc5 26. Ne3 {While objectively weaker this
move shows that Cramling's idea was more of a long-term solution than odd
tactical chance.} (26. Qh6 {was possible right away.}) 26... Nb5 27. Nc4 Rb8 $2
