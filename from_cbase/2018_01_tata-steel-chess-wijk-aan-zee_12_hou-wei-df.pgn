1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 (5. c4 Nc6 {can, as we now
know, lead to a quick repetition of moves...}) 5... Nxc3 (5... Nf6 $5 {was
weakly recommended in my analysis to the first round- White needs to get an
idea or two and then he is better.}) 6. dxc3 Be7 7. Be3 {Interestingly, this
is the same system chosen against Hou Yifan herself by Anish Giri.} Nc6 8. Qd2
{Trying to make do without Anish's Bd3 and head directly for Bb5xc6 to inflict
on her opponent the structure that caused her so much trouble back in round 1!}

g4 h6 15. Nd2 $1 $14 {Now White is probably a tiny bit better in practical
terms, but obviously an incredible amount of technique is needed before White
can think about winning. Nevertheless he did in Giri,A-Hou,Y, Tata Steel
Masters 2018.}) 8... Be6 9. O-O-O Bf6 (9... O-O {is not a bad move, but Black
will need a plan for dealing with the slow kingside attack from White:} 10. Bd3
Qd7 11. h4 Rad8 $6 12. Ng5 Bf5 13. g4 $40) (9... Qd7 {was the main move, and
in fact this was used in a previous Wei Yi game- I wonder what the problem was?
}) 10. Kb1 Qd7 11. Bg5 {Pointing out a problem with the moves ...Bf6 and ...
Qd7 in conjunction (...Qe7 would not have had this problem, but it would have
made Nd4 look more convincing, so perhaps the issue lies with ...Bf6.)} (11.
Ng5 Bxg5 12. Bxg5 f6 13. Bf4 O-O-O $11 {is the stereotyped continuation from
both sides, when White is well advised to not develop her f1-bishop quickly,
or else it will simply be harrassed.}) (11. h4 O-O-O 12. Nd4 Bxd4 $5 13. cxd4
d5 {led in Li,C-Wei,Y China 2017 to the kind of position that the present
event is making me re-evaluate as closer to 'equal' than '+/='.}) 11... Bxg5
12. Nxg5 O-O-O 13. Nxe6 Qxe6 14. Bb5 Qf5 15. Bxc6 bxc6 {Mission accomplished,
kind of. White is now slightly better by virtue of pawn-islands, and it looks
very likely that we will reach a queen ending again!} 16. Rhe1 Rhe8 17. f3 c5
18. b3 $14 Kb7 19. Re2 (19. Kb2 $5) 19... Re6 20. Rxe6 fxe6 21. Re1 e5 {
Reaching a position which is similar in essence to Jones-Hou, except White is
not a pawn down here.} 22. Qd5+ c6 23. Qd2 Kc7 24. Re4 Qd7 25. f4 {In
principle a good break to have made, but maybe White should have concentrated
a bit more on the front she had open first.} (25. Qd3 $14 {kept probing.})
25... exf4 26. Qe2 Qf5 27. Ra4 Kb8 28. Qa6 Qd7 29. Rxf4 Re8 30. Kb2 h6 31. Qd3
(31. h4 {was a good idea- none of Black's pieces has much mobility and White
can try and arrange b4!? at a good time- or else just push kingside pawns
until Black feels he has to do something.}) 31... Kb7 32. h4 Re6 33. Rf8 Re7
34. g4 (34. Qg3 {keeps Black more tied down}) 34... d5 35. g5 $6 {Now Black
equalises with} hxg5 36. hxg5 Rf7 $11 {since the position is a little bit too
open. Black can try to get counterplay based on the f-file and diagonals a1-h8/
b1-h7 as indeed he proceeds to do.} 37. Rg8 Re7 38. Rf8 Rf7 39. Rh8 Qd6 40. Qh3
d4 41. Re8 (41. Qc8+ Kb6 42. Qb8+ Qxb8 43. Rxb8+ Kc7 44. Rg8 {might offer some
small chances}) 41... Rf2 {Brave play- Black has calculated all the necessary
checks and attacking moves from White. Now the ideas like ...d3 and ...Rxc2
force White to take real evasive action.} 42. Qd3 Rg2 43. cxd4 Qxd4+ 44. Qxd4
