{After my debacle in round 2 where I struggled badly against the tournament's
bottom seed but somehow managed to survive with a draw, this was a really
critical game for me if I want to preserve reasonable chances of making a GM
norm. My confidence was pretty low but I badly wanted a win as I knew that
would bring me back on track.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 Be7 {
This came as a surprise. Fortunately, I had spent a fair bit of time in this
variation that I knew reasonably what to do.} ({These days, the Italian game
starting with} 4... Bc5 {is by far the more popular approach, and Jingyao's
main opening weapon.}) 5. O-O O-O 6. Re1 {This prevents Black from playing the
liberating ...d5 move.} (6. Bb3 {with the idea of c3 and rerouting the queen's
knight to the f1 square with Nbd2, Re1 and Nf1 is the traditional plan.}) 6...
d6 7. a4 {An important prophalactic move, preserving White's important square
bishop as it addresses the threat of ...Na5. As we will see, one of the most
complex structures generally in the Italian arises after Black goes ...Be6 and
recaptures on the bishop with ...fe6. While the engine always likes White, it
can be difficult to cope with Black's practical chances on the kingside and I
find myself getting mated many times during my own analysis.} (7. a3 {seems to
be a popular move these days}) 7... Na5 {This is the most popular move on my
database but Black can choose from many different set-ups. During the game, I
was quite happy to see this move as the typical middlegames arising from this
set-up are risk-free for White.} ({For example, Black can start with} 7... Be6
8. Nbd2 ({The doubled e-pawn structure seems to work well with Black's room on
f8:} 8. Bxe6 fxe6 9. c3 Qe8 {and Black will start to bring his pieces over to
the queenside.})) 8. Ba2 c5 9. c3 Nc6 10. Na3 h6 11. Bd2 Re8 {I thought that
this was a preparatory move for ...Bf8 and ...Be6, following by recapturing
with the rook. I am slightly relieved that Jingyao was not trying to mate me
on the kingside!} ({In general, White wants to meet ...Be6 with Bxe6 followed
by Nc4. The knights on c4 and f3 dominate the centre and prevent Black from
breaking with ...d5 easily. As such, it makes sense for Black to find a useful
move and see if White would move his a3 knight away before committing ...Be6.
In that respect,} 11... a6 $5 {speaks for itself. I was ready to play} 12. h3 (
12. Nc2 Be6 13. Bxe6 fxe6 {helps Black as we already discussed.}) 12... Rb8 13.
Nc4 Be6 14. b4 cxb4 15. cxb4 b5 16. axb5 axb5 17. Na5 $14 {as played in the
model game Vocaturo,D (2606)-Satyapragyan,S (2462) Sitges 2016}) 12. Nc2 Be6 $2
{This was an important strategic error after which White gets an easy
advantage by force.} (12... Bf8 {was by far more consistent but I would still
like my chances of getting an edge after} 13. Ne3) 13. Bxe6 fxe6 14. b4 ({
I was choosing between the game continuation and the central break with} 14. d4
{but I did not like} exd4 15. cxd4 d5 $5 {which messes up the game somewhat.})
14... cxb4 15. cxb4 Qd7 $2 {This was another strange decision from my opponent.
Manoeuvring the knight to d8 and then to f7 hardly improves its prospect.} (
15... Rc8 {was much more natural although White is still better after} 16. Qb1
$5 {with the idea of playing Qb3 and Rad1.}) 16. b5 Nd8 17. Na3 $1 {A nice
manoeuvre to bring the knight back to where it belongs. It is important not to
commit to any changes in this pawn structure before White's piece placements
are optimised.} Nf7 18. Nc4 Nh7 {Black's idea is clearly to exchange pieces in
view of his lack of space.} 19. Bc3 (19. h4 {was possible but I did not like}
Nf6 {and suddenly Black has the g4 square at his disposal. Hence, I wanted to
wait and see if Black would play something like ...Bf6 before pushing Harry.
That will slow Black down if he wants to bring a knight to the g4 square after
I had played h4.}) 19... Nhg5 20. Nfd2 $1 Bf6 {Bingo!} 21. h4 Nh7 22. Nf3 Rac8
23. g3 $1 {A nice restraining move, and not committing anything yet to the
placement of my queen and the a1 rook.} g6 $2 {Jingyao was in poor form for
this game but to be fair, he had to handle a very difficult position where he
is extremely cramped and lacks active plans.} ({The tactical point is that} 
23... d5 {does not work due to} 24. Ncxe5 Qc7 25. Rc1 $18 {and White defends
the e5 knight tactically.}) ({I was considering} 23... Bd8 {, with the idea of
...Nf6 but perhaps Jingyao did not want to keep moving his pieces up and down.
Here, I was probably going to play} 24. Kg2 {followed by some random rook move.
White can pleasantly take his time in choosing a good plan.}) 24. Qd2 $2 {
This allowed unnecessary counterplay.} (24. Bb2 {, getting out of any tactical
mess on the c-file was safer.}) 24... Bg7 $2 (24... d5 25. exd5 $1 exd5 26.
Ncxe5 $18) (24... g5 $1 {would have create some kind of a mess on the kingside:
} 25. hxg5 Nhxg5 26. Nxg5 Nxg5 27. Qe2 Bg7 {followed by Rf8. White can
probably defend this easily but there was no need to even allow a single shred
of counterplay.}) 25. Qe3 $1 {Poking at the queenside. Now, I was sure Black
would not defend passively with ...Ra8 with leaves only 1 plausible reply.} b6
26. a5 $1 {At this moment, I was already feeling confident of breaking through
successfully.} Qxb5 $6 (26... Rb8 27. axb6 axb6 28. Nxb6 Qxb5 29. Rab1 Qc6 30.
Rec1 $16 {was the lesser evil.}) 27. axb6 $2 {I had thought this would win
immediately but Black in fact had a miraculous defence in hand....} (27. Reb1
$1 Qc5 28. Qxc5 Rxc5 29. axb6 axb6 30. Rxb6 d5 31. Ra7 $1 dxc4 32. Rbb7 $1 Rf8
33. Bb4 {was a convincing finish that I had missed.}) 27... d5 $2 {A tactical
oversight after which White wins pretty much by force} ({I had calculated} 
27... axb6 $1 28. Reb1 (28. Ra7 $1 {apparently keeps an edge.}) 28... Qc5 29.
Qxc5 bxc5 30. Rb7 Rf8 (30... Ra8 31. Rxf7) 31. Raa7 {but had missed that after
the stunning} Ra8 $3 {,} 32. Rxf7 {was not winning in view of the hanging f3
knight!}) 28. b7 (28. Reb1 Qc6 29. b7 Rb8 30. Bxe5 dxc4 31. Bxb8 Rxb8 32. Qxa7
{was a simpler win - something I only saw while Black was considering his 29th
move.}) 28... Qxb7 29. Rxa7 Qb8 30. Rxf7 $1 Kxf7 31. Bxe5 Bxe5 32. Ncxe5+ Kg7
33. Ng4 $1 {The finish of a long tactical line. The fact that White started a
breakthrough on the queenside followed by a kingside attack was rather
pleasing. The combination of the queen and 2 knights was simply overwhelming
and Black had no chances to hold this.} Qb2 34. Qxh6+ Kh8 35. Nfe5 Rc7 36. exd5
Qb4 37. Re4 Qc3 38. Kg2 (38. Nf6 $4 Qc1+ {would have been a really sad finish
to the game.}) 38... Qc1 39. Rf4 Qc3 (39... exd5 40. Nxg6+) 40. Nxg6+ Kg8 41.
