1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. b3 d5 4. Bb2 Be7 5. e3 {Sparing me another annotation
of a b3 Catalan.} O-O 6. Nc3 c5 (6... b6 $1 $11 {would have been more in
keeping with the logic of Anish's main game today- avoiding potentially
awkward hanging-pawns formations.}) 7. cxd5 {Just as theorised in the notes to
the main game, this is the way White should play. Obviously d4 is fine
immediately, but why not make Black play with a central structure he doesn't
like?} Nxd5 8. Nxd5 exd5 (8... Qxd5 9. Bc4 Qd6 10. O-O Nc6 $11 {still looks
fine for Black, if a bit passive}) 9. d4 Qa5+ {Technically the novelty.} (9...

Qd2 Qxd2+ 11. Kxd2 Nc6 12. dxc5 Bxc5 13. Bb5 {So the position is still fine
for Black, but White is taking no risks, and can choose to play against the
IQP 'as is' or maybe with some kind of Bxc6, Rfc1, Bd4-c5 thing. Ideal for
blitz.} Bb4+ 14. Ke2 Be6 (14... Ne7 $14 {might not have been a terrible idea
under the circumstances}) 15. Rac1 Rac8 16. Rhd1 (16. Bxc6 bxc6 17. Ne5 {
was a useful tactical chance: Black can either sacrifice the pawn or allow} c5

18. Bd3 Nb4 19. Bb1 Rxc1 20. Rxc1 Rc8 21. Rd1 Nc6 22. g4 {Thinking about Bf5,
and also restricting Black's kingside pawns, allowing for a future f4-f5
thrust.} h6 23. Nd4 Nxd4+ 24. Bxd4 Ba3 25. f4 {Like that.} f6 26. Bg6 (26. e4
dxe4 27. Bxe4 $14 {looked quite convincing, even though it liquidates the most
immediate target of White's pressure.}) 26... Kf8 27. Kf3 Ke7 28. h4 (28. b4 $5
{was worth noticing, but after} Bxb4 29. Rb1 a5 30. a3 Bd6 31. Rxb7+ Rc7 32.

30. e4 {Eventually White had to make this break, though he has spent enough
time in the process that Black is probably objectively fine again.} Bc3 $6 (

previous note, except Black's pieces are now out of sync.} (34... Bb4 35. Be3 (
35. Kf5 Rc2 36. Bd4 Kf7 $1 $11) 35... Ke6 36. a4 $14 {Black has not completely
equalised here, but it's better than the game.}) 35. f5+ Ke7 36. Rc1 {Forcing
a favourable bishop endgame.} Rc6 $2 {Definitely losing and almost certainly
the decisive mistake.} (36... Kd7 37. Kd3 Bb4 38. Rxc8 Kxc8 39. Kc4 Bd6 40. Kd5
Kd7 41. a4 $16 {might also be winning, or it might not- but White can play
with various ideas, like Bd4 and then g5, or Bc5 at the right moment. I
suspect Black has just enough answers.}) 37. Kd3 Bb4 38. Rxc6 bxc6 39. Kc4 Bd6

The last idea is to try and trap this bishop, but White can just go back and
pick a better time for the incursion.} 43. Bc5 Kd7 (43... Bc7 {was another
place to try and defend from.} 44. Kb4 Bd8 (44... a5+ 45. Ka4 Bd8 46. b4 axb4

has to play ...a5, and then the game is almost over.} a5+ 47. Kc4 Be3 48. b4

same time.} Bf4 47. Bf8 Kb6 ({of course, after} 47... Kd7 48. Ka5 Ke8 {White
is not obliged to take on g7, but can conserve his bishop with} 49. Bc5 $18)

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d3 ({Anish isn't interested in
going} 5. d4 {like Gawain Jones against Karjakin!}) 5... d6 {The risky
positions with ...d5 pushes can wait for another day.} 6. O-O a6 7. Re1 (7. a4
{is the main move, just in case Black wants ...b5.} Ba7 8. Re1 O-O (8... h6 9.
Nbd2 g5 10. b4 Nh5 11. Nb3 g4 12. b5 {led to a messy, but possibly prepared,
draw in Karjakin,S -Carlsen,M London 2017}) 9. h3 h6 10. Nbd2 Re8 11. b4 Be6
12. Bxe6 Rxe6 13. Nf1 {White has acheived his opening goals, which are however
so modest that we are not left sure as to whether he has an advantage.
Nevertheless, this was a rare Carlsen loss: Vachier Lagrave,M-Carlsen,M Paris
2017}) 7... Ba7 8. Bb3 O-O 9. h3 h6 {Most solid and least committal. It is in
general useful to control the g5-square, either to push a pawn there or just
to prevent Bg5 and Ng5 ideas.} (9... Ne7 $5 {is a maximalist idea: Black does
not need to make kingside pawn pushes, at least right now, to exploit White's.}
10. Nbd2 Ng6 11. Nf1 Nh5 $5 (11... c6 {is a valid change of direction used by
Carlsen before.} 12. Ng3 d5 13. exd5 Nxd5 14. d4 exd4 15. Nxd4 h6 16. Bc2 Re8

V St Petersburg 2000}) 10. Nbd2 Re8 11. Nf1 Be6 12. Bc2 (12. Bxe6 Rxe6 13. Qc2

probably equalises anyway with} d5 $11) 12... d5 13. Qe2 dxe4 14. dxe4 Qe7 15.
Ng3 {In principle if one wants to win in this opening one should keep both
bishops alive.} (15. Be3 {would have been a slightly challenging, if not very
inventive try.} Bxe3 16. Qxe3 Rad8 17. Ng3 {and now Black has to find some
idea. Maybe a good one is} Nd7 $5 $11 {with ...Qc5 to come.}) 15... Rad8 16.
Nh4 Qf8 17. Nhf5 (17. Qf3 $5 {was a useful intermezzo, to make Black worry
about Bxh6.} Kh7 18. Ngf5 (18. Nhf5 Ng8 $11 {is a bit more of a brick wall})
18... Ng8 19. g4 $5 g6 20. g5 {The attack turns out to be rather strong if
Black takes the piece, so he should maybe consider a move like} Nce7 $1 $11 {
to de-fang it a bit first.}) 17... Ne7 18. Ne3 Ng6 19. Ngf5 Nf4 20. Qf3 c6 $6 {
Allowing White a reasonably dangerous piece sacrifice.} (20... g6 21. Ng3 Nh7
$1 $17 {and suddenly Black is White!}) 21. Ng4 $1 Nxg4 22. hxg4 g6 {There
isn't really an alternative but to give up the piece now, but thankfully for
White he doesn't mind doing so.} 23. Bxf4 (23. Nd4 Nxg2 24. Kxg2 exd4 $15 {
is just a pawn and there isn't much to show for it.}) 23... exf4 24. Qxf4 gxf5

terrible for Black}) 26. fxe6 Rxe6 (26... fxe6 27. Bb3 Rd3 $14 {gave better
counterplay, but White is probably still better.}) 27. Rad1 Rde8 28. Re2 Qg5
29. Qf3 (29. Qxg5+ hxg5 30. g3 $16 {is just a pawn, and White could have taken
his time to try and convert, in the manner of Magnus himself.}) 29... Rf6 30.

Most natural and perfectly fine.} (32... Qg4 $5 33. Qxe5 Rg6 34. Qe8+ Kg7 35.
Qe5+ Kh7 $44 {could even be a winning try, despite initial appearances.}) 33.
g3 (33. Rd1 {was White's paradoxical last way to play for something, but in
practice and especially in blitz Black's compensation is tremendous.} Rf4 $44)

One can hardly be too critical of this move, but it isn't best.} (35... Rf3 {
was hardly rocket science and won on the spot:} 36. Kg2 Rh5 37. Qg1 Rf4 $1 {
and White's pieces are by now so awkwardly placed that mate is unavoidable.})
36. Bd1 Qg5 37. Rd3 {Responding to the threat of ...Rf3 three moves late, and
by now it is ...Re3 instead, but White's position is bad anyway.} (37. Qh4 {
was probably the way to execute the idea.}) 37... Ref5 38. Qh4 {With a draw
offer, which presumably was only accepted to let the opponent save face,
because Black has a vast advantage and two extra pawns here.} 1/2-1/2
