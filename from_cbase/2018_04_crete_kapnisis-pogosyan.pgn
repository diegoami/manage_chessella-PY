1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 {Bringing about the first of 2 Maroczy structures in
the games of the young Russian talent. However, for various reasons, including
the one played, this particular flavour of Maroczy is less favoured than say 2.

once looked at}) 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nf6 6. Nc3 Bb4 {Black knows that his
strength is in endgames, so heads to one with a minimum of delay on this and
the next move.} ({Following} 6... Bc5 {the endgame is also close to forced:} 7.

mistake.} (7... dxc6 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. Bf4 $11) 8. e5 Ng8 9. Ne4 $1 Qb6 10. Nxc5

Nimzo-type position after} 10. f4 Bxc3+ 11. bxc3 b6 $132) 10. a3 Bxc3+ 11. bxc3

but in my opinion Black had already almost committed to doing this 2 moves ago.

in fact may end up being forced to exchange itself unfavourably on c5.} 12. h4

worse after some subtlety.} 13. Rh3 (13. h5 c5 14. Rh4 Ng5 $1 15. Rg4 Ke7 $44)

10 (!) further moves in a game I witnessed firsthand. Edouard,R-Wells,P

kingside will not help Black at all, and a future Rh4 will be good for
harrassing the e4-knight.} h6 14. Be3 Nc5 15. Rh4 Ke7 16. Rg4 Rhg8 17. O-O-O (

15. axb6 axb6 16. Ra7 {This is best play from both sides since ...Nxc3, as
well as being completely natural. White's compensation is not in doubt, but
Black can also be cautiously optimistic, since compensation has a way of
mysteriously evaporating.} Bd7 $6 (16... Rf8 17. Bd3 Nc5 18. Bxh7 {was an old

is} Ra8 20. Rxb6 $1 $18) 19... Rhd8 20. Bf3 Ke8 $16 {Now Black is at least
basically fine again in the short-term, and White would be well advised to
spend a majority of his time here thinking about exactly which endgames to
enter.} 21. Bxc5 bxc5 22. h4 f6 23. Be4 (23. Rd6 $5 {reaches a pawn-up rook

because White has a very obvious plan of pushing his g- and h-pawns until they
form a queen, and this will necessitate Black giving up his bishop. However,
Black has a reasonable range of resources at his disposal, including rook
challenges on the d-file.} 26. Be2 (26. Bxe4 Rxc4 27. Raxd7 Rxd7 28. Bxc6 Rcd4

White's pawn had one extra tempo, there would have been Rxd7 on the last move.}
