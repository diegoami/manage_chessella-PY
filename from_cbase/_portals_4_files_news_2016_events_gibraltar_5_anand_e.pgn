kingside to later counter in the centre.} (10. Nd2 $5) 10... g5 11. Nc3 {I
have to admit that I do not really like Anand's concept here. Now White no
longer has the central break d3-d4 and the maneuver g3 followed by f4 - which
White played in the game - seems to be very risky. However, White has to find
some counterplay, otherwise Black just continues with his attack.} Ne7 12. g3

position both sides were aiming for. White has the better structure which
guarantees him a long-term advantage - if he is not mated before. Thus, the
crucial question is whether White will be able to weaken Black's attack by
exchanging pieces.} 20. Bxe5 Qxe5+ 21. Qf4 Qc5 (21... Qf6 $5 {[%cal Gf6h4]})

necessary - though the resulting position looks pretty attractive for Black.
But White can hold.} ({After} 23... Qd4 $17 {[%cal Gd4f6,Gc6c5] White has a
