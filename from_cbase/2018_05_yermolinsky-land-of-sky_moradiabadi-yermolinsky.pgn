1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+ 4. Nbd2 d6 {I knew I was making a bad choice.
This is not the 1990's anymore. There's no mystery left in classic Bogo
structures, and everybody knows how to handle them with White.} 5. g3 Nc6 $6 (
5... O-O 6. Bg2 Qe7 7. O-O e5 {is a relatively better choice. At least White
can't win tempi with d4-d5, while} 8. Nb3 exd4 9. Nfxd4 a5 10. a3 Bc5 {is
quite acceptable for Black.}) 6. Bg2 e5 7. d5 Bxd2+ 8. Nxd2 Ne7 $6 {A real
error.} ({I forgot my own game with Ljubo Ftacnik where I went} 8... Nb8 9. O-O
O-O 10. Qc2 a5 {and more or less stayed afloat.}) 9. e4 O-O 10. O-O Ng6 11. Qc2
Ne8 (11... c6 {is typical for the Bogo, but here White is hardly bothered by
it. He can simply go} 12. dxc6 ({The line} 12. b3 cxd5 13. cxd5 b6 14. Nc4 Ba6
15. a4 Rc8 16. Ba3 {illustrates Black's problem with his Ng6, which should
have been on or near the key c5-square.}) 12... bxc6 13. c5 d5 14. exd5 cxd5
15. Nb3 Bb7 16. Bd2 Qc7 17. Rac1 $14 {with great prospects on the Q-side,
while Black isn't getting much out of his central pawn pair.}) 12. c5 $1 {[#]}
dxc5 {I was already fishing in troubled waters.} (12... f5 13. exf5 Bxf5 14.

preferable to what I did}) 18. Rac1 Rf7 19. h4 Bg4 20. Ng5 f3 21. Nxf7 $6 {
Elshan played it quickly, but the resulting positions offer Black some
fighting chances he didn't deserve.} ({Instead,} 21. Bh1 {just clinches it:}

forcing White to sac the queen:} 25. Qxc8+ Bxc8 26. Rxc8+ Nf8 27. Rfc1 {
Then if Black hits on the active plan of counterplay,} g5 28. Ra8 Qb4 29. Rcc8
Qd2+ 30. Kh3 h5 31. Rxf8+ Kg7 {he will earn himself a draw by perpetual check.}

back anyway.} 24. gxh4 Qxh4 25. Qc3 {A timely retreat.} (25. Rc3 $2 Rc8) (25.

his position remains much superior.} 26. Rfe1 Qxe4+ 27. f3 Qg6+ 28. Kf2 Bb5 29.
Rg1 $2 ({Here he calculated} 29. Qb4 Rf8 30. Qxb5 Ng5 {and became a bit
nervous. In reality} 31. Re3 Ne4+ 32. Rxe4 Qxe4 33. Qe2 {beats it off with
ease.}) 29... Qf5 {Perhaps, not the best square.} ({In case of} 29... Qf6 {
I was annoyed by} 30. Qe3 Rd8 31. f4) 30. Qe3 Rd8 31. Qe4 Qf6 32. Rc7 {[#]} Ng5

settled just yet.}) 33. Qg4 h6 ({I knew I had to go} 33... Rf8 {but the
endgame after} 34. Rxg7+ Kxg7 35. Qxg5+ Qxg5 36. Rxg5+ Kh6 37. Rxe5 Rf7 38. Ke3

winning.} e4 (34... Rxd5 35. Bxg5 hxg5 36. Qxg5) 35. Bxg5 hxg5 36. Qe6+ Qxe6
