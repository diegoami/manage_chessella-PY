1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3 dxc4 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. O-O $5 {Mamedyarov
is already showing he wants to steer today's game along a risky path!}
(6. Qa4 {is the alternative, leading to much too calm endgames. Catalan
is a fine opening when everyone is involved - you can take it easy or
play instead like Mamedyarov} Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Nd5 8. Bxb4 Ndxb4 9. O-O Rb8
10. Na3 O-O 11. Qb5 b6 12. Qxc4 Ba6 13. Nb5 Qd5 14. Qxd5 Nxd5 15. a4 Na5
16. Ne5 {1/2-1/2 (34) Anand, V (2800)-Kramnik,V (2780) Bilbao 2010 CBM
139 [Edouard,R]}) 6... Rb8 {Now Black is the liberty to threaten to
defend the c4-pawn possibly with ...b5.} 7. e3 Be7 (7... b5 8. b3 cxb3
9. axb3 $44) 8. Nfd2 { White backtracks to prevent b5, but reduces his
control of the center and so lets Caruana get in} e5 $ 5 {too. A similar
position but with ...a6 instead of ...Be7 has been played many times,
including by Mamedyarov from the black side. It is clear that this
version is better for Caruana.} 9. Bxc6+ bxc6 10. dxe5 Ng4 11. Nxc4 Be6

{1/2-1/2 (21) Van der Stricht,G (2424) -Hausrath,D (2507) Belgium 2008})
12... h5 13. f3 Qd3 {a little less crazy approach. White has "only" two
pawns extra, and black has close to full compensation.} (13... h4 $5
{can't be dismissed either, but leads to equality.} 14. fxg4 hxg3 15.
Qf3 (15. hxg3 Qd3 $44 {[%csl Rc4][%cal Ge6d5]}) 15... Rxh2 16. Qxg3 Rh4
17. Rf4 Qd3 $44) 14. fxg4 Bxc4 15. Nxc4 Qxc4 16. gxh5 {both were still
playing quickly up until now, so it is clear that this was still home
preparation. Caruana, happy to take a half a point off Mamedyarov with
the black pieces is nevertheless not playing for one - generally a wise
move. In any case, he probably has enough compensation for the material
deficit: a weak white king, poor development of the queenside and a
shattered pawn structure. Still, two pawns are two pawns and Mamedyarov
could certainly be just as satisfied.
} Qe6 {Caruana finally spent time thinking on this one.} 17. Qf3 $ 5 {
I like this modest move, but considering the king position it's probably
a reasonable solution. Mamedyarov angles to get the queens off as soon
as possible.} Rb5 18. Qf5 Rxe5 19. Qxe6 Rxe6 { By the time Mamedyarov
arranges a queeen exchange, Caruana recapture at least one of the pawns.
And for the remaining pawn he should still have enough compensation.}
20. Rf5 (20. g4 $2 g6 21. hxg6 Rxg6 22. Rf4 Bd6 $17) 20... Rd6 (20...

Caruana} 24. Rxe7+ Kxe7 25. Ba3+ Rd6 26. Rc1 Kd7 27. Bxd6 cxd6 $11) 24.
hxg6 fxg6 25. e4 {[%cal Re5e7]} Rh7 26. h4 {Caruana probably
overestimated this position when he was weighing 23 ... c5 against the
simple solution 23 ...Rxh5 decided} Rf7 {probably the best solution for
Caruana. But the resulting endgame was no fun.} (26... Kf8 $2 27. Bh6+
$18 ) (26... Kd7 $6 27. Rd5+ Rxd5 28. exd5 $14) 27. Kh3 $1 {White's king
is safe here and can be activated quickly at the right moment.} Rff1 28.

Rxa2 31. Be7+ $6 {the first step in the wrong direction - the bishop
will later be AWOL from defending the g3 pawn.} (31. e5 {and Caruana has
one difficult task ahead} Re2 32. Rxc5 $14 {[%csl Gf4][%cal
Gg5f4,Gh3g4,Gg4g5]}) 31... Kg8 32. Rc8+ Kg7 33. Bxc5 Re2 34. e5 Rd1 $1

offside and Caruana is in time to gain counterplay against g3.} Re3 37.

enough activity.} 41. Kg4 Rxg3+ 42. Kf4 Rgf3+ 43. Ke4 Rfe3+ 44. Kf4 Rf3+
45. Kg5 Rf7 46. e6 Rd5+ $1 {Caruana finds a very clean solution and the
draw is ready to be signed.} 47. Kxg6 Rxd6 48. Rxf7 Rxe6+ 49. Rf6 Re4
