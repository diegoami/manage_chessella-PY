1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 Nxd5 $5 5. e3 ({Principled lines are
connected with e2-e4 (as Magnus twice successfully played in 2016 in the short
control games against Kramnik) or} 5. Nf3 {first.}) 5... c5 $1 6. Bd3 ({A rare
continuation, which was used by Geller sixty years ago but was not seen often
after that. More standard is} 6. Nf3 {, transposing to Carlsen's own 2010
rapid game against Hammer.}) 6... cxd4 7. exd4 Nxc3 $5 {Indeed, there were
alternatives for Black here and on the previous move.} 8. bxc3 Qc7 9. Bd2 Nd7
$1 10. Qg4 $5 {This is probably new.} Nf6 ({Also} 10... g6 {is playable.}) 11.
Qg3 $1 Qxg3 12. hxg3 {The world champion obtained a slightly better endgame.
Surely nothing special, but often he does not need much.} Bd6 13. Nf3 ({
Curious and probably deserves mentioning} 13. Rh4 $5 {, preparing g3-g4. While}
e5 {can be met by} 14. dxe5 Bxe5 15. Nf3 {followed by 16.Kf1!.  But developing
a knight, as Carlsen did, is very natural.}) 13... b6 {Black could have tried
to do without this move, developing the bishop to d7. But generally there's
nothing wrong with Hou Yifan's approach.} 14. a4 $1 Bb7 15. a5 Ke7 16. Ke2 Ne4
17. Be1 $5 {Otherwise White can't preserve his bishop pair.} h6 18. c4 Nf6 $6 {
I do not like this retreat, after which White activates easily.} ({Instead,} 
18... f5 $5 {looks OK, with decent counterchances for Black.}) 19. Bc3 $1 Be4 {
Also this is somewhat illogical. Now White quickly develops a strong pressure.}
20. Rhb1 Bxd3+ 21. Kxd3 Nd7 22. Nd2 $5 Rhd8 ({The alternative} 22... f5 {has
serious drawbacks because it weakens the e6 pawn.}) 23. Ne4 Bc7 24. Bb4+ Ke8 {
Black's position is passive and nearly critical. But, somewhat strangely, it's
also hard to offer something absolutely convincing for White.} 25. f4 ({
Instead,} 25. Kc3 $5 f5 26. Bd6 $1 Bxd6 27. Nxd6+ Ke7 28. Nb5 {also deserved
attention, probably, and can be better than it looks.}) 25... Rac8 26. axb6
axb6 27. Ra7 {Essentially, White goes for a promisingly looking exchange
sacrifice.} ({He also could have played calmer:} 27. Nc3 $5 Nc5+ ({or} 27...
Bb8 28. Ra8 Nc5+ 29. Bxc5 bxc5 30. Rb7 $1 {with the idea of} Rxd4+ 31. Ke2 Rdd8
32. Nb5 g5 33. Na7 Bxa7 34. Raxa7 {, etc.}) 28. Ke3 Nd7 29. Re1 $1 Bb8 30. Kd3
{and Black is worse after} Nc5+ $5 31. Bxc5 bxc5 32. d5 Kf8 {as well as in
other lines.}) 27... Nb8 $1 28. Rxc7 $1 Rxc7 29. Nd6+ Kd7 30. Nxf7 Rdc8 {White
has more than enough for the sacrificed exchange, but is it enough for a win?
Possibly not.} 31. Ne5+ ({Or} 31. Bd6 $5 Ra7 (31... Rb7 $6 32. Be5 $1) 32. Rxb6
({Black also should be able to survive the bizarre} 32. f5 $5 exf5 33. d5)
32... Ke8 33. Ne5 Nd7 34. Nxd7 Kxd7 35. Bc5 $5 Re8 $1 {and it's not clear how
White can make progress.}) 31... Ke8 32. Bd6 Rb7 $1 33. c5 Nc6 $1 34. Rxb6 Rxb6
35. cxb6 {Further, Hou Yifan continued to defend a not-so-simple ending well,
until her fatal mistake on the 50th move,} Nd8 $5 36. Bc7 Ra8 37. Kc4
Nb7 ({Also possible was} 37... Ra2 $5 {where White should avoid} 38. Kc5 ({
other options:} 38. Kb5 $5) (38. g4 $5) 38... Ra5+ 39. Kd6 $4 {(well, Magnus
would not play this even in the bullet)} Rd5#) 38. Kb5 Ra2 39. g4 Ke7 $5 40. g3
$5 Nd6+ $1 41. Bxd6+ Kxd6 42. Nc4+ Kd7 43. Kc5 Rc2 $1 44. f5 exf5 45. gxf5 Rf2
46. Nd6 $1 ({After} 46. g4 {,} h5 $1 47. gxh5 Rxf5+ 48. Ne5+ Kc8 49. Kc6 Rf6+ {
is an easy draw for Black.}) 46... Rg2 ({She could have tried} 46... h5 $5 {
(disallowing White to connect his g and f-pawns), which seems to be an easier
way to a desired result for Black.}) 47. Ne4 Rb2 48. g4 $1 Rb1 49. Nd2 $1 Rh1
$5 50. d5 h5 $2 {It was necessary to abstain from this advance.} ({The waiting
strategy was correct. For example,} 50... Rc1+ 51. Nc4 Rb1 $5 52. Ne5+ Ke7 ({
but not} 52... Kd8 $2 53. Kc6 $1 $18 {and after} Rc1+ {White has} 54. Kd6) 53.
d6+ Kd8 54. Kc6 Rc1+ {and if} 55. Kd5 Rb1 $1 {. But it's difficult to
understand that Black can save a game by playing like this.}) 51. d6 $1 $18 {
Now it's over.} Kc8 ({Or} 51... hxg4 52. b7 Rh8 53. Nc4 $1 Rb8 54. Ne5+ $1 Ke8
({if} 54... Kd8 55. Nc6+) 55. Kc6 g3 56. Kc7 Rxb7+ 57. Kxb7 g2 58. Kc7 g1=Q 59.
d7+ Ke7 60. d8=Q#) 52. gxh5 Rxh5 53. Kc6 {The black rook is misplaced.} Kb8 54.
Ne4 Rxf5 55. Nc5 {One may feel sorry for the Chinese star who made so many
strong moves but still lost this game.} 1-0
