1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 {To my mind, a fairly
underestimated line, and the reason I don't often play the Petroff now.} (5. c4
{is an interesting attempt at playing move-orders, but I think Black is
considered to be fine after} Nc6 $11) (5. d4 {is the main move.}) (5. Qe2 {
was the first game, Carlsen-Caruana.}) 5... Nxc3 (5... Nf6 {would have been an
interesting choice against Giri, considering he has championed the Black side.
From what I understand, the point for White is to avoid the impulse to play
too early against the c8-bishop, because that will simply encourage a
fianchetto and Black will be fine.} 6. d4 Be7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. O-O Re8 9. Re1 $1 {
The point of this is to force Black to commit his light-squared bishop one way
or another. Even moves that do not obviously do this- such as ...d5- really do
make a decision, because they make the fianchetto rather undesirable. White
can play against either ...Bg4 or ...b6, but should do so in different ways
and definitely should not commit to h3 just yet.} ({Following the immediate} 9.
h3 b6 $1 {Black was soon fine in Vachier Lagrave,M-Giri,A Germany 2012.}) 9...
Nbd7 10. Bf4 {White is slightly better, for instance} Nf8 11. h3 b6 12. Bb5 Bd7
13. a4 $14) 6. dxc3 Be7 7. Be3 {The choice is between this move and Bf4. The
current move allows Black lots of ...Ne5 possibilities, which I believe he
should take.} (7. Bf4 {meanwhile does not gel so well with the rest of White's
kingside attack.} O-O 8. Bd3 Nd7 9. Qd2 Nc5 $11 {for instance seems fine for
Black.}) 7... Nc6 8. Bd3 Be6 {White should play one of the queen moves and
then castle queenside, and I think given that White has played Be3, Black
should castle queenside too. No surprise then that the present game continued
in that way.} 9. Qe2 (9. Qd2 Qd7 {was similar enough and a game of mine:
Jackson-Fernandez, Coventry 2013.}) 9... Bf6 10. O-O-O Qe7 (10... Qd7 {is more
natural to me, not worrying about White's Ng5 ideas, but more concerned with
cuing up ...Bf5 in future.}) 11. Kb1 a6 12. Rhe1 O-O-O 13. h3 Rhe8 (13... h5 {
is trivially easy to recommend in hindsight, but it should have been
reasonably obvious that White wanted kingside space.}) 14. g4 h6 15. Nd2 $1 $14
{Now White is probably a tiny bit better, but obviously an incredible amount
of technique and further errors need to be played out over the board before
White can think about winning.} Bg5 16. f4 Bh4 17. Bf2 Bxf2 18. Qxf2 Qf8 19. f5
{Opting to set Black more direct problems, but ceding the e5-square. While I
am not sure this is the best continuation, it could be the most practical,
especially against slightly lower-rated opposition.} (19. Nf1 {seems more
natural to me, waving the idea of Ng3-h5 around.}) 19... Bd7 20. f6 g6 (20...
Rxe1 21. Rxe1 g5 $11) 21. Be4 Kb8 22. Nc4 Re6 $6 {In practical terms, another
slight mistake. We obtain a similar structure to Carlsen-Caruana, but with the
minor pieces off the board Black faces more difficulties.} 23. Bxc6 $1 Rxe1 24.
Rxe1 Bxc6 25. Na5 Re8 26. Nxc6+ bxc6 27. Qg3 {The engine evaluation of 0.00 is
hopelessly unhelpful for looking at this position. What is important is that
White is marginally more active and has a better structure and advanced
f6-pawn. Giving variations is slightly pointless here, so I shall try and
confine myself to comments only.} Qh8 28. Re7 Rxe7 29. fxe7 Qe8 30. Qe3 Kc8 31.
h4 Kd7 32. Qxh6 Qxe7 33. b3 $14 {White will be able to fix the f7-pawn and of
course a6 is still a weakness also. Doubtless this endgame will be discussed
for a while to come, including fortress possibilities and better White tries,
but the contours of what White must aim for are now clear.} Qe4 34. g5 Qe5 35.
Qf8 Qd5 36. Kb2 c5 37. Qg8 Qf3 38. Qf8 Qd5 39. Qg7 Qf5 40. Qg8 Qf3 41. a4 Qf1
42. Qf8 Qf5 43. Qa8 Qf1 44. Qe4 {Again, in human terms White has acheived
something else- the centralisation of his queen. Black must wait around until
White shows what the next stage of his plan is- though presumably it must be
b4.} Kd8 45. Qg4 {A mini-zugzwang.} d5 46. a5 $1 Qe1 47. h5 {This simplifies
Black's task a little bit, but does not completely give equality.} (47. Qf4 Qe6
48. Qf2 Qe7 49. Qf1 Qe6 50. b4 $14 {is another try}) 47... gxh5 48. Qxh5 Qe6
49. Qh8+ Ke7 50. b4 cxb4 51. cxb4 Kd7 $11 52. Qd4 Kc8 53. Qf6 $5 {Even the
pawn endgame retains certain practical difficulties and would be an ideal
candidate for the next Naiditsch book.} Qxf6+ 54. gxf6 Kd7 55. Kb3 Kc6 $4 {
My educated guess is that this move arose out of a desire to win a moral
battle for tempi. Against 55.Kc3 Black had ...Kd6 in mind, and so it was
natural to try and avoid that 'critical square' with the present move... Well,
we may never know.} ({Black had to play} 55... Kd6 $1 {to draw, and the idea
is of course ...c5.} 56. c4 (56. Ka4 c6 57. Kb3 c5 $11) 56... c5 $1 57. b5 d4
58. b6 Kc6 59. Kc2 $11 {Both kings are stuck.}) 56. c4 {Suddenly White is
completely winning.} d4 (56... dxc4+ 57. Kxc4 Kd6 58. b5 axb5+ 59. Kxb5 Kd7 60.
a6 Kc8 61. Kc6 Kb8 62. a7+ {is even more trivial}) 57. Kc2 Kd6 58. Kd2 $3 {
Amazing tempo play, but stereotyped enough.The idea is that only after Black
recaptures on c5 must White play Kd3! as that position is a mutual zugzwang.} (
58. Kd3 c5 {is once again a draw.}) 58... c6 59. Ke2 {Avoiding the d3-square
for the last time.} Kd7 (59... Ke5 60. b5 $18) (59... c5 60. bxc5+ Kc6 (60...
Kxc5 61. Kd3) 61. Kd2 $1 Kxc5 62. Kd3 $18) 60. Kd3 Kc7 61. Kxd4 Kd6 62. Kd3 Kc7
63. Ke4 Kd6 64. Kd4 {Not an undeserved victory, but a slightly surprising one.}
