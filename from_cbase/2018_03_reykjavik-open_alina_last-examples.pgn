{The ladies prize was convincingly claimed by Deimante. She was defeated only
by the top seed, Rapport, gained 19 rating points and a...GM norm! This is an
excerpt from her games and a small exercise for you: Black to play and win.} 
30... f5 $1 31. Ba8 {There is nothing else available.} (31. exf6 {is also
losing after} Qh5+ 32. Kg2 Qxd1 33. Qxd1 Ne3+ $19) 31... Qc8 {A similar cage
as in the game Yilmaz Mustafa - Perelshteyn Eugene, but this time the bishop
is trapped instead of the knight.} 32. Bd5 exd5 33. e6 dxc4 34. exd7 Qc6+ 35.
Kf2 Bc5+ 36. Kf1 Qh1# {The 2nd time, and even right after his loss against
Richard Rapport, that Aleksandr Lenderman allows his opponent to deliver mate
on the board. A true gentleman. He might be disappointed by his score in the
Reykjavik Open but the Fischer Random Cup had a way better outcome - first
place for Lenderman with 7.5/9!} 0-1

{There is always a choice, so what would you play here with White? It took me
more than 30 minutes to play my next move, which I find unforgivable. Not
because I was deeply calculating (I was but maybe half of the time only) but
because I spent way too much time with my inner struggles. I am well aware of
Alina's heel, which is playing the moves I like instead of the ones the
position requires. And when I faced this situation, I contemplated 12.0-0, 12.
a4, 12.Nd6 - totally reasonable moves - but I was 99% sure I will go for} 12.
Nfxg5 $5 {My signature move. Since I didn't see a clear refutation, I knew I
was going to play it, so no need to burn so much time on the clock.} Nxg3 13.
hxg3 hxg5 {On the other hand, the ramifications and evaluations at the end of
the lines do need some thinking.} 14. Qc2 {is what I played since in the line
with} (14. Bxc4 bxc4 15. Qh5 Re8 16. Qh7+ Kf8 {I missed} 17. Rh5 $1 {and White

ensuing position would still be a mess - which I wouldn't have mind.}) 14... f5
15. exf6 Rxf6 16. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {This is exactly what I expected once I decided
in favour of the sacrifice. I just didn't know for sure how to asses it. I
felt that with a couple of precise moves, Black should consolidate and take
over but when ideas like a4, 0-0-0, f4, Bf3 appeared in sight, I couldn't
restrain. In the end the game finished in a draw but I cannot say it was a
clean one, for either side.} 1/2-1/2

{White's last move was 18. Ne4. How would you react with Black?} 18... Nxe4 {
Is what my opponent played, which gave me rather soon attacking perspectives.}

positionally. However, after} 19. fxe4 {it has to be backed up with another
strong move} Nf8 $1 {redirecting the knight; in case} 20. c5 {would come then}

pawns are now kept under strong supervision, whereas Black's queenside cavalry
