something of White's bishop positioning with} 8. Bc3 $5 {which contains some
interesting points although 8...Ne4 should equalise.}) 8. Qc2 (8. Na3 $5 {
was an interesting new direction in Aronian,L-Karjakin,S London 2017}) 8... c6

offer} Nh5 {forces White to then think of something new.}) 9... b6 (9... Ne4 {
might look natural, but concretely here White does not need to worry about the
threatened swap, e.g.} 10. a4 Nxd2 11. Nbxd2 a5 12. e4 {with a space advantage.

could have a little something here, especially if Black's best is ...Qa7, but
