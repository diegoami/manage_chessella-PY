{Before this game I had lost to Vishy in a complicated struggle, so for this
game I decided that I should just try and make a draw, (which is not an easy
task anyway) and not lose 3 out of the last four games, winning against van
Wely only by a miracle.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {I must admit that I
rather expected the Catalan here, but possibly because I had defended quite
confidently against his Catalan in the Tal he decided to switch this time} c5
4. g3 b6 5. Bg2 Bb7 6. O-O Be7 7. d4 (7. Re1 d5 8. cxd5 Nxd5 {hasn't given
White much lately, neither after} 9. d4 ({Nor} 9. e4 Nb4 $1) 9... cxd4 {
As for instance in Aronian-Jakovenko} (9... Nxc3 10. bxc3 Be4 11. Ne5 Bxg2 12.
Kxg2 O-O 13. e4 {Was probably somewhat better for White in Carlsen-Aronian,
Elista 2007.})) 7... cxd4 8. Qxd4 d6 9. Rd1 a6 10. Ng5 {A fairly old line I
think, which is not considered especially dangerous for Black if he's well
prepared. Unfortunately I couldn't remember anything, and so I had to start
thinking from this point.} Bxg2 11. Kxg2 Nc6 {I didn't find a comfortable way
to put this guy on d7, so I came up with this move, which is part of a plan
which turned out to have a reasonably good reputation.} 12. Qf4 O-O 13. Nce4
Ne8 {Retreating is considered to be the normal reaction to Ne4. The black
position is now slightly awkward, but the white knights are not perfectly
placed either.} 14. b3 Ra7 15. Bb2 Rd7 {This move is probably not really
necessary, but I thought that there was no better square for the rook anyway,
and overprotecting the d6-pawn might turn out to be useful at some point. I
had already spent a lot of time here, 45 minutes, but he had also spent some
time, almost 40 minutes, which left me feeling relieved that he was not still
in his preparation. Still, things are not really easy for Black. His
coordination is somewhat worse than it usually is in the hedgehog, and I found
it hard to find constructive waiting moves.} 16. Rac1 {h4 or Nf3 could also be
considered, but the text is quite reasonable as well.} Nc7 {I spent quite some
time on this move, which has the purpose of protecting e6, preparing f5. There
were of course alternatives, the most natural being the more hedgehog-like} (
16... Qa8 17. Nf3 b5 {I rejected it because I wasn't sure whether bxc4 bxc4
would really improve my position. That is why I decided that going for f5 and
g5 was just according to the demands of the position.}) 17. Nf3 f5 18. Nc3 g5 {
Not especially aggressive or anything, just a normal continuation of the plan
starting with Nc7.} 19. Qd2 (19. Qe3 g4 20. Nd2 {Not} (20. Nd4 Bg5 21. Nxc6
Bxe3 22. Nxd8 Bxc1 {winning an exchange.}) 20... Bg5 21. Qxb6 {was another,
computer-like option. I thought that I would have very good counterplay after}
Qa8 22. f3 $8 {and now just 22...Ne5 or even 22...Rb8 23.Qf2 Ne5 gives Black
active piece play and good compensation for a pawn.}) 19... g4 20. Ne1 (20. Nd4
$6 {would be worse, since now} Bg5 21. e3 Ne5 {leaves the knight practically
untouchable on e5. Note that it also makes it more difficult to create active
play for White, since b4 and c5 would be almost impossible to carry out, as
Rxd4 and a knight move to f3 would probably be strong then.}) 20... Bg5 {
An important element in my plan. The weak f3-square will now be a constant
worry for White.} 21. e3 Rff7 {A good prophylactic move, preventing Na4 and c5
and preparing to redeploy the knight with Ne8-f6-e4 without having to worry
about Nd5.} 22. Kg1 Ne8 23. Ne2 {A natural manoeuvre. The diagonal is opened
for his bishop and the knight is transferred to a better square.} Nf6 24. Nf4
Qe8 {I would have liked to play Ne4 immediately, but I rejected it because of
the queen sac:} (24... Ne4 25. Nxe6 $2 Qe8 26. Nxg5 Nxd2 27. Nxf7 {I don't
really understand why though, since, as any engine points out,} Ne4 28. Nh6+
Kf8 {with the point that 29.Nxf5 Qf7 wins for Black.}) 25. Qc3 (25. Bxf6 {
was an option, but at the same time it's hard to see how White can play for an
advantage after giving up this bishop.}) 25... Rg7 {I really wanted to get
that thing to e4. I felt that the position was about equal or maybe slightly
better for White, but I was rather worried that I would blow it before the
time-control, as I only had 17 minutes left here. At the same time I saw that
Kramnik clearly was suffering from a cold and was feeling uncomfortable, which
comforted me a little (thinking about my chances in this game that is!).} 26.
b4 Ne4 27. Qb3 Rge7 28. Qa4 $6 ({Rybka's suggestion of} 28. f3 gxf3 29. Nxf3
Bf6 {really doesn't impress me much, but}) (28. h4 {as suggested by Nigel
Short during my press-conference after the round was probably an improvement
of the white position, and certainly better than the text. After only h4 I can
only repeat my evaluation after my 25th move: equal or slightly better for
White. The knight on e4 is certainly pretty, but the f4-knight is a good piece
as well. It's not easy to take advantage of my weakened king, and not easy to
make any clear progress for either side.}) 28... Ne5 29. Qxa6 $2 (29. c5 {
is well met by} Nc4 $1 {so White should rather admit failure with}) (29. Qb3 {
after gaining two tempi Black is obviously slightly better, but the white
position is certainly playable.}) 29... Ra7 30. Qb5 {Having seen that} (30.
Qxb6 Reb7 31. Qd4 Bf6 {would leave his queen trapped in the centre, Kramnik
was forced to make this move, which he actually accompanied with a draw offer.
I was slightly tempted of course, since I would have been happy with a draw
before the game, but I realised that my position was so much better that I
simply had to decline.}) 30... Qxb5 31. cxb5 Rxa2 32. Rc8+ Kf7 33. Nfd3 Bf6 34.
Nxe5+ (34. Bxe5 dxe5 35. Rc6 Ng5 {is winning for Black.}) 34... dxe5 (34...
Bxe5 {was probably better, but in time-trouble I was reluctant to allow} 35.
Bxe5 dxe5 36. Nd3 {which however is well met by} Kf6 37. Rf8+ Kg7 38. Rd8 (38.
Rb8 Rd7 $19) 38... Nc3 39. Rf1 (39. Nxe5 Nxd1 40. Rxd1 {is better but should
lose as well.}) 39... Rd2 $1 {and wins.}) 35. Rc2 (35. Nd3 {leaves Black with
a pleasant choice between} Nxf2 {and} (35... Ng5 {so White should rather
retreat.})) 35... Rea7 36. Kg2 (36. Kf1 {was better, the king later headed in
this direction anyway.}) 36... Ng5 37. Rd6 $2 {This pseudo-active move makes
matters much worse for White, but Black had a practically winning positional
advantage anyway.} e4 38. Bxf6 Kxf6 39. Kf1 (39. Rxb6 Ra1 40. Re2 Nf3 {loses
at once.}) 39... Ra1 40. Ke2 (40. Rcd2 Rb1 41. Rd1 Rxb4 42. Rxb6 Rb2 {leaves
White defenceless against the threats of Raa2 and Nh3.}) 40... Rb1 {I made
this move with only some 15 or so left on the clock, but I actually even spent
some seconds on Rb1, so I wasn't really worried about losing on time.} 41. Rd1
(41. Rxb6 {leads to mate after the computer-like} {or loses a piece after} Rd7
(41... Raa1 42. Kd2 (42. Ng2 Nf3 $19) 42... Rxe1)) 41... Rxb4 42. Ng2 Rxb5 {
Black is obviously winning now, and White might as well have resigned here. I
understand that Kramnik chose to play on for a while though, as he couldn't
have been especially happy about the way things turned out.} 43. Nf4 Rc5 44.
Rb2 b5 45. Kf1 Rac7 46. Rbb1 (46. Kg2 {allows the exchange of one rook, which
is desirable for Black.} Rc1 47. Rxc1 Rxc1 48. Rxb5 Nf3 49. Ne2 Re1 50. Rb2 Kg5
{and White is completely tied up, he cannot even play h4 due to gxh3 and Re2.
Black will win by playing e5 and h7-h5-h4.}) 46... Rb7 47. Rb4 Rc4 48. Rb2 b4
49. Rdb1 Nf3 50. Kg2 Rd7 $1 {The last good move, forcing the exchange of one
rook. The rest doesn't require any comments.} 51. h3 e5 52. Ne2 Rd2 53. hxg4
fxg4 54. Rxd2 Nxd2 55. Rb2 Nf3 56. Kf1 b3 57. Kg2 Rc2 {I was obviously elated
to win with Black against (a slightly weakened I have to add) Kramnik, I
almost couldn't believe it. After this I again shared the lead, and even
though I couldn't make anything of my slight advantage in the last game and
win the tournament outright, I'm obviously very happy with my shared victory
with Aronian.} 0-1
