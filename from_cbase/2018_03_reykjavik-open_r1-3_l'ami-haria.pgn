1. d4 e6 2. e4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bd7 5. Nf3 Bc6 {The famous Fort Knox,
which I have tried myself, but with nothing like the results of my younger
compatriot. Though as we shall see, this result had little to do with the
opening.} 6. Bd3 (6. Neg5 {is probably the most critical move.} Nd7 $1 ({After
} 6... Bd6 {even the cavemanesque} 7. Nxf7 {causes problems:} Kxf7 8. Ng5+ Ke8
9. Bc4 Qf6 10. Nxe6 $40) (6... Be7 {is uninspiring:} 7. Bc4 Bd5 8. Bb5+ c6 (
8... Bc6 9. Qe2 $14) 9. Bd3 c5 (9... Bxf3 10. Nxf3 Nf6 11. O-O $14 {Jones,
G-Taylor,A Reading 2016}) 10. dxc5 Nc6 11. c4 Bxf3 12. Nxf3 $14) 7. Bc4 Qe7
$146 {This might be one way to go if I had to play this again.} (7... Bd5 $2 8.
Nxf7 $1 Kxf7 9. Ng5+ Ke8 $2 (9... Qxg5 10. Bxg5 Bxc4 11. b3 Ba6 12. c4 Ngf6 13.
O-O $16) 10. Nxe6 Bxe6 11. Bxe6 {White was already basically winning in Jones,
G-Fernandez,D England 2016.}) 8. O-O O-O-O 9. Re1 h6 10. Ne4 Ngf6 {White might
have a tiny something but Black is out of the danger zone and should not be
too worried.}) 6... Nd7 7. O-O Ngf6 8. Ned2 Be7 9. Nc4 (9. b3 O-O 10. Bb2 b6 {
is more standard but Black is fine here; he can continue with ...Bb7 and try
for ...c5, or else just push the a-pawn straightaway.}) 9... O-O (9... Be4 $5 {
deserves consideration}) 10. Na5 Bd5 {On a 'culture' level it is a good idea
to drag White's c-pawn forward two squares before giving up the bishop pair.}
11. c4 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 c6 13. Bd2 Qc7 14. b4 Rac8 15. Rad1 b6 (15... Rfd8 16. Bf4
$1 {was the point}) 16. Nb3 Rfd8 17. Rfe1 Ra8 18. c5 {Probably a bit of a
surprise, though White is still better after this.} (18. a4 a6 19. g4 $14 {
suggests itself, and Black must be careful not to run out of oxygen.}) 18...
Nd5 19. Rc1 bxc5 $6 (19... b5 20. a4 a6 $14 {forces White to be extremely
careful about his next few moves, otherwise Black will suddenly manage to
co-ordinate all his forces against the weak d4-pawn.}) 20. dxc5 Bf6 21. Be4 (
21. Qe4 g6 22. b5 $1 $16 {is what my engine screams for; suddenly d5 is no
longer so much of an outpost.}) 21... Ne5 22. Qg3 Qe7 23. Na5 (23. b5 $16)

Qg5 30. Rcd1 Rb8 31. Bxg6 {It isn't clear to me why White believed so much in
his mating ideas, because there are actually multiple ways to meet them.} (31.
g3 $16) 31... hxg6 32. Nc4 Rd8 33. Rd4 Rcd7 34. Nd6 (34. Na5 Rc7 35. g3 $14)
34... Qf6 35. Qg3 Ra8 (35... a5 $5 $11 {is also possible immediately.}) 36. Rh4
$6 {The first step on the very short road to disaster.} (36. Qh3 $14) 36... g5
$1 {Otherwise mate follows on the h-file!} 37. Rg4 $4 {And this loses a
further half-point!} (37. Rhd4 a5 $11) 37... Nc3 $1 {Just like that, White
loses an exchange and one of the biggest upsets of the tournament thus far has
been pulled off.} 38. Qd3 Nxd1 39. Qxd1 a5 40. h3 axb4 {Having passed move 40,
White was able to repent at leisure.} 41. Rxb4 Qc3 42. Qh5 Qxa3 43. Rc4 Qa1+
44. Kh2 Qe5+ 45. g3 Qd5 {Good tenacity and awareness by the young English
rising talent.} 0-1
