{It was always unlikely that there would be significant adventures in a game
between an outright leader, and someone who could not catch them. Thus, the
game went as expected.} 1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 (
5... g6 {could be slightly more interesting; notwithstanding that Black has no
strong incentive to win, he could still try and do so. Ruling out all kinds of
'safe' e3 setups is a logical way to do this. Then White might have to play a
Maroczy bind, which he might well be reluctant to do.} 6. Bf4 $6 Bg7 7. e3 Nh5
{and White might even be worse already.}) 6. Bf4 d5 7. e3 {Not the most common
setup for White by any means, but seen in a disproportionate number of
super-GM games, for instance we have seen Boris Gelfand, Magnus Carlsen, Wei
Yi and Wesley So play the White side; meanwhile MVL, Kramnik, Svidler and
Ponomariov have taken the Black side... I am guessing, but I suspect the
appeal for White is that Black's critical strategies involve Bb4xc3, and the
resulting structural damage will only persist for a certain length of time, i.
e. Black has to play fast.} Bb4 (7... Nxd4 8. Qxd4 $14 {has understandably
never appealed to anyone, even if the ending after} dxc4 9. Qxd8+ Kxd8 10. Bxc4

examine one example of each deployment.} 11. Be2 (11. Bd3 {could improve, and
then logical is} a5 $1 (11... dxc4 $6 12. Bxc4 Nd5 13. O-O Nxf4 14. exf4 {
when both sides have rather slapdash structures but White's bishop might be a
tiny bit better, and ideas like Rd1, Qa3-d6 are just around the corner.}) 12.

Ba6 13. Bxa6 Rxa6 14. Qd4 Ne8 $36 {Unfortunately, while the computer sees no
problems for White, it is next to impossible for him to generate any actual
play- this would not be the case if at some point he had taken on d5 and/or
the light squared bishops were still on.} 15. Rb1 f6 16. Qd3 Ra7 17. Rb6 e5 18.
