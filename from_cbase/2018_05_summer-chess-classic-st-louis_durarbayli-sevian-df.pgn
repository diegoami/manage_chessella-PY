1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. d3 d6 5. O-O g6 6. c4 {It is well worth
asking why this line exists. Surely White wasn't hoping for a structure with
Bxc6 and a Closed-Sicilian or Exchange-Ruy like clamp with lots of pawns on
light squares?} (6. d4 {is the main move, even having lost one tempo.} Bd7 7.
d5 Ne7 8. Bxd7+ Qxd7 9. Re1 Bg7 10. c4 O-O 11. Nc3 $14 {and both sides have
more or less what they were looking for.}) 6... Bg7 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Be3 {So we
have our answer. At the first moment when the option was serious, White chose
not to take on c6.} (8. Bxc6 bxc6 $15 {looks interesting until we realise that
Black wants to play with ...c5 and that he will additionally have time for any
space-gaining or reorganising moves that he needs, like ...Nd7-b8-c6-d4 or ...
f5-f4.}) 8... Ng4 9. Bg5 f6 10. Bd2 f5 {I wonder how much inspiration the
players were drawing from the game Prohaszka-Zherebukh at this moment?} (10...
Nd4 $15 {was a slightly better choice, not giving White the chance to take
decisive strategic action himself in the centre.}) 11. Bg5 (11. c5 $5 {makes
Black's opening triumph look quite a bit more ambiguous}) (11. h3 Nf6 12. Bxc6
bxc6 13. b4 {is the engine recommendation, and after} f4 $132 {we get a
standard race for play on opposite wings.}) 11... Nf6 {Black drifts over the
next few moves.} (11... Bf6 $1 {was the most principled decision.} 12. Bd2 f4
$1 {and the race continues}) 12. Nd5 (12. c5 $5 {is again an interesting call,
although White made it soon enough.}) 12... fxe4 13. dxe4 Bg4 (13... a6 14.
Bxc6 bxc6 15. Nxf6+ Bxf6 {would have been an interesting call for Black, which
he probably rejected in view of} 16. Bxf6 Qxf6 17. c5 $132) 14. c5 $2 {This is
clearly a miscalculation of some kind, because Black now obtains a monster
knight.} (14. Bxc6 bxc6 15. Ne3 Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Qb8 $1 $11 {and Black has to
play a few more accurate moves in order to hold equality with the worse minor
pieces}) 14... Bxf3 $1 15. Qxf3 Nd4 $15 {Black has clearly won the opening
battle.} 16. Qd3 (16. Qe3 $5 {The computer suggests some downright confusing
moves sometimes. From my perspective, this gains nothing after Black plays} Kh8
{when he will be threatening the b5-bishop for real.}) 16... c6 17. Nxf6+ Bxf6
18. Bc4+ Kg7 19. Bxf6+ Qxf6 20. cxd6 Qxd6 21. Rad1 Rad8 22. a3 g5 23. Qe3 Qg6
24. f3 Rf4 25. Rd2 h5 (25... b5 26. Ba2 g4 $15 {clarifies the situation more})
26. Rdf2 Rdf8 {Somewhere around here, Black's control of the game starts to
slip.} (26... b5 27. Ba2 a5 $15) 27. b4 Qh6 28. a4 Qd6 $6 29. b5 (29. g3 {
and now presumably Black's idea was to retreat his pieces and prepare ...g4,
when he can use the f3-square, however there isn't time.} Qg6 30. Kh1 R4f6 31.
f4 $1 $36) 29... Qc5 30. Bd3 Kh7 {Black once more looks like he is controlling
the game but bishops often demonstrate a remarkable propensity for playing
'around' opponents' pieces.} 31. bxc6 bxc6 32. Kh1 Qe7 33. g3 R4f7 34. f4 $1 {
The correct idea to break out of the bind. Black now has to think hard about
the possibility of being worse.} gxf4 35. gxf4 Qh4 $1 36. Qg3 $1 {Ensuring
that at least White won't lose.} Qxg3 37. hxg3 Rg7 38. Rg2 h4 $1 {Black in his
turn ensures that he won't lose!} 39. gxh4 Rxg2 40. Kxg2 exf4 41. Kh3 Kh6 42.
e5 f3 43. Rg1 f2 44. Rg6+ Kh5 45. Rf6 Rxf6 46. exf6 f1=Q+ 47. Bxf1 Kg6 $11 {
The draw is now totally ensured.} 48. Kg4 Kxf6 49. Bc4 Nf5 50. Ba6 Nd4 51. Kh5
