{Blitz doesn't give players any kind of "warm up" time. It's the race against
the clock from the starting gates. It seems Alexander wasn't quite mentally
ready for that.} 1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 O-O 6. e3 Nbd7

interesting novelty.} Nxc3 9. bxc3 c6 10. Bd3 $2 {I don't like this standard
bishop placement in this particular situation.} ({White should have prepared
for the upcoming e6-e5, by keeping his minor pieces away from the pawn fork.}

{Throughout this rather boring game Shakh avoided queen trades. His plan
apparently was to shuffle around aimlessly, trying to beat Magnus in his own
game. Then he paid the price.} 38. Qd5 $4 Re1+ 0-1
