9. h3 Re8 {I would personally prefer 9.... Re8 here before exchanging pawns on
d4 and only then place the Queen on b6 to attack squares d4 and b2. Black
usually gets a better grip on the game in this variation, limiting White's
chances. Malaysia's IM Mas Hafizulhilmi had played quite a few games with this
set-up in the past.} ({Kasparov had played 9... Qb6 in two notable games: He
drew against Shirov but lost to Huebner.} 9... Qb6 10. c5 {White pushes c4-c5
immediately to attack Black's queen.} dxc5 11. dxe5 Ne8 {White typically gets
the better game here with a strong centre and better piece coordination than
Black.} 12. e6 ({Huebner preferred 12. Na4 against Kasparov:} 12. Na4 Qa6 13.

d5 {A natural move for White to gain space and at the same time cut off the
Black queen's pressure on g2.} Qb6 {Black continues to cause White problems:
this time by getting his queen to b6, it holds back White's plans to move the
dark squared Bishop to f4 or e3.} ({The great David Bronstein had moved his
queen to d6 in this position:} 8... Qd6 9. Be3 b5 10. Qd4 e5 11. dxe6 Bxe6 12.

Borgo,G (2400)-Bronstein,D (2455)/Ubeda 1996.}) 9. Bc4 ({An older game had
seen the move 9. Be2.} 9. Be2 {This move is designed to prevent Black's Bg4.}
Bf5 10. Bf3 $6 {This is not accurate as with the White Bishop on f3, it is not
able to protect the c2 Pawn. Within only a few moves, it will be obvious that
Black's pressure on the White queenside pawns begins to pay off.} O-O-O 11. Qd2
g5 {Black decides that he can gain time with a kingside pawn advance.} 12. h3 (
{Also possible here is:} 12. g3 h5 13. h4 $5) 12... h5 {White is
running out of options here with his d5 Pawn, c2 pawn and b2 pawn under attack
by the black pieces, and tries to offer an exchange of queens.} 13. Qe3 Rd6
14. Qxb6 Rxb6 {Black continues to sustain his pressure on the white queenside
pawns.} 15. Bxg5 {White gives up the b2 pawn in exchange for Black's g5 pawn.
He also found a way to manoeuvre his knight from c3 to e3 to defend the c2 pawn.}
Rxb2 16. Nd1 Rb6 17. Ne3 Bg6 18. O-O Ne4 19. Bxe4 Bxe4 20. Bf4 Bg7 {Black's
position is better due to his more active and better coordinated pieces.} 21.

(2355)-Bianchi,G (2430)/Villa Martelli 1995.}) 9... Bg4 (9... Bf5 10. O-O O-O-O
11. Bb3 {White's bishop on b3 covers both the b2 and c2 pawns while also
protecting the d5 pawn.} e6 {Black exploits the d-file pin to play this
freeing move that will help develop his bishop.} 12. Be3 Qb4 13. Bg5 c6 14.

the decisive factor in this endgame. Inkiov,V (2472)-Nikolaidis,I (2522)/
Thessaloniki 2005.}) 10. Qd3 O-O-O {This is a very dynamic opening set-up
whereby White controls the centre and has greater space. But, in return Black
have very active pieces and good pressure on White's weak Pawns. Black also
found a way to castle early, on the queenside, and gets a pin along the d-file
on the white queen, but his kingside pieces, especially the f8 bishop, remain
dormant. If Black is able to untangle his kingside via e7-e6, e7-e5 or g7-g5
without too much structural pawn weakness concessions, he will be at least
equal if not better.} 11. h3 Bh5 12. Be3 {White decides to play actively here,
at the cost of the b2 pawn.} Bg6 (12... Qxb2 13. Rb1 Qa3 14. O-O Bg6 15. Qd4 c5
16. Qd2 e6 {White holds only a minimal advantage due to the more exposed black
king.}) 13. Qd2 $2 ({White should have just exchanged queens here. Instead the
queen move to d2 will only help Black as he sought to untangle his kingside
pieces...} 13. Bxb6 Bxd3 14. Bxd3 cxb6 15. O-O-O g6 {is equal.}) 13... Qxb2 14.
O-O Qxc2 $6 {Black got greedy here by grabbing a second pawn and giving White
counterplay along the c-file. He should have not taken the white c2 pawn but
instead should have continued to exploit the pin along the d-file on the white
queen by playing e7-e6! With that move, Black threatens Bf8-b4 to also pin the
white c3 knight and this would have given Black the absolute advantage.} (14...
e6 15. Rad1 (15. Bb3 Bb4 16. Bd4 c5 $1) 15... Bb4 16. Bd4 Nxd5 {Black has the
advantage.}) 15. Qd4 e5 16. Qa7 Qxc3 17. Bxa6 bxa6 18. Rac1 Bc2 19. Qxa6+ {
White is banking on this check of the black king, with the intention to force
a perpetual check to draw the game.} Kd7 20. Qb5+ Kc8 {Black conceded that he
has nothing better than the draw. Instead of the text move, he could perhaps
have tried:} (20... c6 $1 21. Qb7+ (21. dxc6+ Qxc6 22. Qxc6+ Kxc6 23. Rxc2+ Kd7

would lead to some risk if he carried on in this position.} 26. Qb5 Rd3 27.
Qa6+ Kf5 28. Qb7 Rd7 29. Qf3+ Ke6 30. a4 Rd5 {Black has already consolidated
his position and once he can stop White's passed a-pawn and exchanged queens,
he should win.}) 21. Qa6+ 1/2-1/2
