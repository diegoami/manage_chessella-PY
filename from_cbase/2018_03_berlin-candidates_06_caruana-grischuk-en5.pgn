of play is also possible, which Caruana tried against Grischuk in the same
position several years ago. Grischuk said afterwards that it felt strange to play
against a variation he helped popularise (4.e3) and he cited a game against
Nepomniachtchi as one of his "top three" in his career.} 6. Nc3 Nbd7 7. O-O e5 8.

choice of e3 (if there is such a thing as "a good Benoni"). The fact that
computers nowadays find the opening dubious was a topic of discussion throughout
the day. Grischuk is of the opinion that White's structural advantages are
counterbalanced by Black's active dark-squared bishop.[%clk 0:00:00]} 9. Nd2

have both been making natural moves. White has the bishop pair and a solid
centre, while black has two pawn weaknesses on d6 and a6 but activity on the
b-file and a good grip on the dark squares. A knight jump c7-b5-d4 is also in the
air. Engines give the edge to White, but in practice it could be easier to play
for Black.[%clk 0:00:00]} 19. Na4 {[%clk 0:00:00]} (19. Qc2 {was tried previously
