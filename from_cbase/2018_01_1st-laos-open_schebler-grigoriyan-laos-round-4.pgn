Nf4 Qc7 {With his text move, GM Grigoryan delays the e5 pawn break by one move,
but he keeps the queens on the board to have chances to play for a win.} ({
Another possible alternative is the immediate e7-e5 pawn push. But, this leads
to a queen exchange and the subsequent trading of minor pieces only lead to a
drawish endgame.} 8... e5 9. dxe5 Nxe5 10. Qxd8+ Rxd8 11. Be3 a6 12. Nxg6 hxg6
13. Be2 Nd3+ 14. Bxd3 Rxd3 {Equal.} 15. Bd4 c5 16. Bxf6 {It was agreed drawn
here. 1/2-1/2 Palac,M (2570)-Zenklusen,R (2392)/Biel 2007.}) 9. Be3 e5 10. dxe5
Nxe5 (10... Qxe5 11. Qd4 {White, now, forces an exchange of queens.} Qxd4 12.
Bxd4 O-O-O 13. O-O-O Bc5 {Black has equalised, but he would also have nothing
better than a draw. GM Grigoryan, having turned down an earlier variation of
queen trade is clearly looking for more than a draw out of this game.}) 11. Be2
Bd6 12. O-O (12. Qb3 O-O 13. O-O-O Neg4 14. Ne6 fxe6 15. Qxe6+ Bf7 16. Qxd6 {
White again would offer an exchange of queens here.} Qxd6 17. Rxd6 Nxe3 18.
fxe3 Bxa2 {Equal.}) 12... O-O 13. Re1 Rfe8 14. Nxg6 hxg6 15. Bd4 ({Better for
White to move his queen away from the d-file and place it temporarily on a4,
in order to put pressure on a7 and prevent Black from immediately moving his
rook from a8 to d8.} 15. Qa4 Ned7 16. Rad1 Nd5 17. Bd2 Nc5 18. Qc2) 15... Rad8
16. Qa4 c5 17. Bxe5 {White should not have given up his bishop pair here.} (17.
Be3 Nd5 18. Bg5 f6 19. Bd2 a6 20. c4 Nb6 21. Qc2 {Still roughly equal.}) 17...

19... Nxc3 20. bxc3 Bxc3 21. Ne3 Qe5 22. Rad1 Bxe1 23. Rxe1 Qc3 24. Kf1 ({As
an option is the immediate move of rook to d1.} 24. Rd1) 24... a6 25. Rd1 (25.
Bf3 Re7 26. Re2 Rd4 27. Qc2 Qa5 28. Kg2 Qc7 {White, despite having less
space than Black, should be able to hold this position.}) 25... Rxd1+ 26. Nxd1
(26. Qxd1 Qf6 (26... b5 27. Qd7 Qa1+ 28. Kg2 Qe5) 27. Qd7 Qe7 {White is very
close to getting a draw.}) 26... Qe5 27. Ne3 $6 ({Better is:} 27. Bf3 Qe1+ 28.
Kg2 Rd8 29. Qc2 {White's counter-play against the black pawns coupled with the
relatively safe white's king position, thanks for the combination of the
white's bishop on f3 and knight on d1 would enable white to hold this game.})
27... Qe4 $1 {Black, now, forces the exchange of queens in order to reach an
endgame where his rook and two pawns on the queenside is stronger than white's
knight and bishop.} 28. Qxe4 Rxe4 29. Nc2 b5 30. Ke1 Kf8 31. Kd2 Ke7 32. Bf3
Re6 {Black is winning.} 33. Bd5 Rf6 34. f3 g5 35. Ne3 Kd6 36. Kc3 Ke5 37. a3 c4
38. a4 Rd6 39. Be4 g6 40. g4 Rd7 41. axb5 axb5 42. Kb4 Rd4 43. Kc3 Rxe4 {GM
Grigoryan went for the most economical continuation: He gave up his rook for
White's bishop and with it, the rest of White's kingside pawns will fall in
the coming moves.} 44. fxe4 Kxe4 45. Nc2 Kf4 46. Nd4 Kxg4 47. Nxb5 Kh3 48. Nd6
