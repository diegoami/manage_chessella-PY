31... Kg7 {The White Rook on a1 is like a rat in the maze. With his following
moves Pashikian tries to lure his opponent in opening the position up.} 32. Qd2

for Black! But is takes much more to make a little pierce in White's fortress.}

I expected g5-g4 to be played by Pashikian. If White doesn't react Black will
place a Rook on g5, whereafter h5 will fall.} 51. Qxg4+ Kf8 52. Qg6 {was most
likely the reason why Pashikian didn't enter in this line. However, Black can
just defend and rely on the fact that the Rook on a1 and Bishop on b1 are not
taking part in the game.} Rf7 53. g4 Rg8 54. Qxh6+ Ke7 {with Rf7-g7-g4 as
follow up.}) 51. Ra3 Rhh8 52. g4 Qb6 53. Qf1 Rc5 54. Qe2 Rhc8 55. Qf1 Kf7 56.

Gordon fully profits from this advantage.} Nxc3 7. Qd4 f6 8. Qxc3 e6 9. Bg2 $1
