1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bf4 {The London System at a Super tournament against
the Russian Champion! Now that is some confidence!} b6 4. e3 Bb7 5. h3 Be7 6.

We have a normal position out of the opening but now Magnus ups the Ante.} 13.
Bxg6 $5 hxg6 14. Bxd6 Qxd6 15. Ne5 $1 {This exchange on g6 and d6 led to
something important - good knight vs bad bishop scenario. The bishop on b7
just stands hemmed in by its own pawn on d5 while White will now harbour
ambitions of launching a kingside attack. Good players always leave their
opponents with the inferior minor piece. It is surprising how easily Carlsen
was able to do that to a sound player like Tomashevsky.} g5 16. f4 $5 (16. Ndf3
Ne4 $11) 16... gxf4 17. Rf1 $1 {Now you need nerves of steel in order to
navigate the complications that arise after taking the pawn on e3.} (17. exf4
cxd4 18. cxd4 Rac8 {Leaves Black with the open c-file and an excellent
position.}) 17... Nd7 (17... fxe3 18. Rxf6 {Of course this sacrifice is
natural. Many times you put your rook on the empty f6 square just to prevent
the f-pawn from moving ahead. Here it is even better!} exd2 {This is the
critical position of the game.} (18... gxf6 $2 {ends in total disaster after}
19. Qg4+ Kh7 20. Rf1 $1 (20. Qh4+ $6 Kg7 21. Ng4 Qf4 $19) 20... exd2 21. Rf4
$18 {And the mate on the kingside is inevitable.}) 19. Rxd2 $1 {Part of the
reason why this move is good is because I wouldn't like to move the rook from
f6.} (19. Rdf1 $1 {looks scary for sure but bad bishop on b7 comes to rescue.}

Rxf1 cxd4 24. cxd4 (24. Qh5+ $11 {should be the safer way to end the game.})

Rxd2 $1 {The variations are similar to the previous ones but just that the Q
is much better placed on h4 than it was on e2.}) 21. Qg4+ (21. Ng4 $1 {is also
good.}) 21... Kh7 22. Rf1 exd2 23. Rf4 Rh8 24. Qh5+ Kg7 25. Qxf7+ $18) 20. Rxf4
Ne4 $6 {Tomashevsky panics but the pressure was on him for quite some moves
now.} (20... cxd4 21. exd4 Ne4 {was a better way to continue.}) 21. Nxe4 $1
Qxh4 22. Rxh4 dxe4 23. dxc5 {The rook is ready to jump to d7 and we could say
that the rest is matter of technique for a player of Carlsen's calibre. But
let's looks at how he gets the job done.} bxc5 24. Rd7 Rab8 25. b3 $1 {A very
calm move not giving any counterplay.} a5 26. Rc7 a4 27. bxa4 $1 {This a5 pawn
will turn out to be a huge strength.} Ba8 28. a5 Rb7 (28... Rb1+ 29. Kh2 Rb2
30. a6 Rxa2 31. a7 {Followed by Rf4 will end the game.}) 29. Rxc5 Ra7 30. Nc4 {
This might be a premature resignation but against Magnus this might well be a
hopeless cause. What is particularly inspiring is that Carlsen played a non
main stream opening and got such a promising position. Usually the trend is
set by the World Champion. Will we see more London Systems tried by strong
players?!} 1-0
