Nc4 Rad8 16. Ne3 {[#] "Nothing has happened," one could say here. 16...Nf4 first comes to mind, but
Naiditsch has brought all his heavy pieces to the center and wants to break.}
d5 17. exd5 Bg7 {The best move.} (17 ... Nxd5 18. Ng4 $ 1 {gives White an
advantage.}) 18. d4 $ 1 (18. c4 c6 {doesn't yield White anything.}) 18 ... exd4 19.
cxd4 ({here 19.Qxd4 $ 1 {would have been best.) White would have had a
small edge against either Nd5 or Ne4.}) 19 ... Nxd5 20.
Nxd5 Rxe1 + 21. Qxe1 Qxd5 {[#] Now things are trending towards a draw, but it's not so simple.} 22. Bxc7 Rc8 23. Rc1
Bxd4 24. Qd2 Qd7 25. Nxd4 Rxc7 26. Rxc7 Qxc7 27. Nf5 {[#] Black is still fine, but this knight intrusion somehow leaves a bad feeling.} Kh7 28. g3 Ne5 29. Qe3 {[#]} Nc4 (29 ... f6
{maintaining the knight is the computer's way to keep the balance}) 30. Qc3 {An actual mate threat!} Qe5 31. Qd3 $1 {With a lot of tactical skill
Caruana puts pressure on his opponent. Given the reduced material
this is more than remarkable.} Nxb2 32. Qc2 Qe1 + 33. Kg2 Qd1 $1 {[#]
Naiditsch finds a creative defence, but he game has become very demanding.} 34.
Qe4 {[#] Caruana will not let up. Naiditsch has to contend not only with the
threats against his king, but also keep an eye on his loose knight.} Qxa4 ({
Here} 34 ... Qd7 $11 {was much better. White can not get to any of the possible
weak points on f7 and b7 with his knight}
35. Qe5 Qc6 + 36. Kg1 Qg6 $1) 35. Qxb7 {Now both
both f7 and the b2-knight are hanging.} Qa2 {Loses.} (35 ... Qe8 {was better:} 36.
Nd6 Qe6 37. Nxf7 Kg8 38. Nd8 Qf6 39. Qd5 + Kh7 40. Nf7 Nd1 41. Nxg5 + hxg5 42.
Qxd1 $16 {with a much better, but difficult queen ending for White.})
36. Ne3 $1 {[#] This innocuous looking move is the only winning one for reasons hard to comprehend. The white queen gains access to the b1-h7 diagonal while
at the same time the black queen is prevented from reaching d5. In some
variations, the knight can go to d5 or g4. At the same time, the Nb2 remains paralysed, which in turn has the consequence that the black queen
is tied down, while simultaneously needed to cover the weak squares around the black king...} Kg7 37. Qb4 Qb1 38.
g4 $1 {Gives the knight an anchor on f5.} Kg8 39. Nf5 Qc2 40. Qb8 +
Kh7 41. Qb7 Kh8 42. Qe7 {and Naiditsch resigned, since} Qc6+ 43. Kg1 Qg6 {drops the knight to Qe5+,
while if} (43... Qc1+ 44. Kh2 Qf4+ 45. Kg2 {black runs out of
checks.}) 1-0
