Nxf7 Kxf7 16. dxe5 Bxe5 17. Ra3 {[#]} Rb8 {Black is now making some haphazard moves that allow White to consolidate his position optimally.} (17... Re8 {Computers think this is the best plan. Black would have powerfully exploited the fact that the white king was still stuck on e1; for the moment castling is impossible as the h4 pawn would hang.}) 18. Nd2 Be6 19. Nf3 Re8 20. Nxe5+ dxe5 21. Rd3 Qe7 22. Ba3
c5 23. h5 g5 24. O-O {[#] Material remains balanced, but White has not only brought his king to safety, he also has more active pieces.} Red8 25. Rf3+ Kg8 26. Qc1 Rbc8 27. Bb2 {[#]
Black no longer has time to make a much needed consolidating move, h7-h6, but on the contrary, it is White how can play h6, and then threaten the g5 pawn. In desperation, Black gives up an exchange.} Rd4 28. Bxd4 exd4 29. Rg3 g4 30. f4 {But the game is decided.} Qh4 31. f5 Bf7 32. Qf4 Bxh5 33. Rh3 1-0
