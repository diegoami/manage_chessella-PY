Nf3 Bg4 4. cxd5 Bxf3 5. gxf3 Qxd5 6. e3 e5 7. Nc3 Bb4 8. Bd2 Bxc3 9. bxc3 {This is one of the most important positions in the opening and in general a good one to improve your understanding about the game of chess. White has the bishop pair and strong central pawns where as Black has a flawless pawn structure and two knights. All in all White should have a theoretical edge but it is not so easy for White to play as there is no safe parking spot for the king.} Qd6 10. Bd3 Nf6 11. Qc2 O-O (11... O-O-O {is the usual place for the black king. But as White has done nothing too active Black goes for 0-0.}) 12. O-O Rfd8 13. Rab1 b6 14. Rfd1 Ne7 15. Bf1 Ng6 16. Qf5 c5 17. Be1 cxd4 18. cxd4 Qc6 $1 {A powerful move taking aim at f3 pawn and threatening Nh4.} 19. Rbc1 Qb7 20. Qh3 (20. dxe5 Rxd1 21. Rxd1 Nh4 $17 {And the f3 pawn falls.}) 20... exd4 {White's pawn structure is completely ruined.} 21. Bg2 dxe3 22. fxe3 (22. f4 exf2+ 23. Bxf2 Nxf4 $19) 22... Qe7 23. Bf2 Rxd1+ 24. Rxd1 Qa3 25. f4 Rf8 26. Qf3 Re8 27. Qc6 Qxa2 { Black has two extra pawns but with the double bishops for her opponent she should remain careful.} 28. e4 Rf8 29. Qc1 Qe2 30.
