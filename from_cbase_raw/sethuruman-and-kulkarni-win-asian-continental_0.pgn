Even more so in the final round with a half point deficit, but Sethuraman thrives under such pressure and once again proves that he can beat anyone in any game. Just like he beat Tomashevsky in the last round of the 2015 Qatar Masters with the black pieces. } 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 {The Meran is the perfect choice for a must win situation. This was also what Ganguly played on board two against Le Quang Liem and won his game with the black pieces.} 6. Qc2 Bd6 7. g4 $5 {Wei Yi's choice can be questioned at this point. When he was in the lead why did he have to take so many risks? But this is the way he plays chess and this is the way he has reached above 2700! You cannot change the style of a chess player so easily.} Nxg4 8. Rg1 Qf6 9. Rxg4 Qxf3 10. Rxg7 Nf6 11. Rg5 { The threat is now Bg2 to trap the queen.} Qh1 12. Bd2 {The first new move of the game.} Bd7 13. O-O-O Qxh2 14. f4 Rg8 15. Bd3 O-O-O 16. cxd5 exd5 17. Nb5 Bb8 18. Qc5 b6 19. Nxa7+ {A very interesting piece sacrifice.} (19. Nd6+ Kc7 20. Qa3 $11 {was about even.}) 19... Kb7 (19... Bxa7 20. Qd6 {Threatening Ba6.} Kb7 21. Qxf6 $16) 20. Qe7 Qh6 $1 {Strong defence.} 21. Nxc6 Kxc6 22. Kb1 (22. Qa3 $1 Bg4 (22... Kb7 23. Qa6+ $18) 23. Rxg4 Nxg4 24. Kb1 {With good attacking chances.}) 22... Kb7 {Black is now a piece up and White needs to show his compensation.} 23. Rc1 Bc7 $1 24. Rf5 Ne4 25. Bxe4 dxe4 26. Rf6 Rg6 27. Rxf7 Rc6 28. Rxh7 Rxc1+ 29. Bxc1 Qc6 {White has three pawns but has clearly lost his attack and initiative. Black's king is more than safe and he slowly but surely activates his pieces.} 30. Rh2 Rc8 31. Rh7 Be6 32. b3 (32. Rh6 Bxa2+ $19 ) 32... Kb8 33. Kb2 Bf5 34. Rf7 Be6 35. Rh7 Rg8 36. Rg7 Re8 37. Qb4 Rh8 38. Qc3 Rh2+ 39. Bd2 Qxc3+ 40. Kxc3 {It is now just a case of breaking through because the bishop on d2 is quite passive and the pawns are not going anywhere.} b5 41. a3 Ba5+ 42. b4 Bc7 43. Rg6 Bd5 44. Rg5 Bc4 45. Rg1 Bd3 {The perfect spot for the bishop which safeguards the e4 and b5 pawns.} 46. Ra1 Bd6 47. Rg1 Kc7 48. Rg7+ Kc6 49. Rg1 Rf2 50. Rh1 Rg2 51. Ra1 Kd5 52. Rh1 Be7 53. Ra1 Rh2 54. Rg1 Ke6 55. Ra1 {It is actually not so usual to see Wei Yi being so helpless!} Rh8 56. Kb2 Kf5 57. a4 bxa4 58. Rxa4 Kg4 59. Ra7 Bh4 60. Rb7 Kf3 61. b5 Rh5 62. b6 Rb5+ 63.
